Pusher centrifuge;A pusher centrifuge type filtration technique offer continuous operation de-water wash material relatively in-compressible feed solid free-draining crystalline polymer fibrous substance It consists constant speed rotor fixed one several basket This assembly applied centrifugal force generated mechanically smaller unit hydraulically larger unit enable separation.Pusher centrifuge used variety application They typically used inorganic industry later extensively chemical industry organic intermediate plastic food processing rocket fuels.A suspension feed enters process undergo pre-acceleration distribution The subsequent process involve main filtration intermediate de-watering main filtrate collected Wash liquid enters washing step final de-watering follows Wash filtrate extracted two stage The final step involves discharge solid collected finished product These process step take place simultaneously different part centrifuge.It widely accepted due ease modification gas-tight explosion protection configurations.Pusher centrifuge mainly used chemical pharmaceutical food mainly produce sodium chloride common salt mineral industry During twentieth century pusher centrifuge used desiccation comparatively large crystal solids.Although pusher typically used inorganic product appear chemical industry organic intermediate plastic food processing rocket fuel Organic intermediate include paraxylene adipic acid oxalic acid caprolactam nitrocellulose carboxymethylcellulose etc.In food processing pusher centrifugation used produce monosodium glutamate salt lysine saccharin.Pusher centrifugation also used plastic industry contributing product PVC polyethylene polypropylene number resins.Individual productsThe design pusher centrifuge follows Pushers come eithermechanical and/or hydraulic drive unit Speed vary.Single-stage unit cylindrical cylindrical/conical single long basket screenMultistage two- three- four- stage design cylindrical cylindrical/conicalFeed distributor design conical/cylindrical plateThe important parameter screen area acceleration level final drainage zone cake thickness Cake filtration affect residence time volumetric throughput Residence screen controlled screen 's length diameter cake thickness frequency stroke length cake.Pushers utilise cake layer act filter hence feed normally contains high solid concentration containing fast draining crystalline granular fibrous solid The solid concentration range 25-65 wt The mean particle size suitable pusher must least 150 µm The capacity depends basket diameter range 1 ton/h 120tons/h.The cake centrifugal force It becomes drier progress basket discharged pusher basket solid discharge housing pusher centrifuge operation The stroke length range 30 80 mm stroke frequency 45 90strokes/min.The push efficiency defined distance forward movement cake ring divided stroke length The push efficiency function solid volumetric loading result self-compensating control varying rate Up 90 push efficiency achievable depending cake property dQ3ET42TThe equation filtration rate Q Where μ \displaystyle \mu ρ \displaystyle \rho

layer allows feed liquid pas Particle shape equally important determines surface area per unit mass As decrease le surface area available bind moisture providing drier cake.Filtration rate function viscosity feed fluid From equation 1 relationship filtration rate inversely proportional viscosity Increasing viscosity mean adding resistance fluid flow complicates separation fluid slurry Consequently throughput pusher de-rated.In case solid discharge capacity/hydraulic capacity limiting factor The usual limitation filtration rate Therefore solid processed increasing feed slurry concentration.The cake quality determined purity amount volatile matter.Wash liquid introduced cake order displace mother liquor along impurity The cake wash ratio normally 0.1 0.3 kg wash/kg solid displace least 95 feed fluid impurity within wash zone 's normal residence time.The amount volatile matter present discharge function centrifugal force G residence time force Separation increase G hence favour filtration rate illustrated equation 3 .where G \displaystyle G centrifugal force Ω \displaystyle \Omega angular speed r \displaystyle r radius basket g \displaystyle g gravitational force.By relating equation 3 equation 1 relationship centrifugal force shown proportional filtration rate As pusher often deal fragile crystal movement pusher plate acceleration feed funnel matter break particle In addition movement plate G cause breakage compaction volatile matter cake increase The gentle movement cake low G single stage long basket design result low particle attrition As solid pas residence time decrease increase volatile matter discharge cake.The heuristic pusher centrifuge design consider equipment size operation sequence recycle structure.Overall approach Variables considered sizing equipment Equipment selection based upon test result reference similar process experience considered term For conical cylindrical design assembly cone slant angle exceed sliding friction cake angle Otherwise would result high vibration poor performance.In order optimise capacity performance desirable pre-concentrate feed slurry much possible Some design short conical section feed end thickening within unit generally preferable thicken entering centrifuge gravity settler hydrocyclones inclined screen producing higher concentration solids.The volumetric throughput multistage design increased increasing forced cake height still retaining acceptable push efficiency.Selection design usually done scale-up lab test Test data analysis rationalised preparation equipment scale-up Computer-aided design software assist design scale-up Pilot-testing rollout follows.The majority liquid contained within mixture drawn early stage feed zone slot screen It discharged filtrate housing After formation solid cake main by-product produced water may used sort industrial usage Filtration cake washed using nozzle waste baskets.Post-treatment process function specific waste stream diverse.Design advance enhanced performance broaden application range These include additional stage push hesitation horizontal split process housing integrated hydraulics seal pre-drained funnel integrated thickening function.B & P Process Equipment Systems B & P make largest single-stage pusher centrifuge claimed superior multistage design They claimed additional impurity enter liquid housing due additional particle tumbling stage The problem overcome using shorter inner basket smaller diameter pusher plate basket enabling pusher movement take place pusher plate basket well inner basket outer basket Compared single-stage pusher pusher movement pusher plate basket multistage centrifuge advantage cake height reduced filtration resistance lower lesser force required.Push hesitation hold pusher plate back stroke allowing cake build The cake act filtering medium even capture finer solid This reduces loss solid passing wedge slot Although modification reduces capacity helped improved solid capture efficiency make pusher centrifuge applicable smaller particles.This allows removal rotating assembly without disassembling basket pusher centrifuge shafting assembly.An automated mechanism allows system operate independently.Shaft seal eliminate possibility cross-contamination hydraulic process end Options include centrifugal liquid ring seal non-contacting inert gas purged labyrinth seal eliminates leakage.The pre-drained funnel remove portion feed fluid puncture surface This feature help concentrate feed especially important drainage-limited application However funnel back-washed therefore feature available crystal tend back-crystallise.Integrating thickening function enables pusher loaded mixture little 30-35 wt solid It also reduces process cost solid-liquid separation much 20

Active redundancy;Active redundancy design concept increase operational availability reduces operating cost automating critical maintenance actions.This concept related condition-based maintenance fault reporting.The initial requirement began military combat system World War I The approach used survivability install thick armor plate resist gun fire install multiple guns.This became unaffordable impractical Cold War aircraft missile system became common.The new approach build distributed system continue work component damaged This depends upon crude form artificial intelligence perform reconfiguration obeying specific rule An example approach AN/UYK-43 computer.Formal design philosophy involving active redundancy required critical system corrective labor undesirable impractical correct failure normal operation.Commercial aircraft required multiple redundant computing system hydraulic system propulsion system single in-flight equipment failure cause loss life.A recent outcome work Internet relies backbone router provide ability automatically re-route communication without human intervention failure occur.Satellites placed orbit around earth must include massive active redundancy ensure operation continue decade longer despite failure induced normal failure radiation-induced failure thermal shock.This strategy dominates space system aircraft missile systems.Maintenance requires three action usually involve time high priority labor cost Active redundancy eliminates time reduces manpower requirement automating three action This requires amount automated artificial intelligence.N stand needed equipment The amount excess capacity affect overall system reliability limiting effect failure.For example take two generator power city N+1 would three generator allow single failure Similarly N+2 would four generator would allow one generator fail second generator already failed.Active redundancy improves operational availability follows.Active redundancy passive component requires redundant component share burden failure occurs like cabling piping This allows force redistributed across bridge prevent failure vehicle rupture cable.This allows water flow redistributed pipe limited number valve shut pump shut down.Active redundancy active component requires reconfiguration failure occurs Computer programming must recognize failure automatically reconfigure restore operation All modern computer provide following existing feature enabled via fault reporting.Mechanical device must reconfigure transmission setting hybrid vehicle redundant propulsion system The petroleum engine start battery power fails.Electrical power system must perform two action prevent total system failure smaller failure occur tree fall across power line Power system incorporate communication switching automatic scheduling allows action automated.This known strategy achieve high availability.This maintenance philosophy requires custom development extra component

missile approached target detail radar video transmitted missile improved The missile began terminal dive 20 mile 32 km target 16 The command guidance system send directional signal encrypted made susceptible detection jamming.The guidance system developed Bell GAM-63A version RASCAL produced CEP 1,500 foot 460 The accuracy claim inertial guidance system questioned sources. It possible drop RASCAL gravity bomb system malfunction occurred flight In case missile would used would attack le heavily defended target 9 The RASCAL 's forward section interchangeable different target Using capability RASCAL could equipped nuclear biological chemical blast incendiary warhead The requirement biological chemical warhead dropped end 1953 On 5 December 1949 requirement RASCAL called nuclear warhead weighing 3,000 pound 1,400 kg 5,000 pound 2,300 kg The RASCAL warhead compartment accommodated cylinder 3.8 foot 1.2 diameter 6.25 foot 1.91 length The USAF also wanted ability use RASCAL standard gravity bomb missile could readied launch.In January 1950 Bell began study nuclear warhead available RASCAL The W-5 nuclear warhead initially considered On 20 August 1950 Special Weapons Development Board SWDB authorized W-5/RASCAL integration effort .. 17 119–123 The Atomic Energy Commission AEC responsible developing fuzing system RASCAL warhead No provision made surface burst time In April 1952 fuze development shifted Bell resulted USAF policy make airframe contractor responsible nuclear weapon fuzing since system needed integrated missile 's guidance system .. 17 119–123 Bell developed two complete fuzing system airburst surface burst Then March 1956 W-5/RASCAL program canceled.In July 1955 W-27 nuclear warhead considered replacement W-5 RASCAL 18 USAF requirement W-27 called 2,800 lb 1,300 kg nuclear warhead either electronic countermeasure equipment infrared countermeasure equipment extra fuel increase range RASCAL A design adaption kit W-27 RASCAL completed January 1957 RASCAL canceled .. 17 135–136 Three bomber originally considered RASCAL launch platform The B-29 removed front line service RASCAL development In March 1952 USAF turned B-36 B-47 RASCAL missile carrier The B-36 assigned first priority RASCAL The USAF Strategic Air Command agree decision use B-47 carry RASCAL SAC wished substitute B-47 B-50 proposing field single squadron RASCAL equipped B-50s B-36s It determined RASCAL-carrying B-50s would need based outside United States B-50 would le range carrying RASCAL The decision eliminate B-50 RASCAL carrier reached June 1956 A single B-50 used launch platform support RASCAL test program 1955 A cradle lowered RASCAL B-50 's bomb bay launch The first powered RASCAL launched test B-50 30 September 1952 White Sands Missile Range New Mexico United StatesIn May 1953 12 DB-36H director-bombers ordered Convair Each bomber would equipped carry single RASCAL missile The RASCAL occupied B-36 's aft bomb bay carried semi-submerged A portion missile located inside aircraft portion missile hung aircraft One forward bomb bay used hold equipment required RASCAL 's guidance system The retractable antenna command guidance system installed rear aircraft.The first YDB-36H flown 3 July 1953 Six captive carry flight flown 31 July 1953 16 August 1953 The addition missile B-36 increase drag change handling characteristic bomber An un-powered RASCAL dropped YDB-36H 25 August 1953 On 21 December 1954 DB-36H delivered Air Force use RASCAL test program Holloman Air Force Base New Mexico United States By June 1955 least two missile launched B-36 Convair completed manufacturing modification kit 12 planned aircraft Two kit installed B-36 aircraft USAF decided carry RASCAL B-47 bomber.Before end 1952 Boeing received contract USAF modify two B-47Bs prototype RASCAL missile carrier A removable missile support strut installed right side B-47 Extra internal structure installed support load strut missile While carrying RASCAL B-47 could carry weapon The guidance equipment RASCAL added B-47 bomb bay The retractable antenna needed RASCAL added rear fuselage Both aircraft sent Holloman Air Force Base support RASCAL test program After completion two DB-47B prototype delay RASCAL 's development effectively placed DB-47 modification effort hold March 1955 Then June 1955 Boeing received contract modify 30 DB-47Bs carry RASCAL.The Strategic Air Command concerned externally mounting RASCAL associated internal equipment needed support missile would seriously degrade performance bomber The performance impact great enough make B-47/RASCAL combination questionable value SAC also argued B-47/RASCAL combination might never work well Since equipment added B-47 guide missile added complexity already complex B-47 Then modification cost required carry RASCAL added nearly US $ 1 million cost every B-47 To SAC cost seemed premature considering state RASCAL 's development time Finally SAC considered unwise commit aircraft start training crew missile 's development completed.The Strategic Air Command considered GAM-63 value Air Staff wished press deployment RASCAL SAC actively prevented B-52 used RASCAL carrier The USAF decided use B-47E RASCAL missile carrier Boeing contracted convert two B-47E YDB-47E aircraft The first YDB-47E flew January 1954 The first successful RASCAL launch DB-47E occurred July 1955 The mission bomber changed 1956 high altitude penetration low level penetration evade enemy radar The fact minimum launch altitude RASCAL 35,000 foot 11,000 meant low altitude delivery impossible 8 RASCAL test launch White Sands Missile RangeThe actual mission profile Rascal quite restrained The mission began moment carrier aircraft left ramp took towards predetermined launch point assigned target Guidance launch dependent upon DB-47E ’ MA-8 navigation system determined course preplanned launch point automatically launched missile launch point reached The flight Rascal began 19 degree climb angle altitude 65,000 foot leveled For first 73 Nautical mile roughly 195 second Rascal inertially guided When guidance system determined missile 17 nautical mile target autopilot put missile 35-degree dive Then terminal radar guidance switched The operator guidance system interpret vision radar screen providing decide either monitor correct missile course 8–9 SAC interested Rascal operational restriction well significantly affecting cost usefulness launch airplane.In early 1956 USAF limited DB-47E production two aircraft In May 1957 USAF decided field one instead two DB-47 squadron equipped RASCAL missile Strategic Air Command leadership believed RASCAL already obsolete By December 1957 USAF 445th Bomb Squadron USAF 321st Bomb Wing training RASCAL The first production RASCAL accepted Pinecastle Air Force Base 30 October 1957 Funding shortage would prevent facility built Pinecastle Air Force Base 1959 In August 1958 review previous 6 month RASCAL testing revealed 65 scheduled test launch one launch success More half test launch canceled others failures.On 29 September 1958 USAF terminated RASCAL program.The AGM-28 Hound Dog replaced GAM-63 program The first flight test Hound Dog April 1959 first operational Hound Dog delivered USAF December 1959 The first Hound Dog equipped SAC squadron reached initial operational capability July

Bi-partisan appointment republican model;The Bi-partisan appointment republican model proposal Australian constitutional reform If approved referendum model would established Australia republic Head State appointed Australian Federal Parliament The model put people November 1999 republican referendum defeated 54.4 voters.Under model nomination Head State President could made Australian citizen group citizen These would received nomination committee established Parliament The committee would provide report Prime Minister suitable candidate position The Prime Minister would select candidate securing support Leader Opposition This bi-partisan part procedure give model name.The formal appointment Head State would made joint sitting Parliament attended member Senate House Representatives A special two-thirds majority would required ratify candidate 's appointment Head State.The power proposed Head State would substantially different reigning Monarch Governor General The Head State would vested power executive government power would normally exercised advice ministers.Under model term Head State would five year The Head State could removed Prime Minister decision would subject confirmation House Representatives within thirty day Any vacancy post would temporarily filled longest-serving state governor.If implemented model would established Australian Republic removing constitutional link monarchy References either Queen Governor-General Australian constitution would replaced reference President Australia.Supporters model argued appointed president would carry presidential duty similar fashion current Governor-General method appointment requires combined support major political party The President would continue act advice Prime Minister otherwise would invite dismissal Consequently change republic argued minimal impact rest Australia 's parliament government.Although 1999 referendum limited federal jurisdiction model able adopted little modification six Australian state formally break tie monarchy.The model criticised lack democratic quality The Head State elected people Prime Minister may legally ignore nomination made ordinary citizen The model specifically criticised allowing Prime Minister dismiss Head State.The model also criticised bi-partisan mechanism According deliberate seeking support Prime Minister Opposition Leader definition political adversary may influence outcome policy contest The mandate implicitly conferred two-thirds parliament may encourage President make use reserve powers.The model originally developed legal academic George Winterton influenced system used Europe The central concept President appointed two-thirds majority parliament Subsequent judicial process President could dismissed absolute majority house parliament After consulting expert proposal drafted amendment published Independent Monthly March 1992 supported Australian Republican Movement ARM .In 1993 model reviewed one four option Republic Advisory Committee chaired Malcolm Turnbull shortly became ARM chairman Prime Minister Paul Keating presented slightly altered version providing appointment dismissal two-thirds majority parliament He declared version often called Keating-Turnbull Model put people.Under Prime Minister John Howard model closely examined criticised 1998 constitutional convention The model evolved incorporate nomination committee authority dismiss Head State taken parliament given Prime Minister With change model supported simple majority 73 152 delegate 22 abstaining An absolute majority 89 agreed put people.At 1999 Australian republic referendum model supported opposition party progressive conservative feared future directly elected president monarchist favouring republican model rejected The referendum failed especially large majority rural outer suburban electorates.After defeat Australian Republican Movement downgraded model 's status preferred one six possible option Its long-term future likely depend result proposed model plebiscite would allow elector directly show support version republicanism

Voter turnout in the European Parliament elections;Elections European Parliament saw declining voter turnout 1979 2014 However voter turnout 2019 European election increased 8 point compared 2014 In spite exception Member States electoral mobilization remains weak compared national parliamentary election Moreover turnout significantly differs one country another Europe across time 2019 Belgium citizen participated 88.47 Slovakians le 22.74 The potential factor might influence trend implication attracted great scholarly attention Identifying analysing factor determine relative low turnout European election therefore critical one element weakens democratic legitimacy European Parliament.While gender-equal turnout national election established democracy mostly reached new cohort woman entered electorate men still slightly inclined woman participate European election Indeed 2019 gap 3 point -1 pp compared 2014 still observed woman 49 +8 pp men turnout 52 +7pp .This gender gap seem rooted neither gender per se institutional feature European Parliament present egalitarian representation woman member country lower house The literature rather emphasis political socialisation 10 woman le likely turnout express lower level interest knowledge politics 11 election considered le important e.g European level .In spite 2004 enlargement considerably lowered voting age younger people always participated le European election elder 12 An important part literature 13 14 emphasis effect age life-cycle 15 according young people le likely vote still transition adulthood 16 building professional career family 15 Through ageing individual acquire resource political experience 17 face fewer time constraint 15 stronger conformist behaviour voting 18 pushing cast vote.Another part literature stress trend might due age per se 15 socialisation experience individual acquire habit voting greater lesser extent 17 previous next generation Smets considers later maturation young adult day ... le inclined vote parent grandparent younger year 19 While 2014 explanation found supporting evidence European election unexpected turnout increase 2019 noticeably driven greater mobilisation younger people reducing generational gap compared 2014 20 Indeed individual aged 55 still represent majority electorate 54 +3 pp participation people aged 25 42 aged 25–39 47 grown respectively 14 12 pp compared 2014 21 As national election scholar mainly agree individual higher level education income socio-economic status likely vote In 2019 participation highly educated individual left education age 20 grew 36 39 compared 2014 turnout people continue school 15 year old decreased 14 18 Similarly positive relationship socio-economic status turnout also increased time employed individual especially manager white collar manual worker likely 2019 unemployed people cast vote 21 While comparable positive relationship found financial situation ie 54 voter general difficulty pay bill people financial difficulty also inclined vote 2014 38 +6 pp 22 Moreover voter profile 2019 urban 2014.Although sociological factor strong predictor per se political engagement depict one part picture First level “ education income steadily increased industrialized democracy past 50 year 23 electoral participation generally declined national European election except 2014 Additionally Mattila consider analysis “ descriptive explanatory ” 24 limited explaining process turnout fostered Besides considered fail explain turnout decline occurred education level share middle class increased European democracy 25 High level knowledge 26 interest politics 27 sense duty vote regular consumption news medium engage political discussion 28 commonly considered significant predictor turnout If explanatory power political interest increased last European election individual strong political interest 4 likely vote 2014 20 24 similar increase observed among abstainer 21 However Stockemer Blais argue related national politics good knowledge strong interest strong sense duty vote might sufficient explain participation European election 29 Stockemer Blais found someone expressing sense duty vote national level 10 le chance vote national European election someone also perceives duty EU level The last European election boosted greater sense civic duty 30 compared 2014.Other attitude towards domestic politics might matter People affiliating right left political scale continuously inclined vote European election individual centre political scale 22 Another focus made government approval trust national institution perceived corruption national level 31 Although stronger government disapproval clearly encourage people go poll 32 clear correlation strong confidence towards national institution greater turnout European election enlightened far 33 34 .The effect EU-related attitude participation European election somehow debated While emphasised pro-European attitude efficient foster voting participation European election Eurosceptic one 26 35 others 36 37 27 argued significance attitude negligible non-existent controlling sociodemographic attitudinal variable mentioned 37 Accounting attachment European identity 38 Studlar et al found positive relationship stronger attachment notion among voter turnout 39 In vein analysing European election 1979 2009 Stockemer found consider country 's membership EU ‘ good thing ’ higher likelihood voting EP election reject 40 Not 2019 post election survey confirmed trend also compared 2014 respondent ... voted favour EU declared support main voting motivator 20 Similarly literature stress distrust European institution politician also considered strong motivation individual decide abstain 26 41 42 Overall EU related attitude focus also considered over-simplistic treating “ public attitude towards EU one-dimensional ... taking positive negative value ” disregarding existing “ ambivalent indifferent feeling ” 43 Studying 2004 2009 election Kentmen‐Cin show ambivalent individual simultaneously hold positive negative EU attitude likely cast vote compared negative indifferent attitude 44 Therefore bearing contradictory view European integration ambivalent people prefer raise voice rather exiting seeing vote opportunity improve EU system 43 Accounting ambivalence indifference even relevant view “ second order ” status European election many elector 45 see institutional factor .Cross-national analysis emphasis institutional factor related electoral system Increasing financial moral cost abstention 42 role compulsory voting explaining general turnout decline widely recognised literature 46 36 Indeed 1979 40 percent participating country compulsory voting 2019 system remained active Belgium Luxembourg effect variable become increasingly diluted 47 Mattila underline role open party list compared strict one extending variety choice voter beyond political party candidate turn foster turnout Similarly holding election multiple constituency may encourage voter participate choosing candidate feel closer constituency whose easier obtain information 48 Other scholar consider pattern party competition follows higher number political party winning seat European election meaningful voter choice likely encourage turnout 49 Studying European election 1979 1999 Studlar et al demonstrate hosting Eu institution founding member European Community foster greater EU awareness might result greater turnout 49 Turnout difference old new Member States attracted great scholarly attention 50 Historically speaking Wessels Franklin proposed challenge Rose 's thesis 51 limited voting participation new member state due “ post‐communist ” status i.e “ lack trust political party government legacy communist rule ” arguing cross-national difference turnout partially due weaker “ European identity political community ” eastern state constrain/limit “ political commitment participation ” 52 Economically speaking Mattila show building upon Gabel 's research 53 citizen living net beneficiary country i.e benefiting financially EU membership likely cast vote living contributor country According information spread medium political sphere given country finance member country tax ” might influence citizen decision abstain 54 Finally according Franklin 2004 election new EU country lost boost turnout new member country generally enjoy first EP election 55 Reif Schmitt 45 developed 1980 second-order theory famous explanation EP election 56 generated fruitful literature According theory European election dominated domestic political cleavage ... happen different stage national political system ’ respective “ electoral cycle ” 57 implying lower turnout le stake domestic election 58 Some scholar emphasise effect perceived low salience 59 European Parliament decision-making process intention vote 60 others 60 61 underline citizen European integration addressing issue distant everyday life “ sufficient interest awareness emotional attachment 62 Indeed EU especially European Parliament remain mainly non competent citizen main priority reduce poverty inequality combat terrorism organised crime improve quality education 63 In vein Hobolt et al argue governing party generally far pro-European typical voter thus discouraging cast vote 64 In order reduce second election problem Bright Garzia Lacey provided evidence transnationalising Europe ’ voting space ... would force political party move away campaigning solely national issue 65 Building Van der Eijk et al stress European election unlike national one le important precisely play role deciding governs country 66 As response continuous turnout decline spizenkanditat process 2014 European election expected establish direct electoral connection voter appointment president commission 67 Such personalisation intended ensure ‘ public identification option EU table winner loser EU 68 While electoral participation increased country 69 whether due phenomenon others factor role still debated issue Moreover majority voter show 2014 70 Hobolt concludes process significant impact voter attitude happened le interested choice candidate expected 70 Taking step back rational-choice approach study analyse impact contextual factor turnout Sunday voting found increase turnout 71 decrease cost voting 42 Similarly closeness another election 72 shorter time next election 71 grow incentive party mobilize supporter lead higher turnout 49 Other circumstantial reason abstention considered pressure work busy simply ‘ time ’ together account 29 circumstantial abstention 73 Some scholar consider so-called communication deficit partially responsible low public interest turnout European election Greater positive medium coverage European issue actor electoral campaign associated higher turnout 74 75 76 even scepticism remains 77 Media coverage 2014 election increasingly integrated Europeanized public sphere across Member States citizen access similar European issue European actor EU responsibility national framing also remained dominant 78 This trend also observed post electoral survey 2019 44 respondent recalled seeing hearing message European Parliament encouraging citizen vote This recall highest among respondent actually voted election 50 also 39 non-voters recall seen heard element Parliament 's go-to-vote message .Focusing political communication medium political discussion scholar admit limit approach leading often “ ‘ blame messenger ’ deep-rooted ill body politic ” 79 An accurate understanding rising abstention European election conducted without accounting role mobilizing agency “ political party activating support ” 80 Thus scholar debate impact exposure electoral campaign turnout European election 38 A large part literature found evidence mobilisation campaigning efficient national EU level 81 82 Through mobilization deficit hypothesis Wessels Franklin found strong campaigning effort spread information medium mobilize voter significantly foster turnout 83 Building upon framework Marquart Goldberg propose distinguish citizen ’ passive exposure medium coverage EP election campaign targeted effort party active engagement i.e information research engagement within electoral campaign 84 They found boosting abstainer change mind active engagement efficient exposure political poster sufficient 85 Furthermore stressed potentially ‘ toxic ’ information communication environment social medium diversity opinion information also increase likelihood citizen exposed critical content Union thus go poll 85 Traditional right left-wing party dominated post-war European politics continuously lost voter Between 2014 2019 Christian Democrats EPP Social Democrats lost 39 37 seat respectively 86 As explanation Hix Harsh emphasise European election seen opportunity voter punish party government 87 Party size might also effect larger political party term vote-share previous national election vote lose subsequent European election 88 Alternatively van der Eijk Egmond argue turnout impact differs according placement party political scale While right-wing party benefit slightly average left-wing party average somewhat hurt 89 In country France United Kingdom Denmark Austria phenomenon correlated “

successor Turkish-language descriptive grammar G.L Lewis ’ Turkish Grammar 1967 Robert Underhill 's Turkish Grammar 1976 11 12 Her work provided thorough investigation syntactical morphological property Turkish defining key typological feature universal characteristic 13 Her work contribution Descriptive Grammars series Routledge publishing company The series overview variety language lens theoretical descriptive analysis using framework called Questionnaire structural tool comparing grammar across language type 13 More specifically Questionnaire survey language feature manner Kornfilt 's text one first Turkish grammar incorporate overtly native speaker 's linguistic intuition language description 13 Kornfilt indicates various degree ungrammatical sentence may judged ungrammatical As explains preface nother unusual feature book especially syntax chapter probably fact shading grammaticality acceptability noted rather reflecting all-or-nothing approach 11 Structure TurkishIn preface Kornfilt trace genealogical history Turkish Turkic language speaker member Altaic language family She note Turkish written Arabic script beginning history Anatolian peninsula orthography converted Latin alphabet following language reform 1928 upon establishment Republic Turkey She emphasizes Modern Standard Turkish focus book 13 In five chapter survey Syntax Morphology Phonology Ideophones Interjections Lexicon With total 575 page book devotes overwhelming majority attention Syntax Morphology Given even Morphology chapter often describes syntactical property Kornfilt primarily interested syntax Turkish 13 Ch 1 Syntax 211 pagesCh 2 Morphology 270 pagesCh 3 Phonology 32 pagesCh 4 Ideophones Interjections 3 pagesCh 5 Lexicon 16 page Syntax Morphology Across sixteen subpart chapter survey aspect Turkish syntax sentence type subordination internal sentence structure phrasal unit negation anaphora reflexive reciprocal comparative construction equatives possessive

relationship palatal glide copula auxiliary word class Previous grammar Lewis 1967 Underhill 1976 identified -DIr -IDI -ImIş copula auxiliary 13 Kornfilt argues palatal glide belongs category well show predicate noun adjective adverbial stem-final vowel glide precedes tense suffix one agreement suffix tense 11 Additionally Kornfilt denies existence separate topic marker Turkish syntax This contradicts view form -ise copula conditional particle de topic marker following sentence 13 Sentence 1 'Fasulye-yi ise en çok Ayşe sev-iyor.Bean-Acc Cop Supl Ayşe love-pres 'As bean Ayşe like Sentence 2 Fasulye-yi de en çok Ayşe sev-iyor.Bean-Acc Part Supl Ayşe love-pres 'As bean Ayşe like 'Written book The World ’ Language Families 1990 Kornfilt 's chapter “ Turkish Turkic Languages ” 14 secondary signature work Continuing contribution language typology comparative grammar Kornfilt highlight key linguistic feature make Turkic language unique The chapter highly cited source comparative linguistics regard Turkish. “ General Historical Background ” Kornfilt provides background Turkish Turkic language She specifies Turkic language share similar feature including vowel harmony agglutinative morphology verb-final word order nominalised subordinate clause She argues Turkic language share feature often difficult count total number completely separate Turkic language Additionally introduces controversy external genetic relationship Turkic family She describes majority opinion agrees Turkic language belong overarching Altaic language family along Mongolian Tungusic language outlier perspective claim Korean Japanese even Uralic language Altaic well.With regard geographical grouping Turkic language Kornfilt acknowledges broad consensus classification Ultimately chooses classify Modern Standard Turkish spoken Republic Turkey part Anatolian dialect Osman language group part larger South-West Oyuz group Turkic languages. “ Phonology Orthography ” Kornfilt highlight phonological characteristic Turkish She begin remarking symmetry Turkish vowel four pair high non-high vowel varying backness rounding She state non-high vowel round word-initial syllable She argues prominent property Turkish vowel adherence vowel harmony regularly assimilate one another match according backness rounding.Kornfilt also explores orthographic characteristic written Turkish While Turkish adopted Latin script following writing reform 1928 change Republic Turkey made characterization letter As Kornfilt describes Instead -i sign used high back non-round vowel find ı i.e dotless The difference two non-round high vowel signalled way capital letter I front I back high non-round vowel ... Other letter ’ correspond familiar phonetic symbol following c j ç č ş š j ž .Additionally Kornfilt explores feature Turkish phonology syllable-final oral stop devoicing k/0 alternation word-final liquid devoicing morpheme-initial voicing assimilation vowel harmony labial attraction word-final stress. “ Morphology ” Kornfilt begin commenting highly agglutinative suffixing nature Turkish Virtually morpheme Turkish carry suffix morpheme explicit function The prefixing operation Turkish intensification adjective adverb via reduplication first syllable addition consonant e.g beyaz 'white bembeyaz 'completely white çabuk 'fast çarçabuk 'very fast .She go survey productive suffix Turkish along rule governing order combined More specifically survey NP-MovementKornfilt also contributed understanding Government Binding theory originally proposed Chomsky Kornfilt asserts CP-transparency proposed generative theory Turkish syntax refutes role restructuring construction violate clause-dependent government rule 15 Specifically focus NP-movement embedded object matrix subject position specific kind construction Turkish note non-local application otherwise local process 15 The construction called “ Infinitival Double Passives ” IDPs characterized follows 15 The following example sentence Turkish IDPs 15 Sentence 1 üniversite-ler polis tarafından kuşat-ıl-mak

language normally explained Exceptional Case Marking ECM ECM operate Turkish—or least operate way would explain anomaly non-local cross-clausal rule application demonstrated Turkish IDPs Accordingly Kornfilt proposes question “ If IDPs explainable ECM grammatical ” Turkish 15 Her solution The three IDP verb trigger another type Transparency maximal projection purely descriptively speaking instead CP dominates verbal IP becomes transparent CP dominates nominal IP rather verbal IP 15 In word CP-Transparency found factive context render embedded subject rule government via matrix verb also present non-factive context well Turkish example Her proposal link CP-Transparency phenomenon traditional effect S-bar Deletion ‘ offending ’ trace embedded subject position properly governed main verb saved violating Empty Category Principle 15 Consequently dismisses ECP satisfying account Turkish grammar Additionally dismisses traditional explanation “ Restructuring ” case Turkish IDPs violates Projection Principle Chomsky 's Government Binding theory instead suggests “ CP-Transparency ” viable alternative explanation maintains consistent commitment Government Binding account cross-clausal application mono-clausal government found Turkish IDPs 15 Disagreement Kornfilt 's accountWayne Harbert opposed Kornfilt review article 16 claiming Turkish example Kornfilt used “ apparent real instance non-local application NP-movement ” 16 He argued Kornfilt non-problem hand mistakenly giving explanation something simpler viable reasoning He stated Kornfilt incorrect say passive morphology observed main subordinate clause Turkish “ result particular linkage INFL Inflectional node two clause ” rather passivity realized main clause “ embedded clause passive fact failure passivized object get case moving matrix subject position would result ill-formedness ” 16 Harbert presented various case study demonstrated various degree relaxed government rule several language grammar allowing occasional exception rule grammar adopting non-standard treatment structure effectively minimize syntactic distance related element without movement ” 16 In effect Harbert attempted minimize novelty Kornfilt 's Turkish IDPs presenting case non-local government abnormality languages.Properties Scrambling TurkishIn article Scrambling Subscrambling Case Turkish 2003 17 Kornfilt examines phenomenon scrambling Turkish grammar She examines role specificity play interaction scrambling subscrambling typology Case She also observes extent Specificity Effect autonomous independent principle grammar She demonstrates Specificity Effect actually by-product syntactic principle particularly Condition Extraction Domains CED suggests by-product Subajency Additionally Kornfilt demonstrates CED insufficient explaining feature Turkish especially involving structural Case 17 As alternative Kornfilt suggests syntactic incorporation N 's verb provides better account scrambling Turkish CED.Against scrambling instance Move-Alpha In article Against scrambling instance Move-alpha 1994 18 Kornfilt survey weighs popular understanding scrambling Namely acknowledges two major view scrambling according first scrambling instance Chomsky-adjoining XP NP PP limited extant also AP ADV VP IP perhaps also AP instance movement A'-position 18 second view proposes certain sub-cases scrambling instance A-movement 18 Kornfilt argues scrambling explained movement account Instead proposes base-generation account committed inadequacy non-configurational account German syntax 18 She make use morphosyntactic lexical property independently attested language.Direct ObjectsIn article The case direct object Turkish Semantics syntax morphology 2005 19 Kornfilt observes relationship semantic parameter morphological constraint determining distribution accusative case marker I Turkish 19 She note two mainstream understanding accusative marker The first considers marker instance Differentiated Object Marking DOM The caveat perspective assumes case suffix mark direct object similar archetypical subject 19 The second perspective based observation accusative marker closely related direct object 's specificity instead similarity direct object typical subject Kornfilt argues neither perspective give satisfying explanation distribution accusative case marker Alternatively Kornfilt insists suffix explicitly indicates specificity certain morpho-syntactic condition instead mere contrast subject 19 This proposal flexible notion specificity term referentially anchored indefinite NPs 19 This ultimately mean accusative case marker indicate referential property direct object including specificity according certain morphological environment predictable manner context
