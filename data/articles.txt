Paul Francis Leibold;"Paul Francis Leibold (December 22, 1914 – June 1, 1972) was an American clergyman of the Roman Catholic Church.   He served as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati in Ohio from 1969 to 1972.Leibold previously served as bishop of the Diocese of Evansville in Indiana from 1966 to 1969 and as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati from 1958 to 1966.Paul Leibold was born on December 22, 1914, in Dayton, Ohio, to Frank and Philomena (née Kirchner) Leibold.[1] He attended Holy Trinity primary school and Chaminade High School, both in Dayton.  Leibold then spent two years of college at the University of Dayton.  After deciding to enter the priesthood, he entered St. Gregory Seminary, then finished his preparation at Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Cincinnati[1][2][3]Leibold was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati on May 18, 1940, by Archbishop John T. McNicholas.[2]  He served as pastor of St. Louis Parish in Cincinnati, and assistant chancellor and chancellor for the archdiocese.[3]In the late 1950's, Leibold became the spiritual advisor for Mildred Ephrem Neuzil, a nun from Our Lady of the Nativity Convent in New Riegel, Ohio.  Between 1956 and 1959, Neuzil reported that Mary, mother of Jesus, had appeared to her on several occasions and proclaimed herself as the "Lady of America".  According to Neuzil, the apparitions gave her a message calling for Americans to return to purity.  Leibold gave his approval for private devotion to Our Lady and allowed the striking of a medal to honor her.[4]On April 10, 1958, Leibold was appointed as titular bishop of Trebenna and as auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati by Pope John XXXIII.[2]  Leibold was consecrated on June 17, 1958, by Archbishop Karl Joseph Alter.On April 4, 1966,  Leibold was appointed by Pope Paul VI as bishop of the Diocese of Evansville. He was installed on June 15, 1966.[2]Pope Paul VI appointed Leibold as the sixth archbishop of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati on July 23, 1969. He was installed on October 2, 1969.[2] One historian has characterized Leibold as "both a warm-hearted, approachable pastor and a hard-worker."[3] Leibold strengthened the Priests' Senate, the Pastoral Council, and the parish councils of the archdiocese. He also launched the archdiocese's sixth synod, Synod '71.[3]As archbishop, Leibold allowed the publication of two pamphlets about the Neuzil apparitions.  He also commissioned a wooden plaque with an image of Our Lady of America for display at the New Riegel convent.[4] In September 1971, Leibold criticized composer Leonard Bernstein's theatrical work Mass, terming it as offensive.[5]Paul Leibold died at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati on June 1, 1972 after suffering a stroke that day.[5][3]  He is buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Bishop Leibold School in  Miamisburg, Ohio, and the Archbishop Leibold Home for the Aged in Cincinnati are named for him.In 2020, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops commissioned a panel of five bishops to investigate the Neuzil apparitions.  The panel concluded that her apparitions were not supernatural in nature and that public devotion to them was not appropriate.[6]"
Baeksang Arts Award for Best Drama;"The Baeksang Arts Award for Best Drama (Korean: 백상예술대상 TV부문 드라마 작품상, RR: Baeksang yesul daesang TV bumun deurama jakpumsang) is an award presented annually at the Baeksang Arts Awards ceremony organised by Ilgan Sports and JTBC Plus, affiliates of JoongAng Ilbo, usually in the second quarter of each year in Seoul.[1]"
Mandraka Dam;"Mandraka Dam is a gravity dam on the Mandraka River near Mandraka in the Analamanga Region of Madagascar. The dam was constructed by a French firm by 1956 and creates Lake Mandraka.[1]The dam supplies water to a 24 megawatts (32,000 hp) hydroelectric power station 1.9 km (1.2 mi) to the east, down in the valley. The change in elevation between the dam and power station affords a hydraulic head on 226 metres (741 ft).[2][3] The dam and power station are operated and owned by Jirama and the four 6 megawatts (8,000 hp) Pelton turbine-generators were commissioned between 1958 and 1972.[4]"

Love Songs Ain't for Us;""Love Songs Ain't for Us" is a song recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Amy Shark, featuring Keith Urban. The song was released on 19 February 2021[1] as the fourth single from Shark's second studio album, Cry Forever.Shark recalls saying "Just before we started the writing session, Ed [Sheeran] asked me if I wrote songs about my man, I told him I do, but love songs aren't really for us. He then smiled and said 'ok that's what we'll do then'. I don't know why but I struggle to write straight forward love songs, the second they start sounding too lovey and gushy I tend to follow it up with a lyric that's semi sad or confronting. This song is as loved up as you'll get from me and I love it."[2]Speaking to Rolling Stone Australia, Shark explained that working with another artist is something which needs to feel "right" and "natural". Shark said "This particular song that he's on, it felt like it needed something, and when someone threw Keith Urban's name in, I was like, 'Oh my god, that's genius, and it's perfect!'... Once we sent it to him, he was just so stoked and more than happy to be involved, and just took the song to another level."[3]  "The song is so classy and timeless I needed to find a class act to join me. Keith is so professional and well respected around the world, so it was a no brainer".[4]At the 2021 ARIA Music Awards, the song was nominated for Song of the Year and the James Chappel directed video for Best Video.[5]At the APRA Music Awards of 2022, the song won Most Performed Country Work.[6][7]The music video for "Love Songs Ain't for Us" was directed by James Chappel and produced by Yiani Andrikidis. It premiered on 19 February 2021.[8]Women in Pop called the song "A gorgeous, tender ballad with country vibes... [which] showcases Shark's remarkable, emotive voice with little more than a gentle guitar and piano backing up her".[2]Tyler Jenke from Rolling Stone Australia described the song as "A smooth pop track which, while not full of the same outwardly anthemic qualities as previous tracks, revels in the quiet intensity, utilising the sort of country influences only someone like Keith Urban can add to the mix."[3]Laura English from Music Feeds said "The song is light on production and gentle with the instrumentals it introduces. It's carried by Shark and Urban's voices in a really lovely way."[9] Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone."
Pusher centrifuge;"A pusher centrifuge is a type of filtration technique that offers continuous operation to de-water and wash materials such as relatively in-compressible feed solids, free-draining crystalline, polymers and fibrous substances. It consists of a constant speed rotor and is fixed to one of several baskets. This assembly is applied with centrifugal force that is generated mechanically for smaller units and hydraulically for larger units to enable separation.Pusher centrifuges can be used for a variety of applications. They were typically used in inorganic industries and later, extensively in chemical industries such as organic intermediates, plastics, food processing and rocket fuels.A suspension feed enters the process to undergo pre-acceleration and distribution. The subsequent processes involve main filtration and intermediate de-watering, after which the main filtrate is collected. Wash liquid enters the washing step and final de-watering follows. Wash filtrate is extracted from these two stages. The final step involves discharge of solids which are then collected as the finished product. These process steps take place simultaneously in different parts of the centrifuge.It is widely accepted due to its ease of modification, such as gas-tight and explosion protection configurations.Pusher centrifuges are mainly used in chemical, pharmaceutical, food (mainly to produce sodium chloride as common salt) and mineral industries. During the twentieth century, the pusher centrifuge was used for desiccation of comparatively large crystals and solids.[1]Although pushers are typically used for inorganic products, they appear in chemical industries such as organic intermediates, plastics, food processing and rocket fuels. Organic intermediates include paraxylene, adipic acid, oxalic acid caprolactam, nitrocellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, etc.In food processing, pusher centrifugation is used to produce monosodium glutamate, salt, lysine and saccharin.[2]Pusher centrifugation is also used in the plastic industry, contributing to products such as PVC, polyethylene and polypropylene, and a number of other resins.Individual productsThe designs for pusher centrifuge are as follows:Pushers come with eithermechanical and/or hydraulic drive units. Speed can vary.Single-stage units can be cylindrical or cylindrical/conical with a single long basket and screenMultistage (two-, three-, or four- stage designs): cylindrical and cylindrical/conicalFeed distributor design: conical/cylindrical or plateThe important parameters are screen area, acceleration level in the final drainage zone and cake thickness. Cake filtration affects residence time and volumetric throughput. Residence on the screen is controlled by the screen's length and diameter, cake thickness and the frequency and stroke length of the cake.[3]Pushers utilise the cake layer to act as a filter, hence the feed normally contains high solid concentration containing fast draining, crystalline, granular or fibrous solids. The solid concentration ranges from 25-65 wt%.[2] The mean particle size suitable for pushers must be at least 150 µm. The capacity depends on the basket diameter and ranges from 1 ton/h to 120tons/h.[4]The cake is under centrifugal force. It becomes drier as it progresses in the basket and is discharged from the pusher basket into the solid discharge housing (pusher centrifuge operation). The stroke length ranges from 30 to 80 mm and the stroke frequency is between 45 and 90strokes/min.[4]The push efficiency is defined as the distance of the forward movement of the cake ring divided by the stroke length. The push efficiency is a function of the solid volumetric loading, which results in self-compensating control of varying rates. Up to 90% push efficiency is achievable depending on the cake properties.[4] dQ3ET42TThe equation for the filtration rate, Q:[4]Where μ{\displaystyle \mu } and ρ{\displaystyle \rho } are viscosity and liquid density, respectively. Ω{\displaystyle \Omega } is the angular speed, K{\displaystyle K} is the average cake permeability, which is related to equation (2), rp,rc{\displaystyle r_{p},r_{c}}, and rb{\displaystyle r_{b}} are the radius of the liquid surface, cake surface and filter medium adjacent to the perforated bowl respectively, Rm{\displaystyle R_{m}} is the combined resistance, α{\displaystyle \alpha } is the specific resistance and ρs{\displaystyle \rho s} is the solid density.The numerator describes the pusher's driving force, which is due to the hydrostatic pressure difference across the wall and the liquid surface. The denominator describes the resistance due to the cake layer and the filter medium.Performance is a function of many parameters, including particle size, viscosity, solid concentration and cake quality.[2]To create the cake layer, the particle size has to be as large as practically possible. Larger particle size increases the porosity of the cake layer and allows feed liquid to pass through. Particle shape is equally important, because it determines the surface area per unit mass. As it decreases, less surface area is available to bind moisture, providing a drier cake.[2]Filtration rate is a function of the viscosity of the feed fluid. From equation (1), the relationship of the filtration rate is inversely proportional to the viscosity. Increasing viscosity means adding resistance to the fluid flow, which complicates separation of the fluids from the slurry. Consequently, the throughput of the pusher is de-rated.[2][4]In most cases the solids discharge capacity/hydraulic capacity is not the limiting factor. The usual limitation is the filtration rate. Therefore, more solids can be processed by increasing the feed slurry concentration.The cake quality is determined by the purity and the amount of volatile matter.Wash liquid is introduced on the cake in order to displace the mother liquor along with the impurities.[2] The cake wash ratio is normally between 0.1 and 0.3 kg wash/kg solids, which displace at least 95% of the feed fluid and impurities within the wash zone's normal residence time.[4]The amount of volatile matter present in the discharge is a function of the centrifugal force (G) and the residence time at that force. Separation increases with G and hence favours the filtration rate as illustrated in equation (3).[4]where G{\displaystyle G} is the centrifugal force, Ω{\displaystyle \Omega } is the angular speed, r{\displaystyle r} is the radius of the basket, and g{\displaystyle g} is the gravitational force.By relating equation 3 to equation 1, the relationship of the centrifugal force is shown to be proportional to the filtration rate. As pushers often deal with fragile crystals, the movement of the pusher plate and acceleration in the feed funnel matter, because they can break some of the particles.[4] In addition to the movement plate, G can cause breakage and compaction, and volatile matter in the cake increases. The gentle movement of cake in low G, single stage, long basket designs results in low particle attrition. As more solids pass through, residence time decreases, which increases volatile matter in the discharge cake.[2]The heuristics of pusher centrifuge design consider equipment size, operation sequence and recycle structure.Overall approach:[4]Variables considered in sizing equipment:Equipment selection is based upon test results, references from similar processes and experience and considered in terms of:For conical and cylindrical designs and assembly, the cone slant angle should not exceed sliding friction cake angle. Otherwise it would result in high vibration and poor performance.[4]In order to optimise capacity and performance, it is desirable to pre-concentrate the feed slurry as much as possible. Some designs have a short conical section at the feed end for thickening within the unit, but generally it is preferable to thicken before entering the centrifuge with gravity settlers, hydrocyclones or inclined screens, producing a higher concentration of solids.The volumetric throughput for multistage designs can be increased by increasing the forced cake height while still retaining acceptable push efficiency.Selection of designs is usually done by scale-up from lab tests. Test data analysis should be rationalised in preparation for equipment scale-up. Computer-aided design software can assist in design and scale-up. Pilot-testing and rollout then follows.[5]The majority of liquid contained within the mixture is drawn out at an early stage, in the feed zone of the slot screen. It is discharged into the filtrate housing. After formation of solid cakes, the main by-product produced is water, which may be used in all sorts of industrial usage. Filtration cakes are washed using nozzles or waste baskets.Post-treatment processes are a function of the specifics of the waste stream and are diverse.[6]Design advances have enhanced performance and broaden the application range. These include additional stages, push hesitation, horizontal split process housing, integrated hydraulics, seals, pre-drained funnels and an integrated thickening function.B&P Process Equipment and Systems (B&P) makes the largest single-stage pusher centrifuge, which they claimed to be superior to multistage designs.[7] They claimed that additional impurities enter the liquid housing due to additional particles tumbling in each stage. The problem can be overcome by using a shorter inner basket with smaller diameter between the pusher plates and the basket and enabling pusher movement to take place between the pusher plate and the basket as well as between the inner basket and the outer basket. Compared to single-stage pushers that have pusher movement only between pusher plate and basket, multistage centrifuges have the advantages that the cake height is reduced, filtration resistance is lower and lesser force is required.Push hesitation holds the pusher plate in the back stroke, allowing the cake to build on itself. The cake acts as the filtering media that can even capture finer solids. This reduces the loss of solids passing through the wedge slots. Although this modification reduces capacity, it has helped improved the solid capture efficiency and make pusher centrifuges applicable to smaller particles.[2]This allows the removal of the rotating assembly without disassembling the basket and pusher centrifuge from the shafting assembly.An automated mechanism allows the system to operate independently.Shaft seals eliminate the possibility of cross-contamination between the hydraulic and process ends. Options include a centrifugal liquid ring seal and a non-contacting inert gas purged labyrinth seal that eliminates leakage.The pre-drained funnel removes a portion of the feed fluid through a puncture surface. This feature helps to concentrate the feed, which is especially important for drainage-limited applications. However the funnel cannot be back-washed therefore this feature is only available for crystals that tend not to back-crystallise.Integrating the thickening function enables the pusher to be loaded with mixture with as little as 30-35% wt of solid. It also reduces process costs of solid-liquid separation by as much as 20%.[8]"

Joseph Sledge;"Joseph Sledge Jr. (1942 – 1 December, 2020)[1] was an American man who was wrongly convicted of the murders of two women, Josephine and Aileen Davis, for which he was imprisoned for over 36 years before being exonerated by new DNA evidence. His case represents the longest duration of incarceration for a case that has been overturned by DNA evidence, and he was the longest-serving inmate to have been exonerated in North Carolina.[2]On September 6, 1976, two women were found dead in Elizabethtown, North Carolina. Both had multiple stab wounds and other injuries indicating a violent struggle.[3][4]Joseph Sledge, Jr., then 34 years old, who had recently escaped from minimum-security White Lake Prison Camp on September 5, was suspected by police, who issued a warrant for his arrest. Sledge was spotted on September 7 driving a stolen '69 Chevrolet in Fayetteville but eventually escaped on foot after an extended car chase. The next day he was arrested in Dillion and brought in for questioning. Sledge had been serving a 4-year sentence for misdemeanour larceny and claimed to have jumped the fence to escape the prison camp due to beatings and threats against his life. He led police to where he had escaped and showed them his escape route to where he had stolen the car. Sledge was sent back to prison. The police interviewed other prisoners who Sledge subsequently spent time in prison with following the murders, and in February, 1978 he was formally charged after two inmates, Herman Baker and Donnie Sutton, claimed that he had confessed to the crimes while in prison.During the trial in May the same year, Sledge denied that he had committed the crimes, and after two days of deliberation, the trial resulted in a hung jury. Sledge was set on trial again in August, 1978, however, this time the jury convicted him of second-degree murder and he received two back-to-back life sentences.He appealed to the North Carolina Supreme Court the next year, but his efforts failed to acquit him of the crime.[3][4]Sledge continued to file post-conviction motions from prison, declining help from a lawyer. He eventually filed over 25 of these from prison over the length of his incarceration, one of which was a sworn statement by a former inmate of Herman Baker, who claimed that Baker had admitted to having lied under oath as a result of police coercion and promised favors. However, none of these motions succeeded in bringing about an investigation into his exoneration. In 2003, Sledge requested that DNA testing be conducted on the hairs and other evidence found from the case, however, some of the evidence had gone missing, and it was not until 2012 that the evidence surfaced and was tested. Mitochondrial DNA testing of pubic hair evidence did not match Sledge.In 2013 Baker came forward and he recanted his story, saying that his testimony had been false and that he and Sutton had lied about receiving special treatment and a share of the $5000 reward which the Governor's Office had offered in return for information leading to arrest and conviction. He admitted that he was promised early parole and $3000, which he received. Additionally, Baker claimed that police had described the scene to him so that his testimony would be believable.[5][6] Sutton was deceased by this time, but records show that he also received early parole and a reward of $2,000. The North Carolina Center on Actual Innocence, who helped to investigate the case, also learned that the prosecution had not shown to the jury key evidence that put Sledge's guilt in doubt. For instance, in initial interviews with Sutton, he had denied that Sledge had admitted the crime and only later changed his story. They also discovered that during the case the prosecution had also failed to tell the jury that there was a second suspect who lived 500 yards away, where a shoe print was found that resembled the bloody prints found at the Davis house where the two women were killed.[3][4]On January 25, 2015, Sledge was declared 'factually innocent' by a panel of three North Carolina Superior Court Judges, and was released. He had been in prison for the crime for over 36 years, making Sledge the longest serving inmate exonerated by DNA evidence, and the longest serving inmate exonerated in North Carolina.[7] The decision was made that Sledge would receive $750,000 in recompense for wrongful incarceration. The current District Attorney of Bladen County, although he was not the prosecutor at the time of the original trials, apologised to Sledge, saying “There's nothing worse for a prosecutor than convicting an innocent person.” He also stated that the case would be re-opened to find the real killer.[3][4][8]Christine Mumma, the director of the North Carolina Center on Actual Innocence, was accused of inappropriate professional conduct in the case after she took a water bottle from the home of Marie Andrus and had DNA tests performed without her permission. Mumma received an official admonition, the lowest form of warning available to the disciplinary panel. The evidence came back inconclusive and was not used to exonerate Sledge. [9]Joseph Sledge is the eighth inmate to be freed based on the investigations of the North Carolina Center on Actual Innocence.[8]Days before his eventual exoneration, Caroline Brown, granddaughter of victim Josephine Davis, expressed her disgust with the possibility of his impending release, still believing him to be guilty.[10]In an interview after he was released, Sledge stated: My personal opinion is that they made me the scapegoat because they had no one to blame. And being that I had been an escapee from the prison unit when these two ladies were killed, they kind of fixed it in a manner to make me look like the perpetrator.He also expressed his opinion that the practice of using hair analysis as evidence of guilt in a crime should be abolished.[11]Sledge later sued those who prosecuted his case, blaming nine people, as well as Columbus County Clerk of Court, the Bladen County Sheriff’s Office and the State Bureau of Investigation for with holding or failing to find DNA evidence that would have exonerated him much earlier.[12][13] The Bladen County sheriff’s office eventually settled the suit against them, paying Sledge $4 million.[14][15] Additional lawsuits continue against the State of North Carolina for the actions of the SBI and Clerk's Office, whom Sledge alleges ignored his pleas for DNA testing.[16][17]"

Kameo;"Kameo: Elements of Power is a 2005 action-adventure video game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The player controls Kameo, a 16-year-old elf, who must travel across the land, rescuing her family while collecting Elemental Sprites and Warriors in a Beat 'Em Up style combat against the trolls that stand in her way. Kameo's ten elemental powers let her transform into creatures and use their varied abilities to solve combat-oriented puzzles and progress through the game's levels.Kameo is known for its prolonged development cycle, which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing and nurturing monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more befitting of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was repurposed from a fairy to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly finished for the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used the extra time to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, and add a local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.The game received generally favorable reviews and sales estimates ranged from subpar to par. Reviewers praised Kameo's graphics as setting standards for the new console, and noted its vivid color palette. Their criticism focused on the gameplay, in particular its repetition, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and overbearing tutorial. Reviewers found the story and Kameo's character lackluster, but largely liked the other characters and the core morphing concept. They had high praise for the orchestral score and other technical features, apart from the game's camera. Rare released several cosmetic downloadable content packs, and a free online cooperative mode upgrade.Retrospective reviews remembered the game for its bright and impressive graphics. Kameo was included in Rare Replay, an August 2015 compilation of 30 Rare titles for the Xbox One, alongside documentary-style videos about the game's development and its planned sequel. The sequel was canceled after a few months of production due to both poor sales of the original and Microsoft's new focus on games for its Kinect peripheral.In the third-person action-adventure game Kameo (pronounced "cameo"[2]), the player controls the titular character, an elf who sabotages her sister before her coronation to take the crown and the Elemental Powers that come with it. This causes her sister Kalus to free the troll King Thorn and form an alliance to take back her crown and the remaining elemental sprites. Kameo uses elemental powers to transform into creatures with different abilities, which she switches between to solve puzzles and advance through the in-game world.[3][4] The player controls the player-character with the left analog stick, the game's camera view with the right thumbstick, and the character attacks and abilities with the controller's triggers. The Xbox 360 controller's face buttons swap between three active, elemental powers.[4]These ten "elemental warriors"[5] include a fire-breathing creature who lights torches, a gorilla who climbs walls and throws foes, and a plant who punches opponents.[4] There are two each of five element types (fire, ice, plant, rock, water).[6] Some enemies have specific weaknesses and can only be affected by specific elemental powers or hazards in the environment.[7] The game is structured such that new character abilities unlock just as their benefits are needed to solve a puzzle.[4] Thus the game's puzzles depend on combat more than logic.[5]  Each of the elemental forms has several ability upgrades,[8] which the player can redeem by collecting and delivering fruit to a sacred tome called the Wotnot book.[4] The Kameo character, herself, can move faster than the elemental warriors but has no special ability apart from breaking crates.[7]The game begins as Kameo advances through a castle—with the help of three elemental powers—to rescue her family. As the tutorial prologue ends, Kameo loses her elemental powers and is ejected from the castle into the Enchanted Kingdom to grow stronger and try again. Kameo travels through four themed worlds (water, ice, fire, and swamp) at the outskirts of the Badlands, the overworld that connects the areas. Each of the worlds are interspersed with townsfolk[3] and combat-oriented puzzles.[5] Kameo can either travel to the worlds through the Badlands, where the elves and trolls skirmish, or warp from the Enchanted Kingdom.[3] A help system built into the game provides hints or direct solutions for struggling players.[7] Throughout the kingdom, Kameo finds and defeats the seven shadow creatures each guarding one of her elemental powers, while saving her family earning the other 3.[4]The player can slow time by landing successive hits and kills on enemies to fill an on-screen meter.[7] The player can return to levels to attempt a higher score.[7] The game's action sequences, more than half of the game, require the player to defeat groups of enemies before proceeding to the next room, and ultimately leading to a boss battle.[5] Kameo has a two-player, split-screen cooperative gameplay mode in which players can fight alongside each other during the action scenes.[5] Rare added support for online cooperative play (via Xbox Live or System Link) as a downloadable patch following the game's release.[9]Rare's protracted development of Kameo spanned four consoles: Nintendo's Nintendo 64[10] and GameCube, Microsoft's Xbox, and ultimately, the Xbox 360.[11] The game became known for its long development cycle[3][5]—IGN wrote that the game had received more IGN editor coverage during its development than "almost any other single game".[3] In the final game, a recipe can found that reads "Take one Cube of ice… Add two beetles from a Box of Creepy Crawlies… Heat to 360 degrees…" which alludes to the development cycles on each console.[12] Shortly after Rare finished work on Donkey Kong 64,[10] Kameo began as a game in which the player catches and evolves creatures. In lead designer George Andreas's concept, the creatures would follow the player and act of their own volition.[13] This version had a "Nintendo feel" and Pokémon-like concept: the player nursed little monsters into adults. Kameo spent several years in development for the GameCube[11] and Rare shared an early version of the game at Electronic Entertainment Expo, an annual video game conference.[10] In the meantime, Microsoft acquired Rare in September 2002 for a record price of $377 million.[14][15] Kameo lost many of its Pokémon elements when development transferred to the Microsoft's Xbox.[11] Rare's Phil Tossell liked the Pokémon-style concept but ultimately felt that the platform change was a positive move for the game.[11]The team distilled the original concept into the core gameplay mechanics that players preferred, namely the abilities to morph into characters and to fight. In what became the core gameplay, the player would use a combination of Kameo's elemental warriors to progress through levels. Rare later expanded the concept to that of an adventure game, though its story was secondary to the gameplay. Kameo was designed for fluidity—the team tried to minimize player chores and player waiting times.[13] The team simplified the set of characters from a hundred to a dozen, and expanded the skill sets of those remaining. Tossell designed these characters, and started with a boulder-like animal. These creature designs later became Kameo's morphing forms. As the game transitioned and Rare attempted to distance itself from its mawkish reputation for "cute characters with big eyes", the team struggled to repurpose Kameo into an elf from the fairy of the original concept. Tossell felt that this task was impossible, as Microsoft simultaneously wanted to widen its base while it did not give Rare the room to grow out of its cutesy design.[11] The Kameo character transitioned through a "tribal" look before becoming an elf, and her own attacks were ultimately repurposed into the elemental warriors'.[13] Kameo became an Xbox 360 launch title (alongside Rare's Perfect Dark Zero) and received a graphics upgrade in the process.[11] The game had been about 80% complete for the original Xbox, but the transition freed the game's vision from technical constraints.[13]With their timeframe extended, the development team added extra attacks for the ten characters, day–night transition interactions, in-game scores and leaderboards, a cooperative multiplayer splitscreen mode, and a post-release update that extends the cooperative mode over online and local network.[2] The team revisited level ideas that did not fit on the previous console, and transitioned from synthesized music and a text-based story to an orchestral soundtrack and voice acting. The cooperative mode was also added retroactively, which challenged the already finalized level design.[13] The most pronounced improvements were in the game's graphics and upgrades.[2] Levels on the Xbox 360 could hold thousands of characters on-screen at once. The team playtested the feel of each elemental warrior and spent extra time refining the gradual difficulty increase in the opening level.[2] In reflection, the project's biggest influences were ultimately Nintendo, Pokémon, and Resident Evil.[10]Around the time of Kameo's release, lead designer George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He said that there were enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested.[2] Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss.[16] Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over.[17] Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.[16]Rare and Microsoft Studios released Kameo alongside the Xbox 360 console as a launch title:[3] on November 22, 2005, in North America,[1] and December 2 in Europe.[18] The game was available for purchase in retail stores ahead of the console's launch date.[19][20] At release, it was sold at a lower price than other Xbox 360 games.[21] In advance of its February 2, 2006, Japanese release, Microsoft Japan held a Kameo promotional press event with celebrities Yoshinari Tsuji [jp] and Kaori Manabe in late January 2006. 1UP.com reported the event as "subdued" but appropriate for Japanese games journalists to test Kameo, as the Xbox 360 had been selling poorly in the region.[22]Steve Burke served as the audio lead on the Kameo project, his first at Rare, for which he composed its soundtrack and contributed to its sound effects and voiceovers. As the game was originally planned for the GameCube, the first few months of development appeared to have no support for audio above the MIDI sample-style compositions characteristic of Nintendo's previous console, the Nintendo 64. The game's first demo at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo used this type of audio. Of the first pieces he wrote for this project in the early months of 2001, some were scrapped. Others were re-recorded as streaming audio, which plays pre-recorded audio files, when the developers added support. It became Rare's first orchestral soundtrack. Other Rare staff members contributed their talents to the recording process, such as trumpet and voice recordings.[23]Burke experimented with a variety of musical styles throughout the game's development. Burke's original compositions were lighthearted as befitting for a Nintendo game, but became darker along with other parts of the game to match the Xbox audience when Microsoft acquired Rare. The composer thought that this transition was reflected in the soundtrack, with some Nintendo-style music juxtaposed against the roaring orchestral tracks. Burke estimates that he had written four hours of audio for the project and ultimately recorded 80 minutes with an orchestra and choir over four days in Prague. The team recorded the orchestra and choir separately. Sumthing Else Music Works published the soundtrack on compact disc and for download via the iTunes Store and Amazon. It was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition award.[23]A year prior to Kameo's release, GamesRadar wrote that while they highly anticipated the title and expected it to be of high quality, they thought the game's continual delays would likely hurt the final product.[24] Closer to release, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) added that he had expected the game to be the best among the Xbox 360 launch titles. Kameo's core gameplay concept brought his anticipation to par with that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, and he thought the game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals.[4] Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.[2]The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic.[25] Market research company NPD Group reported that Kameo sold 300,000 copies[21] while Retro Gamer reported that the game sold over 700,000 copies.[11] GameSpot described the NPD Group figures as significantly below expectations and the sales of Rare's other Xbox 360 launch title, Perfect Dark Zero.[30] Retro Gamer described its figures as "respectable ... for a new franchise".[11] Rare senior software engineer Nick Burton said that while Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero had reputations for poor sales, the two games "sold phenomenally well" for launch titles. Kameo continued to sell three years after its release.[31]Reviewers praised the game's graphics as setting standards for the new console.[4][5][8][32] David Clayman (IGN) saw Kameo as a good demonstration of the Xbox 360's graphical possibilities,[8] and Bramwell (Eurogamer) considered the degree of detail, even at long distances and in processor-intensive scenes, "unprecedented in a console game".[4] Though he had few points of reference for the new console, Clayman (IGN) wrote that the extremely detailed high-definition graphics appeared worthy of the Xbox 360's "next generation" moniker.[8] When paired with surround sound, the experience was "almost overwhelming".[8] Reviewers also noted the game's vivid color palette.[4][5][26] Kasavin (GameSpot) wrote that the developers balanced the visual elements to appeal to children and adults alike.[5] Andrew Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that the game looked marvelous but was sometimes distracted by too much occurring onscreen.[26]Critics praised the core morphing concept[4][5] but criticized its repetitive gameplay,[4][5][26][33][34] awkward controls,[4][32][33] easy combat,[5][7] disorganized introduction,[4][5] and overemphasis on tutorial.[4][5][7][32] Bramwell (Eurogamer) wrote that though the fundamental idea was good, the repetitious combinations of elemental attacks were rarely novel and often laborious. The excitement of realizing a puzzle's solution, Bramwell said, was often ruined by the player's struggle to perform the task correctly. He wrote that the game's design constrained players and "bred apathy". For example, tutorials followed the scenes in which they would have been useful, cutscenes left no puzzle solution to imagination, puzzle solutions were rarely revisited after their first use, and character dialogue overstated the importance of simple puzzles. Bramwell was "desperate" for the freedom to experiment without forced guidance. "The game", he wrote, "hardly ever stops telling you what to do."[4] Clayman (IGN) agreed that there was too much help[7] but alternatively appreciated the continual challenge and activity density of Kameo's level design, with townspeople interspersed within the level's action. He also liked to experiment in the Badlands as a break from the puzzles.[3] Clayman found the game's combat easy but fun. He especially enjoyed the slowed time combat.[7] Bramwell (Eurogamer) said that the "relative pleasure" of Kameo's combat was ultimately worth little, as the player could use basic attacks and avoid most major upgrades throughout the whole game.[4] Phil Theobald (GameSpy) added that character upgrades were required for maintaining interest in the gameplay, but that the game does not incentivize finding such combinations.[33] Pfister (1UP.com) too found the gameplay balance and puzzle design insipid.[26]Reviewers found the story[8][26][34] and Kameo's character lackluster,[5][8] but largely liked the other characters.[6][7][28] Andrew Reiner (Game Informer) said that the story tracked through every imaginable video game cliché and failed to build emotional attachment.[34] Clayman (IGN) noted that he spent little time as Kameo, the character. He found the elemental warriors more useful, interesting, and original, and felt that the ten powers were balanced so as to make each worth playing.[7] Dave Halverson agreed that the multiple character options represent a rare breadth of player choice,[28] while Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that only a few of the characters had abilities worth regularly using and called the "terrible" character design typical for the developer.[26] Clayman (IGN) thought that Kameo's character was comparatively less interesting than that of the rest of the cast.[8] Kasavin (GameSpot) agreed that Kameo visually appeared "generic" while other characters and environments had exceptional and inspired style.[5] Alternatively, Halverson (Play) thought of the "breathtaking female lead" as the "quintessential fantasy icon".[28]Reviewers made positive remarks about the game's orchestral score and voice acting.[5][8][23] Kasavin (GameSpot) wrote that added choral tracks during intense in-game moments gave the game epic overtones,[5] though Clayman (IGN) thought the score made the game environments feel delusively majestic.[8] Bramwell (Eurogamer) found little joy in the verbose dialogue, which he often skipped even during important scenes,[4] but Kasavin (GameSpot) considered the voice acting amusing, with good quality. He also praised the level of nuance in the sound effects, such as those made as characters walked.[5]Clayman (IGN) reported that the game had no major technical issues, which was a major concern in the protracted run-up to the game's release.[3] He also found that most of its levels did not appear to leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics.[8] Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls and camera throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see.[4] Theobald (GameSpy) also lamented the camera.[33] Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be technically outstanding, and praised its automatic game save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed display on both standard- and high-definition televisions.[5] Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was technically impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.[26]Critics noted the game's length as shorter than expected, with about ten hours of content.[5][7][26] Clayman (IGN) had little desire to replay the solved puzzles[8] and Bramwell (Eurogamer) was even eager for the game to end.[4] Halverson (Play) planned to return to the game but wrote that he would have preferred five more hours of the single-player over the Xbox Live features.[28] Reviewers were largely unimpressed with the extra Xbox Live cooperative play[5][28][33] and score attack features.[8][28] Halverson (Play) had hopes for Kameo and Psychonauts to rekindle developer interest in the 3D platforming genre, but concluded that such games were likely not to return.[28] Clayman (IGN) did not find the game to live up to its publicity as a competitor against The Legend of Zelda series,[8] though Theobald (GameSpy) thought Kameo's boss battles were comparable.[33] Pfister (1UP.com) noted several traditional Rare flourishes—lots of color and graphics effects, puns for character names—but ultimately wrote that Kameo was proof that Microsoft had received "exactly what they paid for" in its acquisition of Rare.[26] Theobald (GameSpy) said that Rare had avoided its usual tropes of making players collect many items and poor character design, and made a "worthy" launch title.[6] Nigel Kendall (The Times) wrote that the game was "more cerebral" than the console's other games, which were stereotypically about driving, football, or shooting.[29] Kasavin (GameSpot) noted that Kameo was the most accessible launch title to players of all ages. In summary, he thought the game was a suitable fit for players' first experiences on the new Xbox 360.[5]The game was released without online support for co-operative play, but Rare promised to add the feature as a free patch and did so in April 2006.[9] The patch let two players play the story simultaneously when their consoles were connected through Xbox Live or System Link.[35] It also added new achievements.[36] For a fee, players could download a series of costume packs that change the visual appearance of the game's characters.[9] In September 2006, Rare released the Kameo "Power Pack", which added leaderboards, a costume pack, new achievements, and three new modes of gameplay: Expert, Time Attack, and Rune Battle.[37] Expert Mode remasters six of the game's levels with added difficulty. Time Attack Mode lets two co-op players (local or online) attempt to finish levels as fast as possible. Rune Battle Mode pits two co-op players against each other to collect the most rune items. Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica wrote that Rare "did a good job" of supporting Kameo with post-release content. He liked the idea of the time-based mode and thought that the Expert mode would allay criticism of the game's easiness.[36]In retrospect, Kotaku wrote that Kameo would be remembered as "that pretty Xbox 360 launch game",[38] which IGN confirmed a year after its release.[39] While some games journalists reported unfavorable views towards Kameo, they also reported its fanbase to be dedicated.[17][36][40] Other games journalists described the game as underrated.[41][42] Kameo was among the first batch of games to be sold digitally with the Xbox 360's Games on Demand service in August 2009.[43]Kameo was later included in Rare Replay, a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released for the Xbox One in August 2015.[44] The game runs through the Xbox One's backward compatibility, which emulates select Xbox 360 titles on the newer console.[45] Kameo was among the first batch of games to be supported for the feature.[46] The Rare Replay emulated release includes all original downloadable content for free[47] and lets players migrate their Xbox 360 cloud saves to their Xbox One.[38] Kameo's performance in the Xbox One's emulator slightly improves upon its technical performance on the Xbox 360 itself.[45] Stephen Totilo (Kotaku) was surprised at his positive response to replaying Kameo on Rare Replay, having found the introductory stage off-putting when he sampled it at the Xbox 360's launch. He planned to return to the title.[38] Chris Carter (Destructoid) wrote that while Kameo was not worth full price at its release, it was a welcome addition worth playing in the compilation.[48] In June 2019, the game was enhanced to run at native 4K resolution on Xbox One X.[49]A sequel to Kameo was in production but was ultimately canceled.[11] George Andreas began work on the sequel after finishing the first game.[50] Kameo 2 was designed to be a darker take on the original. Rare redesigned Kameo to have smaller eyes and matured the other creatures.[11] For instance, the trolls were given steampunk designs.[51] The sequel put a heavier emphasis on the open world, as the team was influenced by Assassin's Creed (2007). Rare began to use Havok physics software for smoother inverse kinematics animations,[50] and planned to incorporate assets from an unreleased game, Black Widow, which featured a giant, mechanical spider.[52] For creature upgrades, the team planned to let Kameo fly as an eagle so the player could experience the grandeur of a bird's-eye view.[11] Kameo composer Steve Burke said that he worked on the sequel for a year. He wrote several new audio tracks in a Celtic style and recorded voiceovers, which together were used in a concept demo pitched to Microsoft.[23] The project was canceled after about three months of production as Rare re-focused on Microsoft's Kinect effort.[11] At the time, Microsoft redirected its internal studios to support the project.[30] The original's lackluster sales also contributed to the cancelation.[30][53] The public had heard reports of its cancelation during the 2009 restructure and had seen an artwork leak in 2011, but the cancellation was not confirmed until Microsoft Studios vice president Phil Spencer did so in 2013.[21] 1UP.com questioned whether Kameo needed a sequel at all.[53] Rare released a retrospective documentary of the unreleased game as part of its August 2015 Rare Replay collection.[51] Kameo 2 concept artist Peter Hentze narrated the documentary, which focuses on art that would have been included in the game[54] apart from a brief video clip.[55] Rare later released a follow-up making-of Kameo video in March 2016.[10] The sequel's video did not elaborate on why Microsoft canceled the project.[51]"
MTV Unplugged (Shakira album);"MTV Unplugged is the first live album by Colombian singer and songwriter Shakira, released on 29 February 2000, by Columbia Records and Sony Latin. It was recorded on 12 August 1999, during her MTV Unplugged performance at the Grand Ballroom in New York City.The performance was released in 2000 as a live album, and again in 2002 as a DVD. It was critically acclaimed by American critics and earned Shakira her first Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album.The Unplugged concert was the program's first episode to be broadcast entirely in Spanish and served as her major breakthrough in the U.S. market.[2] The concert is noted to be the "first time a Latin pop act attempted an Unplugged, the first Latina solo act to do so, and the first time a Latino act didn’t tape their performance at MTV’s studios in Miami."[3]The concert has received critical acclaim, and is included on lists of best unplugged performances. The performance is listed on Vulture Magazine’s “7 Really Good MTV Unplugged Performances” list.[4] Nylon (magazine) has included “Sombra De Ti” on the list “10 Of The Best ‘MTV Unplugged’ Performances.”[5] Yardbarker ranked the album at number 3 on their list of“20 greatest MTV 'Unplugged' albums.” .[6] ”Remezcla” includes the performance on “The 10 Most Iconic Latin American ‘MTV Unplugged’ Performances.”[7] MTV Unplugged has sold over 1.3 million units worldwide by June 2001.[8]Bonus features* Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Shipments figures based on certification alone."

Konya Plummer;"Konya Tajae Plummer (born 2 August 1997) is a Jamaican professional footballer who plays as a centre back for the Jamaica national team.[2]Plummer's interest in football started while she was attending kindergarten, where she was exposed to the game by a relative who took her to the park in Annotto Bay to watch the sport. Plummer started playing for Rangers FC at age 11 with a boys' team in St Mary and two years later was captaining that team. Plummer then transferred to Titchfield High School in Portland with the help of vice-president of the Portland Football Association (PFA), Garfield Fuller, where she was able to participate in the Daryl Vaz-sponsored female football league. She represented the school for two years, winning the competition in both seasons. Based on her performance, she was recommended by the PFA to the national program.[3][4] Plummer emigrated to the United States aged 16.[5]Plummer played four seasons of college soccer as a student athlete. Between 2016 and 2017, she played as a forward at Southeastern University where she scored 19 goals and made 16 assists in her 38 appearances for the team.[6] As a freshman she led the team in assists with 10. On 7 October 2017, Plummer scored a career-high four goals in a match against Florida Memorial.[7] Ahead of the 2018 season, Plummer transferred to UCF Knights, making the switch to defender in the process.[8] In the 2019 season, Plummer was named AAC Defensive Player of the Year, having started 16 of 17 matches and only allowing seven goals, and was selected to the AAC First Team.[9][10]On 16 January 2020, Plummer was selected by Orlando Pride in the second round (10th overall) of the 2020 NWSL College Draft. She became the first Jamaica-born player drafted in NWSL history.[11][12] Plummer signed a two-year contract with the team on 3 March.[13] Plummer made her professional debut on 11 October versus Houston Dash.[14] She appeared in two Fall Series matches in total for a combined 70 minutes.[15]On 17 August 2021, Plummer was loaned to Swedish Damallsvenskan club AIK for the remainder of 2021 Damallsvenskan season.[16] She made six appearances, all as a starter, helping keep three shutouts as AIK finished 10th.On 8 December 2021, Plummer had her Orlando Pride contract option declined and was released to the waiver wire.[17]In 2018, Plummer competed in 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship with Jamaica women's national team.Plummer captained the Reggae Girlz at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France. It was the first time a Caribbean nation had qualified for the women's tournament.[18] She played every minute for Jamaica as the team was eliminated at the Group Stage after losing all three games against Brazil, Italy and Australia.In July 2022, Plummer took to social media to announce she was pregnant.[19]Scores and results list Jamaica's goal tally first"

Rudolf Kolmodin;"Lieutenant General Karl Rudolf Kolmodin (17 January 1896 – 29 August 1978) was a Swedish Coastal Artillery officer. Kolmodin's senior commands include postings as commanding officer of the Gothenburg Coastal Artillery Defence and Stockholm Coastal Artillery Defence and as Inspector of the Swedish Coastal Artillery.Kolmodin was born on 17 January 1896 in Bromma Parish, Stockholm, Sweden,[1] the son of Professor Adolf Kolmodin (1855–1928) and his wife Nelly (née von Post) (1858–1944).[2] He was the brother of Colonel Gustaf Kolmodin (1893–1975) and Diplomat Johannes Kolmodin (1884–1933). Kolmodin passed studentexamen in Uppsala in 1914.[3]Kolmodin was commissioned as an officer in the Swedish Coastal Artillery in 1916 with the rank of second lieutenant.[3] He was promoted to lieutenant in 1918.[2] Kolmodin attended the general course of the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College from 1921 to 1922 and the senior course of the Artillery and Engineering College from 1922 to 1924.[4] He served as an Adjutant in the staff of the commanding officer of the Swedish Coastal Artillery from 1925 to 1928 and as a mathematics, physics and artillery teacher at the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College and the Swedish Coast Artillery School (Kustartilleriets skjutskola, KAS) from 1927 to 1937.[4][3] Kolmodin then served in the Artillery Department of the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration from 1928 to 1935. He also served as an expert in the 1930 Defense Commission (1930 års försvarskommission) from 1930 to 1935.[4]Kolmodin was promoted to captain in 1929 and to major in 1936. He was appointed Chief of Staff of the Fortification Staff (Fästningsstaben) at Vaxholm Fortress in 1937 and in 1941 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and first became Air Defence Commander at Karlskrona Fortress.[2] When, during World War II, it was deemed necessary to provide the Swedish west coast with an effective coastal artillery defence, it was Kolmodin, who led the final expansion of this defence and gained command of it.[4] He served as Commandant of Älvsborg Fortress in Gothenburg in 1941. In 1942, Älvsborg Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 4) in Gothenburg was raised and Kolmodin was promoted to colonel and became its first commander. He was at the same time commanding officer of Gothenburg Coastal Artillery Defence. Four year later, Kolmodin became commanding officer of Stockholm Coastal Artillery Defence (Stockholms kustartilleriförsvar, SK) and Defence District Commander of Stockholm Archipelago Defence District (Stockholms skärgårds försvarsområde, Fo 46). In 1953, Kolmodin was promoted to major general and appointed Inspector of the Swedish Coastal Artillery.

Klaus Renft Combo;"The Klaus Renft Combo is a veteran German rock band, formed in Leipzig in what was then East Germany, in 1958. Founded by Klaus Renft [de], the band enjoyed significant success in East Germany until banned by the authorities in 1975. The band was reunited in 1990.The group was very successful, but seen by the Stasi as far too radical. In September 1975, Renft were asked to play for the  Ministry of Culture in order to have their license (a document necessary for any working musician or musical group) renewed. Klaus Renft decided to conceal a cassette recorder behind his guitar to preserve their session. However, the woman in charge of their meeting, Comrade Oelschlägel, informed them that they would not be performing because their music was insulting and libelous, and further told them that they "[didn't] exist anymore." She explained that it was not that they were banned, but that they simply did not exist any longer "as a combo."[1]"
Spec's Music;"Camelot Music(June 4, 1998)Spec's Music was a South Florida-based retail music and video rental chain headquartered in Miami. At its height of popularity, Spec's Music operated 80 stores, including 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) "superstores" in Miami Beach, West Palm Beach, and Sunrise. The company's stores were located in malls, strip centers, and free-standing locations throughout Florida. Four of the company's stores were located in malls in Puerto Rico.[1] As of 2021, the last location closed. It was located in the Plaza Las Americas mall in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.[2]Spec's was incorporated in 1948 by founder Martin Spector. The company's first store was a 1,500-square-foot (140 m2) structure in Coral Gables, Florida, situated on South Dixie Highway on the outskirts of Miami. Inside, the store carried a collection of big-band melodies, recorded on then-standard 78 RPM vinyl discs, and other assorted merchandise.[3]By the 1950s, Spec's expanded their sales line to include Kodak Brownie cameras, Magnavox television sets, washing machines, and refrigerators. By the 1960s, Martin Spector dropped the concept of selling other electronics in favor of selling just music, and with the birth of rock and roll the stores were now finally able to support themselves by selling music alone. Spec's stores became so popular during this time that Spector expanded his chain to both Broward and Palm Beach Counties by 1967.Between 1968 and 1980, Spec's expanded at a rate of two stores per year, all located in South Florida. Many of the stores in the 1980s were given a flashy new wave look to them, a style which can still be recognized in many former Spec's locations that are now occupied by f.y.e. The company went public in 1985 after making $16.6 Million in sales from its then-16 stores.  During this same time, Spec's took advantage of the emerging VHS rental market, and added tape-rental divisions to each store.By the late 1980s, the number of Spec's stores increased from 16 to 42.  In 1988, the company was recognized by Forbes as being one of the nation's 200 best-run small companies.In 1992, two Spec's stores were entirely destroyed by Hurricane Andrew, resulting in more than $1 million in damages for the company, and an estimated operating loss of $160,000.  Also around this time companies like Blockbuster and Musicland began opening outlets in and around Spec's Music's markets, forcing the company to develop new strategies for the future.  Aside from opening a prodigious number of new stores and renovating the majority of its existing stores, the company's executives also planned to focus on music selections they felt were under-served by national competitors. This involved placing a greater emphasis on Latin music, classical music, and merchandise targeted for children. To provide room for a greater emphasis on these items, the company decided to remove many of its lackluster video rental departments. By mid-1993, 12 of the video rental departments had been closed and another eight were scheduled for removal in 1994.Additional changes adopted in 1993 included new fixtures inside the stores that could house a combined stock of compact discs and cassettes, as well as listening "posts," each equipped with two headphones and programmed to play 10 compact discs, with featured titles rotating every several days or weeks. These new additions were showcased in a prototype 7,000-square-foot (650 m2) store that opened in Tallahassee, Florida, in early 1994. A little more than a year later in mid-1995 the company turned to the "superstore" format to try to maintain its leading position in Florida, which was being threatened by increasing competition.In the early 1990s, Spec's opened two new superstores in Coconut Grove and South Beach.  These two-story stores each featured more than 70,000 titles, a cafe, and weekend concerts.  However, despite the hype surrounding the grand opening of these two new stores, Spec's Music was beginning to show signs of anemic financial performance. Sales and earnings were slipping, forced downward by the continuing stiff competition in Florida.  Music sales were down nationwide, and Spec's Music was struggling. By the end of 1995, the company's annual sales stood at $79.6 million, a negligible increase over 1994's total of $78.4, but actual earnings slipped from $2.8 million to a meager $1 million.An attempt was made to restructure the company by hiring a former Burger King executive and closing several of its superstores.  Despite this, on June 4, 1998 it was announced that Spec's would be merged with Camelot Music, then the nation's third-largest music retailer.[4][5][6]  Soon after the merger, Camelot Music was purchased by TransWorld Entertainment,[7][8] thus converting most former Spec's locations to FYE.In early 2013, the last remaining Specs store in South Florida, coincidentally the first store which opened in 1948, closed its doors.[9] The Puerto Rico store located in Plaza Las Américas showed the Spec's Music logo at its entrance but operated as FYE. This location closed in 2021.[10]"
2010 Wisconsin Badgers football team;"The 2010 Wisconsin Badgers football team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Badgers, led by fifth-year head coach Bret Bielema, were members of the Big Ten Conference and played their home games at Camp Randall Stadium. They finished the season 11–2, 7–1 in the Big Ten to be crowned Big Ten co-champions along with Michigan State. Due to being ranked the highest of the three schools in the BCS rankings at the end of the season, the Badgers earned the conference's automatic bid to the Rose Bowl, where they were defeated 21–19 by TCU.A blocked PAT was the difference in a crazy game in Camp Randall Stadium. Both Arizona State and Wisconsin were undefeated heading into this game, Arizona State having beaten a pair of FCS teams and Wisconsin having beaten UNLV and San Jose State. The Badgers managed to overcome a sluggish start and fended off an upset bid by the Sun Devils.Arizona State would be marred by mistakes, committing multiple penalties on offense and defense, and Wisconsin used Arizona State's gaffes to keep themselves in the game. The Sun Devils returned a kick for a touchdown, had a very long runback on a kick to end the half (the returner was tackled inside the one-yard line as time expired), and had a punt return for a touchdown called back due to a pair of illegal blocks. Wisconsin did not commit a single turnover, and that would ultimately help to decide this game.Wisconsin improved to 3–0 on the season, and faces FCS opponent Austin Peay next week. Arizona State, however, falls to 2–1 and will need to win 5 Pac-10 games to become bowl-eligible.Wisconsin broke the all-time record for most points scored with 70, breaking a record from the 1962 season (the Badgers defeated New Mexico State 69–13 that season).In a matchup between undefeated teams in the Big Ten, Michigan State prevailed over the 9th ranked Badgers. Despite 3 Spartan turnovers, the Badgers were unable to come away with a road win, dropping head coach Bret Bielema to 0–2 in Spartan Stadium and 2–2 against Michigan State overall. The Spartans face their rival, the Michigan Wolverines in a crucial road contest next week, while the Badgers face longtime rival Minnesota in the battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe.Wisconsin won a school-record 7th straight game over the rival Golden Gophers, dropping Tim Brewster to 0–4 against Wisconsin and improving Bret Bielema to 5–0 against Minnesota. Wisconsin did not commit a turnover for the 4th game in a row, and had two running backs with over 100 yards rushing (James White and John Clay). Minnesota has now lost 5 straight games after winning their opener against Middle Tennessee State.Wisconsin stunned the top-ranked Buckeyes 31–18, their first upset of a top-ranked team since a 1981 defeat of #1 ranked Michigan. Wisconsin Senior WR David Gilreath returned the opening kick of the game for a touchdown, RB John Clay became the first running back to go over 100 yards rushing against the Buckeyes since Joe McKnight of USC in 2008, and Wisconsin's defense harried Ohio State QB Terrelle Pryor all game long. The Badgers ran up 21 unanswered points in the first half before Devin Barclay of Ohio State answered with a field goal. The Buckeyes managed to get 15 more points (via a pair of Daniel Herron touchdown runs) but the Badgers iced their incredible upset of the Buckeyes with a TD run by James White and a Philip Welch field goal. The win over Ohio State is Bret Bielema's first, he was 0–3 against the Buckeyes in the previous three meetings (2007, 2008, and 2009). The loss dropped Jim Tressel to 4–4 against Wisconsin and snapped a 3-game Buckeye winning streak over the Badgers.11th ranked Wisconsin won a narrow 31–30 contest over the Iowa Hawkeyes. The Hawkeyes went into the half with a 13–10 lead, but the Badgers chipped away at it and took a 24–20 lead. The Hawkeyes managed a touchdown and field goal of their own to take a 30–24 lead in the 4th quarter. However, the Badgers scored the go-ahead touchdown on an 8-yard run by running back Montee Ball. With under a minute remaining, Iowa drove into Wisconsin territory on their final possession, but Iowa RB Adam Robinson was tackled before he could get out of bounds. Unable to stop the clock, Iowa ran out of time, giving Wisconsin head coach Bret Bielema his first-ever road win over a ranked opponent. It was also his 3rd win over Iowa and 2nd in Iowa City, breaking a two-game Hawkeye winning streak.Wisconsin traveled to West Lafayette to play the Purdue Boilermakers. Purdue entered the game on a two-game losing streak (losing 49–0 at Ohio State and 44–10 at Illinois), but managed to take a 10–3 lead on the Badgers before the end of the first half. An interception by Badger QB Scott Tolzien on Wisconsin's first possession of the game and a missed field goal by Wisconsin K Philip Welch helped the Boilermakers take a 10–6 lead at the half.From there, Wisconsin took command of the game. Purdue Freshman QB Sean Robinson threw an interception on the first possession of the half that set the Badgers up with excellent field position. Badger QB Scott Tolzien capitalized on the turnover, finding freshman WR Jared Abbrederis on a 7-yard touchdown strike that gave the Badgers their first lead of the game at 13–10. After an exchange of punts, the Badgers again found the end zone on a 31-yard touchdown run by RB Montee Ball, extending their lead to 20–10. Purdue K Carson Wiggs tightened the game by kicking a field goal to cut the Badger lead 20–13. However, those would be the last points of the game for the Boilermakers. Wisconsin would get another touchdown run from Ball and an interception returned for a touchdown by CB Antonio Fenelus.The Badgers won their fifth straight game over Purdue, and their 8th game of the season overall. They play Indiana in Camp Randall on November 13. After a 2–0 start to conference play, Purdue has lost their last three games. They play Michigan in West Lafayette, having won their last two games against the Wolverines.Wisconsin did not punt on any of their offensive possessions, tallied a pair of 100-yard running backs (James White and Montee Ball) and overpowered the Indiana Hoosiers. At one point, the score was 10–10, but Wisconsin would score 7 consecutive touchdowns to take a 59–10 lead before Indiana managed to kick a field goal. The Badgers put in their backup players in the 4th Quarter, but their two backup quarterbacks (Jon Budmayr and Nate Tice) managed to score a pair of touchdowns anyway.Badger QB Scott Tolzien completed 15 passes on 18 attempts with a trio of touchdown strikes. Montee Ball's 167 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns on 22 carries led Wisconsin's ground game, and his teammate James White (who had not played against Purdue with a head injury) ran for 144 yards on 19 carries with two touchdowns of his own. Wisconsin S Aaron Henry returned an interception for a touchdown late in the game to put Wisconsin up by a commanding margin and icing their win over the Hoosiers.Wisconsin's 83 points against Indiana easily broke their previous record 70 points scored against Austin Peay, which was set earlier this season. They play Michigan in Ann Arbor next week.Wisconsin would lead from start to finish of this game, shutting out the powerful Michigan Wolverine offense in the first half. The Badgers incredibly gained 380 yards of total offense in the first half. Wisconsin would close out the Wolverines from there, Michigan managed to cut Wisconsin's lead to just 10 points with a pair of back to back touchdowns. However, Wisconsin answered with a touchdown of its own. Michigan would score another 3rd-quarter touchdown, but the 4th quarter was where the Badgers took this game, outscoring the Wolverines 17–7 in the final 15:00.Wisconsin running back Montee Ball ran for 4 touchdowns on 30 carries, his 194 yards paced a powerful Badger rushing attack. Badger QB Scott Tolzien completed 14 passes on 15 attempts for 201 yards as the Badgers diced up Michigan's vulnerable secondary. Wisconsin RB James White would run for 161 yards of his own and a pair of touchdowns, he and Ball combined for 6 rushing touchdowns and well over 300 yards of total offense.Denard Robinson became the first QB to run for over 1,500 yards in a season, but he was unable to spark the Wolverines to a possible upset of a top ten Wisconsin team.With the 48–28 win, Wisconsin won in Michigan Stadium for the first time since the 1994 season (when they defeated Michigan 31–19). Wisconsin also scored more points in the game than they had ever scored in any single game against the Wolverines prior to this date. The 10–1 Badgers are now looking at a potential Rose Bowl berth and BCS game, but must play a still-dangerous Northwestern Wildcats team in Camp Randall next weekend.Wisconsin led by double digits just minutes into the game and never let go, blowing out the Wildcats en route to their eleventh victory of the season. Aided by 7 Northwestern turnovers, the Badgers played some of their best football of the season on Senior Day.Wisconsin QB Scott Tolzien, who led the nation in passing completion percentage (74.3%) in the regular season, had an excellent game in his final home start. He completed 15 passes on 19 attempts for 230 yards with 4 touchdown passes. Tolzien was not sacked once in the game, and left to a standing ovation.Wisconsin's running back duo of Montee Ball and James White tore apart Northwestern's defense on the ground, with 300+ combined rushing yards. James White eclipsed the 1,000 yards rushing mark for the season. Montee Ball's 4 touchdown runs paced the Badger ground game and he ran 20 times for 178 yards on the day.The powerful Badger offensive line had one of its best games of the season, opening holes for the running game and protecting Scott Tolzien. Bill Nagy, John Moffitt, and Gabe Carimi put together fantastic games in their final home start. Badger TE Lance Kendricks caught 4 passes for 80 yards with an acrobatic touchdown catch, and WR David Gilreath scored his only receiving touchdown in the regular season on an 18-yard strike from Tolzien. Nick Toon caught a pair of touchdown passes as well.Due to wins by Ohio State (over Michigan) and Michigan State (over Penn State), Wisconsin's win over Northwestern resulted in a tie between the teams with a 7–1 overall record. The Big Ten championship is thus split amongst the three teams, with the highest ranked team in the BCS going to the Rose Bowl.Both teams scored double digit points in the first quarter, a Rose Bowl record. The game was close throughout, and was not decided until Wisconsin failed to convert a two-point conversion late in the fourth quarter to tie the game. It was the second time the game was decided by two points, joining the 1966 game (UCLA 14, Michigan State 12).Note: G = Games played, COMP = Completions, ATT = Attempts, COMP % = Completion percentage, YDS = Passing yards, TD = Passing touchdowns, INT = Interceptions, EFF = Passing efficiencyNote: G = Games played, ATT = Attempts, YDS = Yards, AVG = Average yard per carry, LG = Longest run, TD = Rushing touchdownsNote: G = Games played, REC = Receptions, YDS = Yards, AVG = Average yard per catch, LG = Longest catch, TD = Receiving touchdownsNote: G = Games played, PR = Punt returns, PYDS = Punt return yards, PLG = Punt return long, KR = Kick returns, KYDS = Kick return yards, KLG = Kick return long, TD = Total return touchdownsNote: G = Games played, FGM = Field goals made, FGA = Field goals attempted, LG = Field goal long, XPT = Extra points made, XPT ATT = XPT attempted, TP = Total pointsNote: G = Games played, P = Punts, YDS = Yards, AVG = Average per punt, LG = Punt long, In20 = Punts inside the 20, TB = TouchbacksNote: G = Games played, Solo = Solo tackles, Ast = Assisted tackles, Total = Total tackles, TFL-Yds = Tackles for loss-yards lost, Sack = Sacks, INT = Interceptions, PD = Passes defended, FF = Forced fumbles, FR = Forced recoveries"
Minuscule 156;"Minuscule 156 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 206 (Soden),[1] is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment. Paleographically it has been assigned to the 12th century.[2] It has marginalia.The codex contains a complete text of the four Gospels on 244 parchment leaves (size 12 cm by 10 cm).[2] The text is written in one column per page, in 23 lines per page (size of text 8.2 by 6.7 cm).[2] Titles are in gold.[3]The text is divided according to the κεφαλαια (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their τιτλοι (titles of chapters) at the top of the pages. There is also another division into smaller the Ammonian Sections (in Mark 241 sections - the last in 16:20), but without references to the Eusebian Canons.[3]It contains tables of the κεφαλαια (tables of contents) before each Gospel, synaxaria, and numbers of stichoi.[3]The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden included it to the textual family Family Kx.[4] Aland placed it in Category V.[5]According to the Claremont Profile Method it belongs to the textual family Family Kx in Luke 10 and Luke 20. In Luke 1 it has mixed Byzantine text.[4]On the first of its page it is written: "Ex bibliotheca [Melchioris] Goldasti" († 1625).[3][6]The manuscript was given by Christina of Sweden to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, and bought from him by Pope Alexander VII — like codices 154, 155, 181.It was examined by Birch (about 1782), Scholz, and Oscar von Gebhardt (in 1882). C. R. Gregory saw it in 1886.[3]It is currently housed at the Vatican Library (Reg. gr. 189), at Rome.[2]"
William Basil Weston;"William Basil Weston VC (3 January 1924 – 3 March 1945) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.Weston was 21 years old, and a lieutenant[1] in the Green Howards (Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own Yorkshire Regiment),[2] British Army, attached to 1st Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.On 3 March 1945 during the attack on Meiktila, Burma, Lieutenant Weston was commanding a platoon which, together with the rest of the company, had to clear an area of the town of the enemy. In the face of fanatical opposition he led his men superbly, encouraging them from one bunker position to the next. When he came to the last, particularly well-defended bunker, he fell wounded in the entrance. Knowing that his men would not be able to capture the position without heavy casualties he pulled the pin out of one of his grenades as he lay on the ground and deliberately blew himself up with the occupants of the bunker.[3]William Basil Weston's medal was placed on permanent loan at the Green Howards Museum at Richmond in 2001 by his nephew, Basil Weston of Ulverston."
Meredith Thring;"Meredith Wooldridge Thring, FREng, FIMechE, FIET, FInstP, FIChemE, FEI (17 December 1915 – 15 September 2006)[1] was a British inventor, engineer, futurologist, professor and author.Thring was born in Melbourne, Australia, but moved to England when he was four years old.[1]  His school was Malvern College. He obtained a double first class degree in Mathematics and Physics at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1937.[1] He then joined the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, becoming Head of its Combustion Research Laboratory. In 1940, he married Margaret Hooley (died 1986), and they had two sons and one daughter.[1]In 1946, Thring became Head of the newly formed Physics Research group of the British Iron and Steel Research Association. In 1950, he moved to the University of Sheffield, becoming Professor and Head of the Department of Fuel Technology and Chemical Engineering in 1953.[1] In 1964, he took up the position of Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Queen Mary College of the University of London, where he remained until his retirement in 1981.[1] He died in Exmouth, Devon.[1]Thring was awarded the Student Medal of the Institute of Fuel in 1938, and the Hadfield Medal of the Iron and Steel Institute. From 1962 to 1963 he was President of the Institute of Fuel. In 1964 he was awarded a ScD degree from University of Cambridge. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP), the Energy Institute (FEI), the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (FIMechE), the Institution of Engineering and Technology (FIET), and the Institution of Chemical Engineers (FIChemE).[1] He was one of the first Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng).[1]Thring was a visionary who changed from science to engineering "because he wanted to make the world a better place".[1] In his 1977 book How to Invent, he wrote "One can envisage a society in which man lives in near-equilibrium with his environment, with the minimum use of raw materials by fuel economy, complete recycling of all metals, no throw-away goods, all consumer goods built to last many decades, and near zero pollution.".[2] In the same book he describes domestic and gardening tools, Intermediate Technology for less developed countries and robots to take the place of people in dangerous situations. However, these were not just imagining. At the University of Sheffield and Queen Mary College he was actively involved in robotics. He produced a stair-climbing robot, an autonomous fire-fighting robot, and one for clearing a table.[3]  After his retirement he founded a charity called Power Aid to help developing countries.[4] In 1969 he predicted a future in which factories would be largely automatic, controlled by a central computer, and supposed that this would reduce the human working week to 10 or 20 hours.[5]He studied combustion and other forms of energy generation, and was one of the founders of the International Flame Research Foundation.[1]  This knowledge of energy was shown in his 1974 book Energy and Humanity which called essentially for a more rational and sustainable approach, with control of pollution.  He was also known as a teacher, and for his belief that engineers had an ethical obligation to improve life for all, but notably the underprivileged and disabled.[6]"
The Eye that Cries;"The Eye that Cries (El Ojo que Llora in Spanish) is a memorial that was born as a private initiative designed to honor the thousands of victims as a result of terrorism in Peru, to strengthen the collective memory of all Peruvians and to promote peace and reconciliation in the country.[1]The Eye that Cries is part of a larger project called The Memory Alameda which will incorporate other art pieces, large extensions of green areas and the Museum of Memory (Yuyanapaq).The memorial, The Eye That Cries, located in El Campo de Marte, a park in Jesús María District, Lima was completed in 2005. It was conceptualized and executed by Lika Mutal, an originally Dutch artist who lives and works in both New York and Lima. At the center of the memorial is a black stone which Mutal discovered near a pre-Columbian cemetery.[2]The memorial was built primarily as a way to commemorate the roughly 70,000 victims of the violence committed by both the Peruvian military government and the radical guerrilla group attempting to fight against the government and all those who opposed their communist ideologies. The primary guerrilla group was the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso in Spanish), a radically communist terrorist group who resisted those who opposed them through radical actions, including violence. The government armed forces only added to the violence by fighting the guerrilla group.[3] Most of the crimes, which took place in a span of twenty years (1980–2000) remained unspoken of until the Peruvian Commission of Truth and Reconciliation (Comisión de Verdad y Reconciliación in Spanish) brought them to the public. After President Alberto Fujimori fled the country in 2000, human rights committees and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission began the process of reconciling the crimes that had occurred.[4]The Peruvian Commission of Truth and Reconciliation (CVR) filed a public report in 2003 where it spoke of the crimes that occurred during those two decades, and the rulings placed pressure on the Peruvian government to commemorate all of the victims.[3] The CVR's extensive report stated that during those two decades of violence, 69,280 people had either died or disappeared, roughly 600,000 people became internal refugees, and 40,000 children became orphans.[3] The truth commission also reported that the majority of the victims of the crimes were indigenous victims who lived in isolated highlands. The report stated that three out of four victims of the brutal crimes were indigenous, roughly 85 percent of all of the victims.[3] The fact that the indigenous were one of the most marginalized groups in society and that they lived in highlands away from main cities made it easy for the crimes of the Senderos and the military officials to go unreported. Their marginalization and their isolation made this highly victimized group silent and they were powerless both against the guerrilla group and the government.[4]Though the members of the Shining Path contributed to over half of the roughly 70,000 people killed during this twenty-year period, 41 members were still added to the names of the victims in The Eye That Cries memorial. The reason these members were added was due to an armed conflict that occurred in 1992 in Castro Castro prison. Important leaders of the radical guerrilla were captured and imprisoned in Miguel Castro Castro penitentiary. In 1992 in Castro Castro, there was a military raid in which forty-one Senderos were targeted and killed during the span of four days.[4] The names of those forty-one Senderos among the victims listed in The Eye That Cries would later cause a controversy since a large portion of the deaths had been at the hands of Senderos. Peruvians considered the Senderos to be terrorists as opposed to victims.Evidence of Fujimori's corrupt government surfaced and led him to flee to Japan in 2000. Due to the massive amount of corruption during Alberto Fujimori's presidential terms that included blackmail, bribes, and vote-rigging, an investigation into his administration began in 2000 that was led by Alejandro Toledo. The Peruvian government was then urged by human rights organizations to form the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR) which would investigate the political violence, human rights violations, and government corruption that had afflicted Peru since the 1980s and during Fujimori's presidential terms. When the CVR finished its final report in August 2003, it recommended that to help aid the process of reconciliation, memorials need to be created to pay tribute to the many victims of political violence in Peru. In 2004, Jesus Maria, a district in Lima, was designated as the location for the project Alameda de La Memoria which would give an actual place to the many marginalized voices that were silenced and victimized during the decades of Peruvian conflict. Alameda de la Memoria would provide a space to contemplate and remember, not only for the victims and their families, but also for the Peruvian population. This project would be located in the park Campo de Marte, and would include the memorial The Eye that Cries.When Lika Mutal began to work on creating The Eye That Cries, she was given a list of names of individuals who were considered to be victims of violence. This list of names was supplied by the TRC, and she would later incorporate the nearly 32,000 names into the monument. Unknown to her, the list of names she was given included not only the thousands of victims who were killed during decades of Peru's armed conflict, but also the names of 41 victims who were killed in Castro Castro Prison during a prison raid in May 1992.[5] The victims killed during the Castro Castro Prison raid were "organizers and militants of the Shining Path, Peru's notorious guerrilla movement.[4] A large number of the Peruvian population views the members of the Shining Path as terrorists responsible for a majority of the deaths of victims of armed conflict in Peru during the 1980s and 1990s.[6] The inclusion of the names of those murdered due to political unrest, guerrilla attacks, and prison raids creates a clash when at times both victims and perpetrators are included side by side and deemed as victims. This conflict leads to the question of what constitutes a victim, who has the right to judge whether an individual is a victim, and whether a criminal can be considered a victim. From the perspective of International Human Rights Laws "those killed extra judicially, including convicted criminals" are considered victims.[4] Yet, from the perspective of a majority of the Peruvian population, the members of Shining Path were considered to be terrorists responsible for mass murders and destruction.When Like Mutal completed The Eye That Cries in 2005, it did not create any major controversies, as both the artist, and the Peruvian Population were unaware that the names of 41 Senderistas were included among the 32,000 names of victims written in stones. In November 2006, a ruling by the Inter-American Court on Human Rights based on investigations of the prison raid in Castro Castro and the deaths of the 41 inmates, stated that these deaths were a violation of human rights. After being accused of human rights violations, Peru was instructed to give reparations to the families of the Castro Castro victims and give a public acknowledgment and ceremony that paid honor to the victims and the families of those whose human rights were violated in the Castro Castro raid. In addition, the ruling of the Inter-American Court stated that the names of these victims be included in The Eye that Cries monument within the coming year.[7]When the rulings of the Inter American Court in 2006 became known, the public and the press expressed outrage. Although the prisoners of the Castro Castro prison had indeed suffered human rights violations, they were still deemed "terrorists" by the majority of the Peruvian public and press. The idea that victims and "their perpetrators'" names would be combined under a monument that symbolized reconciliation and a place for family members to mourn their lost ones was one that the Peruvian public was not willing to support. What was ironic though, was that the names of the Castro Castro prison victims had been included in The Eye that Cries since 2005. It took well over one year for the Peruvian press to become aware of this transgression, and it was only because of the ruling of the Inter American Court that the subject itself was brought to light.[4] The differing opinions regarding The Eye that Cries halted the completion of the Memory Alameda, which if realized would have been a three part installation.[4]In September 2007, Alberto Fujimori was extradited from Chile to Peru where he would stand trial for the violations of human rights and corruption that occurred during his presidential terms. The day after Alberto Fujimori arrived in Lima, Peru, a group of men and women vandalized The Eye that Cries by destroying stones and pouring orange paint on the central stone, and then littering the monument with paint cans. It is believed that the group members responsible for this act of vandalism were supporters of Alberto Fujimori's government not only because of the proximity of Fujimori's arrival and the attack, but because orange is the color of Fujimori's campaign.[4]In an interview done by El Comercio, Lika Mutal was asked if she would include the names of the 41 victims murdered in the Castro Castro prison raid in her monument. She responded by saying that, "I couldn't. They were criminals, killed outside the rule of law, but criminals nonetheless. If reparations have to be granted to their families, the reparations should be directed to remedy the damage they caused."[8][9] When it was discovered that the names of terrorists had been included in The Eye that Cries monument, Lika Mutal responded in an interview with La Republica by saying that she had no knowledge that the names of terrorists were included in the stones. She said that the list given to her by the CVR was marked as the registry that included all of the victims.[9]After visiting the Yuyanapaq exhibit, that narrates the more than twenty years of armed conflict in Peru through photographs, Lika Mutal felt inspired. Working primarily with stone, Lika returned to her studio, where she viewed her artistic medium with a new perspective. She says that upon seeing the stone, the phrase "The Eye that Cries" formed in her head. After this moment, she decided to work on this project, and through private sponsors and donations was able to accumulate the necessary funds for The Eye that Cries.[10]The Eye that Cries is located in the middle of a labyrinth. The labyrinth itself is composed of tens of thousands of rocks. Each individual rock is inscribed with a name, age, and year of death of a victim of Peru's decades of internal conflict. The sculpture is representative of Pachamama, which in Quechua means Mother Earth. In the center of the sculpture, a small stone that takes the form of an eye continuously trickles water.[11]For the survivors, family, and friends of the victims of the violent crimes, The Eye That Cries memorial is a place where they are able to mourn the loss of loved ones. This memorial captures all of the loss, and suffering of the people who were affected by the crimes. For the family members whose loved ones were part of the large group of people who disappeared, the memorial is the only place they are able to mourn and remember.[4]Many mourners come to the memorial and leave flowers next to the stone with the name of their loved one as a way to supplement the fact that their body was never recovered. Having this common, public place to remember has become an important way of keeping the memory alive.[4] The site is a way for Peruvian citizens to attempt to reconcile all the crimes that were committed, along with having a site to mourn their dead, the memorial served as a way to finally publicly display the violent and complicated history of Peru.[4] The memory of the dead and violence that Peru has experienced also serves as a way to strengthen democratic ideologies. The memorial site also has annual events such as a ceremony on El Dia De Los Muertos, along with serving as a location of Buddhist prayer ceremonies.[3] The ruling of the Inter-American court and subsequent controversy has led to an increase in popularity and visits to the memorial site.[4]"
United Nations Command;"Korea and the United Nations Permanent Mission of North Korea to the UN UNSC Resolution 702 (membership admission in 1991)List of Security Council resolutionsCOI Report on Human Rights in the DPRK (2014)United Nations Command (UNC or UN Command)[1] is the multinational military force established to support the Republic of Korea (South Korea) during and after the Korean War. It was the first international unified command in history, and the first attempt at collective security pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations.[1]The UNC was established on 7 July 1950 following the UN Security Council's recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea. The motion passed because the Soviet Union, a close ally of North Korea and a member of the UN Security Council, was boycotting the UN at the time over its recognition of the Republic of China rather than the People's Republic of China.[2] UN member states were called to provide assistance in repelling the North's invasion, with the UNC providing a cohesive command structure under which the disparate forces would operate.[3] During the course of the war, 22 nations contributed military or medical personnel to UN Command,[1] although the United States led the UNC and provided the bulk of its troops and funding, all participants formally fought under the auspices of the UN,[4] with the operation classified as a "UN-led police action".[5]On 27 July 1953, United Nations Command, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers signed the Korean Armistice Agreement, ending open hostilities. The agreement established the Military Armistice Commission (MAC), consisting of representatives of the signatories, to supervise the implementation of the armistice terms, and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), composed of nations that did not participate in the conflict, to monitor the armistice's restrictions on the parties' reinforcing or rearming themselves.[Note 1][6] In 1975, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 3390 (XXX), which called upon the parties to the Armistic Agreement to replace it with a peace agreement, and expressed the hope that UNC would be dissolved on 1 January 1976.[7] But the UNC continues to function after that.[8]Since 1953, UNC's primary duties have been to maintain the armistice and facilitate diplomacy between North and South Korea.[9] Although "MAC" meetings have not occurred since 1994, UN Command representatives routinely engage members of the Korean People's Army in formal and informal meetings. The most recent formal negotiations on the terms of Armistice occurred between October and November 2018. Duty officers from both sides of the Joint Security Area (commonly known as the Truce Village of Panmunjom) conduct daily communications checks and have the ability to engage face-to-face when the situation demands.[10]United Nations Command operates under the mandates of UN Security Council Resolutions 82, 83, and 84. These only passed because the Soviet Union was boycotting the UN for giving China's seat in the Security council to Taiwan, and because Taiwan had China's seat on the Security Council.[11] While the UN had some military authority through Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, Cold War tensions meant that the forces envisaged in those articles had never become reality. Thus the UN had little practical ability to raise a military force in response to the North Korean invasion of the South. Consequently, the UN Security Council designated the United States as the executive agent for leading a "unified command" under the UN flag. As such, the United Nations exercised no control over the combat forces. However, as this represented one of the first attempts at collective security under the UN system, UN leadership maintained a close relationship with UN Command during the war and for years after hostilities ceased.When the warring parties signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, the UNC delivered the Agreement to the United Nations. In August 1953, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution “noting with approval” the Armistice Agreement, a step that was critical for the UN to take the next step of organizing the 1954 Geneva Conference meant to negotiate a diplomatic peace between North and South Korea. The adoption of the Korean Armistice Agreement in the General Assembly underwrites UN Command's current role of maintaining and enforcing the Armistice Agreement.The role of the United States as the executive agent for the unified command has led to questions over its continued validity. Most notably, in 1994, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali wrote in a letter to the North Korean Foreign Minister that:the Security Council did not establish the unified command as a subsidiary organ under its control, but merely recommended the creation of such a command, specifying that it be under the authority of the United States. Therefore, the dissolution of the unified command does not fall within the responsibility of any United Nations organ but is a matter within the competence of the Government of the United States.[12]The UN's official position is that the Korean War-era Security Council and General Assembly resolutions remain in force. This was evidenced in 2013 when North Korea announced unilateral abrogation of the Armistice Agreement: UN spokesman Martin Nesirky asserted that since the Armistice Agreement had been adopted by the General Assembly, no single party could dissolve it unilaterally. The UNC continues to serve as the signatory and party of the Armistice opposite the Korean People's Army.After troops of North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 82 calling on North Korea to cease hostilities and withdraw to the 38th parallel.[13]Two days later, the UNSC adopted Resolution 83, recommending that members of the United Nations provide assistance to the Republic of Korea "to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security to the area".[14]The first non-Korean and non-U.S. unit to see combat was the No. 77 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force, which began escort, patrol and ground attack sorties from Iwakuni, Japan on 2 July 1950. On 29 June 1950, New Zealand made preparations to dispatch two Loch class frigates, Tutira and Pukaki, to Korean waters,[15] on 3 July, the ships left Devonport Naval Base, Auckland and joined other Commonwealth forces at Sasebo, Japan on 2 August. For the duration of the war, at least two NZ vessels would be on station in the theater.Resolution 84, adopted on 7 July 1950, recommended that members providing military forces and other assistance to South Korea "make such forces and other assistance available to a unified command under the United States of America".[16]President Syngman Rhee of the Republic of Korea assigned operational command of ROK ground, sea, and air forces to General MacArthur as Commander-in-Chief UN Command (CINCUNC) on 15 July 1950:In view of the common military effort of the United Nations on behalf of the Republic of Korea, in which all military forces, land, sea and air, of all the United Nations fighting in or near Korea have been placed under your operational command, and in which you have been designated Supreme Commander United Nations Forces, I am happy to assign to you command authority over all land, sea, and air forces of the Republic of Korea during the period of the continuation of the present state of hostilities, such command to be exercised either by you personally or by such military commander or commanders to whom you may delegate the exercise of this authority within Korea or in adjacent seas.[17]On 29 August 1950, the British Commonwealth's 27th Infantry Brigade arrived at Busan to join UNC ground forces, which until then included only ROK and U.S. forces. The 27th Brigade moved into the Naktong River line west of Daegu.Units from other countries of the UN followed: the Belgian United Nations Command, the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade, the Colombian Battalion,[18] the Ethiopian Kagnew Battalion, the French Battalion, the Greek 15th Infantry Regiment, New Zealand's 16th Field Regiment and Royal New Zealand Artillery, the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea, the South African No. 2 Squadron SAAF, the Turkish Brigade, and forces from Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Additionally, Denmark, India, Iran, Norway and Sweden provided medical units, Italy provided a hospital, even though it was not a UN member.By 1 September 1950, less than two months before the formation of United Nations Command, these combined forces numbered 180,000, of which 92,000 were South Koreans, with most of the remainder being Americans, followed by the 1,600-man British 27th Infantry Brigade.During the three years of the Korean War, the following nations were members of the UNC.[20] By 27 July 1953, the day the Armistice Agreement was signed, UNC had reached a peak strength of 932,964:During the course of the war, UNC was led by Douglas MacArthur, Matthew B. Ridgway, and Mark Wayne Clark. After the armistice was signed, John E. Hull was named UNC commander to carry out the ceasefire (including the voluntary repatriation of prisoners of war).[22]Following the signing of the Armistice Agreement, UNC remained in Korea to fulfill the functions of providing security and stability on the Peninsula, as well as supporting UN efforts to rebuild the war-torn Republic of Korea. Much of the fifties was marked by continuous negotiations in Military Armistice Commission meetings while the international community worked to bolster South Korea's economy and infrastructure. During this period, North Korea maintained economic and military superiority over its southern neighbor owing to Chinese and Soviet support.The sixties proved a tenuous decade on the Korean Peninsula, punctuated by a period of hostilities often referred to as the "Second Korean War." The period between 1966 and 1969 saw a heightened level of skirmishes in the DMZ as well as major incidents including North Korea's attempted assassination of South Korean leader Park Chung-hee and seizure of the USS Pueblo.The seventies saw a brief period of rapprochement that later contributed to structural changes to UNC. In 1972, the North and South Korean governments signed a Joint Communique calling for more peaceful ties between the two Koreas. Concurrently, consecutive U.S. administrations (Nixon, Ford, and Carter) sought to decrease the South Korean reliance upon U.S. forces for maintaining deterrent capabilities on the Korean Peninsula. On 7 November 1978 a combined headquarters, the Republic of Korea – United States Combined Forces Command (CFC), was created, and the South Korean military units with front-line missions were transferred from the UN Command to the CFC's operational control. The commander-in-chief of the CFC, a United States military officer, answered ultimately to the national command authorities of the United States and that of South Korea.From 1978, UNC maintained its primary functions of maintaining and enforcing the Korean Armistice Agreement, facilitating diplomacy that could support a lasting peace on the Peninsula, and providing a command that could facilitate multinational contributions should the armistice fail. UNC decreased in size, and over time, many of the billets assigned to UNC became multi-hatted with U.S. Forces Korea and Combined Forces Command.The 1990s again saw notable change in UNC. In October 1991, UNC transferred responsibility of all DMZ sectors except for the Joint Security Area to the ROK military. In 1992, UNC appointed a South Korean General officer to serve as the Senior Member to the Military Armistice Commission. This led to the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers boycotting MAC meetings. The collapse of the Soviet Union also led North Korea to question the alignment of their choices for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. They no longer recognized Czech or Slovak representatives of Czechoslovakia when the nation split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 1994, North Korea expelled the Polish delegation and also dismissed the Chinese People's Volunteers from the Panmunjom mission. Owing in part being protest over China's warming ties with South Korea.Since 1998, UNC has seen a gradual increase of permanent international staff within the command. In between 1998 and 2003, several of the original contributors to the Korean War began deploying personnel to Korea to support UNC's armistice maintenance functions. This internationalization has continued over the next decades. In May 2018,[23] Canadian Lt. General Wayne Eyre became the first non-American to serve as deputy commander of the UNC.[23][24][25][26] Succeeding him was Australian Vice Admiral Stuart Mayer, and the Lieutenant General Andrew Harrison of the British Army, continuing the trend of non-American leadership in UNC.United Nations Command-Rear is located at Yokota Air Base, Japan and is commanded by a Royal Australian Air Force group captain with a deputy commander from the Canadian Forces. Its task is to maintain the SOFA that permits the UNC to retain a logistics rear and staging link on Japanese soil.[27]To further the September 2018 inter-Korean Comprehensive Military Agreement, UN Command, Republic of Korea Armed Forces, and North Korean People's Army officials met in a series of negotiations to deliberate the demilitarization of the Joint Security Area. The first two meetings in October led to Demining activities within the JSA, de-arming of personnel, and sealing off of Guard Posts. On November 6, 2018, UNC conducted a third round of negotiations with the South Korean military and North Korean People's Army on "Rules of Interaction" which would underwrite a Joint Security Area where both sides of the Military Demarcation Line—the de facto border—would be open to personnel. For undisclosed reasons, the North Korean side refused to meet to finalize these rules and the next step for realizing a demilitarized Joint Security Area."

DZFE;"DZFE (98.7 FM) is a classical music FM radio station, owned and operated by Far East Broadcasting Company - Philippines. The station's studio and transmitter are located on the 46th floor of One Corporate Centre, Meralco Ave. cor. Doña Julia Vargas Ave., Ortigas Center, Pasig. This station operates daily from 6:00 AM to 3:00 AM.[1][2]DZFE was the second radio station established by American missionaries, who founded the first station (DZAS) of Far East Broadcasting Company in 1948. FEBC's mission of bringing “Christ to the World by Radio” was first directed toward China. However, in 1954, FEBC stepped forward to answer a government bid for the establishment of a classical music station.On June 1, 1954, DZFE marked its inaugural broadcast. It aired from 6pm to 8pm, playing motets and chorales from Strauss II, Rimsky-Korsakov, Filipino musical (My Nipa Hut), and Bach, at a frequency of 1030 kilocycles.Initially, the broadcast comprised sequenced music, programming provided by the network's English Service was brought in to augment the material. DZFE debuted its first full day of broadcast on April 4, 1961, signing on at 5AM and signing off at 11PM.John Hubbard became the station's new director in 1963. He had previously led the music faculty of Westmont College in California, and gave DZFE's programming the educational impetus and Gospel-centered worldview it possesses to the present day.  In 1965, DZFE's staff acquired its second member with the addition of Joy Dulaca, née Abiera, a music graduate of Silliman University in Dumaguete, who took over the leadership of the station in 1975 when Hubbard returned to the United States.During the 1986 People Power Revolution, the operators of Radio Veritas, who were operating as "Radyo Bandido" to give people information about movements around Camp Crame and Camp Aguionaldo, briefly considered asking to use DZFE's transmitter in Bulacan after Marcos' soldiers had knocked out their tower.  However, they decided it was instead better to request access to the transmitter of DZRJ in Sta. Mesa, which was closer.[3]In 1997, then managed by Ma. Teresa “Rexey” Domingo, DZFE transferred its office and studio from the FEBC Compound in Karuhatan, Valenzuela to Cityland 10 Tower 1 in Makati. This was to move the station closer to its listeners, many of whom resided in the latter area.Dan Andrew Cura assumed management of the station in 2000. He left to take on other responsibilities within the FEBC network in 2002, and was succeeded by Maribel Fernandez. The withdrawal of foreign subsidies following 9/11,  in addition to other fiscal difficulties, spurred a decision to reduce the broadcast by 40% in 2003. The station has had to resort to similar measures before: in 1976, DZFE cut broadcast to a mere six hours, from 4PM to midnight, and in 1986, DZFE was off the air from noon to 6PM.The management of the station was entrusted to current station manager Tiffany Liong-Gabuya in 2004, she assumed full management of the station in 2005. That year, owing to the proliferation of tall buildings around its Makati antenna, DZFE transferred its transmitting facilities to a leased site in Crestview Subd., Antipolo, Rizal (a site shared with commercial stations, UNTV-37 and NU 107 (now 107.5 Wish FM) all owned by Progressive Broadcasting Corporation, and Radio Philippines Network for digital TV broadcasts), and downgraded its transmitting power from 20 kW to 5 kW, in order to control power costs.In 2006, DZFE reclaimed 10 hours of the broadcast week, restoring quality programming to the 10PM to midnight block. In June 2008, it extended its broadcast back to 18 hours a day, 6 days a week. In January 2010, it completed its return to its daily 18-hour broadcasts.The station also regained signal strength. In April 2009, DZFE began broadcast from a newly purchased Nautel NV20 transmitter, entirely funded by donations from local and foreign FEBC supporters, and is the first of its kind in the Philippines.[4]The station once more relocated its office, studio and transmitting facilities in June and July 2012, this time to Ortigas Center, Pasig. Off air for a few days from June 21 for the move, the station began broadcasting on July 2 from the 46th floor of One Corporate Center. The relocation was part of a larger migration that involved the transfer of FEBC's main offices and the office and studio of its Manila AM station, 702 DZAS, to Pasig from Valenzuela City, while its archived and miscellaneous contents were also transferred to FEBC's shortwave facilities in Bocaue, Bulacan. After the transfer, the 10 kW transmitting power finally doubled to 20 kW.One year after the move, in June 2013, and after years of working through several backroom issues, DZFE's broadcast became available outside the Greater Metro Manila area through online streaming. In September 2013, DZFE expanded its schedule to a 21-hour-a-day daily broadcast, the longest schedule DZFE has maintained in its history.Since July 2017, DZFE has been available as an audio simulcast via Cignal TV Channel 314.At present, 98.7 DZFE is also test broadcast via digital HD Radio via the HD1 channel. The HD2 channel carries a simulcast of sister AM station DZAS.The HD3 channel carries Now XD, a Christian music-formatted digital HD Radio and internet station owned by FEBC. Prior to Now XD, FEBC launched a similar Christian music block under the title Now Radio, which used to be aired from 10PM to midnight in the early 2000s."

Tenzin (The Legend of Korra);"Tenzin (丹增, Dān Zēng) is a major character in Nickelodeon's animated television series The Legend of Korra, which aired from 2012 to 2014. The character and the series, a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. He is voiced by J. K. Simmons. Tenzin's father, Aang, was the Avatar who preceded Korra and kept world peace by preventing the Fire Nation from taking over the world during the Hundred Year War, which occurred about seventy years before the beginning of The Legend of Korra. Tenzin's mother, Katara, greatly assisted Aang in his efforts to save the Earth Kingdom from destruction. Tenzin is the youngest of the three children of Aang and Katara.Tenzin is the lead character Korra's airbending master and spiritual mentor. He is the son of Aang and Katara. As the only airbender to be born in over a hundred years, Tenzin was taught the traditions and customs of the Air Nomads by his father, eventually earning the traditional Air Nomad tattoos. Tenzin inherited most of his father's mementos prior to his father's death.[1] After Korra (who would eventually become Tenzin's student) was revealed at a very young age as the new Avatar, Tenzin, along with Sokka, Zuko, and Korra's father, Tonraq, thwarted an attempt to kidnap the child. The kidnappers, led by Zaheer, were apprehended and imprisoned. Because of this threat and the potential for future threats, Tenzin and Tonraq elected to move Korra to a compound at the Southern Water Tribe where she could live and train in safety.[2]Tenzin has a longstanding friendship with Lin Beifong, who is the daughter of Toph Beifong, and at one point the two characters were romantically involved.[3] Tenzin offered her comfort and a higher level of trust was reached between the two. However, their romantic relationship deteriorated, partially because Tenzin wanted children while Lin did not and because of Lin's abrasive nature.[4] It was during this time that Pema, who was an acolyte of the Air Nation, approached Tenzin and confessed her feelings for him. This indirectly led to the end of Tenzin's romantic relationship with Lin and the beginning of his relationship with Pema. The two eventually married, and would have four children: Jinora, Ikki, Meelo and Rohan.In stark contrast to his father Aang, and his siblings Bumi and Kya, Tenzin is described as a stern and serious character. The character does possess a sense of humor which he shows at times. Tenzin projects a calm demeanor, but can be flustered by perceived foolishness or madness. The character is also characterized as prideful, particularly when it comes to addressing his shortcomings. Tenzin is also described as a traditionalist, though he has shown openness in breaking with tradition.Tenzin was envisioned to link The Legend of Korra with the series’ prequel, Avatar: The Last Airbender. Tenzin is one of three major characters in The Legend of Korra (Korra and Lin Beifong being the other two) who has a direct association with major characters in Avatar: The Last Airbender. Aang and Katara are the character's parents, while Sokka is his uncle. Tenzin was also envisaged to carry on his father's Aang's legacy and to serve as a spiritual mentor to the new Avatar, Korra.[5] His clothing, which is similar to Avatar Aang's, was designed to reflect his heritage as both an Air Nomad and as the previous Avatar's son.[6]Tenzin's siblings, Kya and Bumi, were originally intended to be airbenders as well.[7] However this was later revised, with Kya reworked as a waterbender and Bumi initially a non-bender.[8] Tenzin's design was very difficult to keep consistent as the animators had difficulty with consistently drawing the character's nose correctly.[9] At the time of these series initial production in 2011 the reigning Dalai Lama's name was Tenzin Gyatso. However it is unclear if the creators named the character after Gyatso.Tenzin was beaten profusely in the season three finale, causing some fans to believe the character had been killed, only for him to later be revealed alive. Series co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino stated that he and Bryan Konietzko never talked of killing the character off. Konietzko explained the reason the "full beatdown" was not seen was because it could not be shown and attributed fans thinking the character would die was due to the death of the Earth Queen earlier in the season.[10]In Book One, after a teenaged Korra successfully completed her training in the other three elements, Tenzin took her on as his pupil and trained her in the art of airbending and in spiritual matters.[1] Korra left her home and moved in with Tenzin's residence on Air Temple Island, which is part of Republic City.[11]  Initially, the training sessions went poorly with the master and pupil arguing frequently.[12] However, after Korra was incapacitated and nearly rendered powerless by an enemy Amon, leader of a subversive movement who specialized in taking away the bending abilities of people, she revealed to Tenzin her deep-seated fears of Amon, crying on Tenzin's shoulder.[13] Tenzin offered her comfort and a higher level of trust was established between the two.Later when Republic City came under attack from Amon's forces, Tenzin, his wife and their children were ultimately captured by Amon and were facing the real prospect of losing their bending when they were rescued by Korra and Mako. Korra would subsequently lose most of her bending abilities. After Korra regained her bending and restored Lin's earthbending through energybending, Tenzin told her "I am so proud of you, Avatar Korra."[14]In Book Two, Tenzin's relationship with Korra would once again be strained with Korra effectively dismissing Tenzin as her spiritual mentor, replacing him with her uncle Unalaq. While she chose to remain at the South Pole, he left for the Southern Air Temple with his family and siblings, Bumi and Kya.[15] While at the Southern Air Temple, Tenzin, Bumi and Kya would discuss past familial conflicts and eventually find closure to past hurts and sleights.[16] Tenzin would eventually reunite with Korra, with the latter restoring the former as her spiritual mentor. Later when his daughter Jinora's soul was trapped in the Spirit World by Unalaq, who was revealed as a villain, Tenzin and his allies set out toward the South Pole to enter the Spirit World through the spirit portal there. In the Spirit World, Tenzin would encounter his father Aang's spirit. When Tenzin shared with Aang that he felt he was failure in following his father's footsteps, Aang encouraged Tenzin to be himself and not try to be someone else. Tenzin, encouraged by this would eventually find Jinora's soul in the Spirit World.[17] During Harmonic Convergence (a moment where all the planets in the solar system aligned perfectly), after Tenzin learned that Raava had been destroyed, severing Korra's connection to her past lives, he helped Korra learn how to bend her own spirit and fight Unalaq, who at this point was consumed by Vaatu and became the "Dark Avatar". Tenzin and others successfully defended Korra's body against countless evil spirits while her spiritual essence was locked in battle against the "Dark Avatar" until she returned. Korra, with the help of Jinora, emerged victorious.[18]Book Three saw the rebirth of the Air Nation. Many non-benders, including Tenzin's brother Bumi, suddenly acquired the art of airbending.[19] Tenzin along with Korra, Asami Sato, Mako, Bolin and Bumi would go on a quest to recruit the new airbenders to rebuild the Air Nation. Initially the effort was met with limited success with only an orphan boy named Kai joining the Air Nation.[20] However at the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se, the group discovered that a number of airbenders were imprisoned by the Earth Queen. The group would successfully liberate the captive airbenders who all agreed to join the Air Nation.[2] At the Northern Air Temple, Tenzin attempted to impart cultural knowledge to his pupils, but they generally showed little interest in learning about Air Nomad culture. The group would soon be joined by Ikki, Meelo, Pema, Kya and other airbenders who made the lengthy trek from Air Temple Island. Tenzin began to employ military-style training on his new recruits as well as Bumi, who was the one who suggested that Tenzin needed to employ harsher training methods if he was to become a successful teacher. Initially, the recruits did not respond favorably to his strict regimen. Later the training would pay off as his students, led by Bumi, were able to fend off a group of earthbending rustlers who were illegally capturing the Air Bison in the area.[21] Subsequently, Zaheer and his allies arrived at the Northern Air Temple. After Zaheer revealed that he planned to capture the Air Nation and use them as leverage against Korra, Tenzin, along Bumi and Kya engaged in a battle with Zaheer, Ghazan, Ming-Hua and P'li in a desperate attempt to protect the rest of his family and his students. In his duel with Zaheer, Tenzin gained the upper hand. Soon however the tide of the battle turned when Ghazan and Ming-Hua joined the fight, the two having handily beaten Tenzin's siblings. P'li would subsequently join the fight. Despite being badly outnumbered, Tenzin fought valiantly, refusing to yield. He was eventually overcome by the four, sustaining severe injuries in the battle.[22] The four took all the residents of the Northern Air Temple as prisoner, save Kai who was thought dead, but ultimately survived. Tenzin was essentially incapacitated for the rest of his time at the Northern Air Temple. He was eventually rescued by Asami, Bolin and Mako.[23] Weeks later, a fully recuperated Tenzin presided over Jinora's ceremony, installing her as an airbending master. He announced that while Korra, who sustained serious injuries in her brutal fight with Zaheer, recuperated, the Air Nation would assist in restoring peace and balance to the world, essentially taking over the Avatar's role.[24]Book Four saw the Air Nation make good on Tenzin's promise to assist others. They primarily focused their efforts around the Earth Kingdom which had fallen into disarray after the murder of the Earth Queen.[25] Tenzin, who in effect was the political head of the Air Nation, was present at Wu's coronation ceremony when Kuvira appointed herself as the leader of the new Earth Empire. Concerned about Kuvira's declarations, Tenzin and the world leaders convened after the coronation and agreed to send Suyin Beifong, Lin's half-sister, as their representative to speak with Kuvira and convince her to step down. However, Kuvira was unmoved, holding on to her position.[26] Tenzin subsequently tasked his children with a mission to locate Korra, whose whereabouts at this point were unknown, and bring her to Republic City.[27] The children would successfully complete their mission returning Korra back to Republic City. When Korra shared with Tenzin that she felt like a failure in being badly outclassed by Kuvira in a battle, Tenzin stated no one expected her to face the dictator alone and that it was everyone's responsibility to resolve the Kuvira crisis.[28] Several days later, Tenzin attended a meeting to discuss the Republic City's evacuation process in the scenario that Kuvira attacked the city. The meeting was interrupted by Lin, Suyin, Zhu Li, and Bolin, the latter who informed him the existence of Kuvira's powerful cannon. When Zhu Li added that Kuvira planned to invade the city two weeks later, Tenzin returned to his family at Air Temple Island to encourage them to leave the city. Instead, Pema and his three eldest children elected to stay and assist in any way possible. Later, Tenzin was chosen by Korra to be part of a stealth airbender team tasked with kidnapping Kuvira's fiancé, Bataar Jr, with the intention of using him as a bargaining chip against Kuvira. Utilizing their wingsuits, they successfully acquired their target, dumping him in a large traveling bag and transporting him to their hideout. Tenzin stood by as Korra eventually managed to force Baatar Jr. to contact Kuvira to call off her attack. To everyone's surprise, Kuvira traced the radio signal back to their location and decided destroy it with her cannon. Tenzin narrowly escaped certain death.[29] Tenzin and his friends would eventually emerge victorious over Kuvira and her army.[30] In the series denouement, Tenzin hosted and attended Varrick and Zhu Li's wedding ceremony on Air Temple Island. Outside the after-party, Tenzin engaged in a conversation with the Avatar. Tenzin complimented his pupil noting that she transformed the world more in the few years than most of her predecessors did in their lifetimes. Tenzin was pleased to hear Korra confide that she felt her journey had only begun and that she desired to learn and do more. The moment was interrupted by Asami, however, who informed him that Varrick desired to borrow a wingsuit and jump off a tower. Tenzin immediately ran off to stop Varrick.[31]In part one, Tenzin and the Air Nation help out at the evacuee camp for people whose homes were destroyed in Kuvira's assault. Upon Korra and Asami's return from the Spirit World, Tenzin fills them in on the situation at the camp. Tenzin notes that President Raiko was too preoccupied with his re-election to help the evacuees. Tenzin then accompanies Korra when she goes to reassure the evacuees and lift their spirits."Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind."Tenzin is highly skilled in Airbending which utilizes aikido and the Chinese martial arts techniques of Baguazhang and Xing Yi Quan.[32][33][34][35] The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style.[36] Airbending represents the element of freedom,[37] and is categorized as the most elusive of the "four bending arts". Airbending involves "smooth coiling and uncoiling actions", dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques, and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the "intangibility and explosive power of wind". These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow—allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury—a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people.Tenzin was generally received well by the media and fans. As Korra's mentor, Tenzin's relationship with Korra has drawn comparisons with both Iroh's relationship with Zuko in the series' predecessor, Avatar the Last Airbender[38] and Luke Skywalker's relationship with Yoda in the film The Empire Strikes Back.[39] The depiction of Tenzin's struggles to establish his own identity outside of his father Aang also received positive reviews, praised as adding depth to the character.[40] The portrayal of the character's complicated relationship with his siblings was also well-received, with reviewer Keval Shah noting that the depiction not only further developed the character, but helped make Tenzin a more likeable figure.[41] Reviewer Noel Kirkpatrick conceded that while the depiction of the relationship between the siblings was not the most interesting part of the show, it was “refreshing to see that these three middle-to late-middle-aged adults on a show aimed at kids have problems, too—problems that younger audiences can grasp and relate to, but that still ring true for older audiences who have siblings.”[42] Tenzin's stint as the teacher of the Air Nation at the Northern Air Temple drew comparisons with Hogwarts from the Harry Potter series with Tenzin being compared to both Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape.[43] Voice Actor J.K. Simmons has drawn praise for his work in portraying the sometimes contradictory nature of Tenzin's character.[43] Tenzin, Kya and Bumi's battle with the Red Lotus has been described as one of the best scenes in Book Three.[44] There was some angst among fans over the fate of Tenzin when it was not immediately clear whether Tenzin survived his battle with Zaheer and the rest of the Red Lotus gang, as Tenzin stubbornly refused to surrender despite being badly outnumbered.[45]Tenzin did receive criticism for at times not being a progressive enough character. For example, his support of the succession of King Wu to the throne of the Earth Kingdom, maintaining that nation's monarchy, drew some criticism.[46] Additionally, criticism was leveled at the show's creators for not having enough Tenzin appearances in Book Four, despite him being a major protagonist.[47]"

Bedwardism;"Bedwardism, more properly the Jamaica Native Baptist Free Church, was a religious movement of Jamaica.Bedwardism was founded in August Town, Saint Andrew Parish, in 1889 by Harrison "Shakespeare" Woods, an African-American emigrant to Jamaica, and named for Alexander Bedward (1848–1930[1]), who was referred to as "That Prophet" and "Shepherd." It was one of the most popular Afro-Jamaican politico-religious movements from the 1890s to the 1920s. Bedwardism attracted tens of thousands of followers with a call for social justice, as well as socioeconomic programs for the lower classes.Bedwardian literature describes Bedwardism as a new religion, the successor to Christianity and Judaism. Its actual teachings differ little from those of most Christian denominations, stressing the importance of recognizing Jesus Christ as both God and man in part of the Trinity, as well as frequent fasting.  Even so, because the movement likened the ruling classes to the Pharisees, it met with disapproval and even suppression by them. One of the few unique concepts of Bedwardism is the belief that August Town, Jamaica corresponds to Jerusalem for the Western world..[2][3][4][5]Bedward himself claimed at times to be the reincarnation of prophets including Moses, Jonah and John the Baptist, and was ruled insane by courts on two occasions.[6]The movement lost steam in 1921 after Bedward and hundreds of his followers marched into Kingston, where he failed to deliver on his claim to ascend into Heaven, and many were arrested. In 1930, Bedward died in his cell of natural causes.[7]Many of his followers became Garveyites and Rastafarians, bringing with them the experience of resisting the system and demanding changes of the colonial oppression and the perceived white oppression. Rastafari casts Marcus Garvey as a Messiah, while also casting Bedward in the role of John the Baptist."

Jaesusaeng;"Jaesusaeng (Korean: 재수생, Hanja: 再修生, lit. "restudy student") is a Korean term for high school students who decide to spend a year studying to re-take the College Scholastic Ability Test, hoping to get a higher score and enter the university of their choice.[1] Attending university has a major impact on their future careers.[2] The equivalent term in Japan is rōnin.Gaining entrance to the extremely competitive and prestigious SKY universities in Seoul requires that some students become jaesusaeng after an initial less-than-stellar performance on the national exam. Korea is "prepossessed by social status and reputation," and a SKY education is the main way to gain social status.[3]Generally, the public education system is not enough to prepare students for the exam, so most students attend after school lessons at various hagwon (cram schools). The fierce competition for enrollment at prestigious universities is called "entrance exam war" (입시전쟁, 入試戰爭, ipsi jeonjaeng).The stress from constant study and limited social life as a student have contributed to an increase in suicide in South Korea, for children aged 10 to 19 years old, suicide is the second most common cause of death in the country.[3]When a student fails to earn an adequate score over 3 or more years, he may be derisively referred to as a jangsusaeng (장수생, 長壽生, lit. literally "long life student") a play on words from the expression "Please live a long life" said to elders (장수 하세요). Beginning around 2010, the word "N susaeng" (엔수생, N壽生) is in common use, wherein the Chinese character jang (長, meaning "long") is replaced with the Latin letter N, which represents the undefined number of times the student is taking the test.This Korea-related article is a stub.

His family was repressed and exiled to Kazakhstan. He finished high school No. 23 in Grozny, Checheno-Ingushskaya ASSR. The school, completely destroyed during the First Chechen War, in 2005 was rebuilt with Gutseriev's financial support.[16][17][18][19]From 1982, Gutseriev worked as a process engineer, later on – as a senior process engineer of Grozny Production Association at the RSFSR Ministry of Local Industry, Grozny. He became CEO of the Association.[20] In 1991, Gutseriev was elected Chairman of Businessmen Association of Checheno-Ingush ASSR.[citation needed]In 1992, when Dzhokhar Dudayev took power, Gutseriev had to leave his business and moved to Moscow, where he founded industrial and financial company "BIN" (Bank of Investments and Innovations), uniting industrial, trading and financial enterprises. In 1993 he founded and headed the Joint Stock Commercial Bank BIN.[citation needed]1994 marked Gutseriev's development of the free economic zone for residents, the first one in the post Soviet countries, called the Zone of economic well-being Ingushetia (ZEWI). On 19 June 1994 the Government of the Russian Federation issued Resolution No. 740 on establishing ZEWI and appointed Gutseriev as the Head of its Financial sector.[citation needed]ZEWI received the legal right to return taxes paid to the federal budget back to the budget of the republic. According to the Federal Tax Service of Ingushetia, for the period from 1994 to 1997 that sum amounted to 1 billion 388 million denominated rubles. The financial corporation "BIN", being the official agent of the government of Ingushetia, was engaged in the registration of enterprises in the zone of economic favor. All financial flows of the Ingushetia free economic zone were accumulated on the accounts of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ingushetia and were controlled by the federal and republican tax authorities. ZEWI existed until July 3, 1997.[citation needed]However, in August 1997, in order to complete the construction of ZEWI facilities Gutseriev created the Center for Entrepreneurship Development (CED). During the operation of the CED, large infrastructure facilities were put into operation, in particular, water supply networks for settlements in Ingushetia, external engineering networks for a gas turbine power plant, sections of gas pipelines and roads that were important for the economic infrastructure of Ingushetia. In addition, thanks to the efforts of the CED, the construction of a number of residential buildings and the government complex in Magas were completed, and other social and industrial facilities were built. The main investor of the CED was Mikhail Gutseriev.[21]In 1981, Mikhail Gutseriev graduated from the Dzhambul Technological Institute of Light and Food Industry with a degree in “Leather and Fur Technology”.

In 1996 Mikhail Gutseriev initiated, developed and proposed for consideration of the State Duma a regulation on establishing a "Center for International Business", a standard offshore zone for non-residents. The State Duma approved the Federal Law on the "Center for International Business" (No. 16-FZ), with the major provisions compiling with general regulations of the laws on international businesses. The president approved the Law on 30 January 1996. The Law was effective for 1 year and international non-residents started their registration. The economic crisis of 1998, a strong decline in the Ruble exchange rate, and further default made the government suspend the effect of the law which has been in a "sleeping mode" so far.[citation needed]In 1999 for the second time Gutseriev was elected a State Duma Deputy for the Third Convocation of the Federal Assembly. However, on 14 January 2000, Gutseriev was elected as the President of Slavneft at the extraordinary meeting of shareholders of the company and had to turn down the Deputy's mandate.[citation needed]Gutseriev is the author of a monograph and an array of research publications on free economic free economic zones and offshore business issues in Russia.[24]On 27 February 2001, Gutseriev was elected the Vice President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.[25]In 2002 the stocks of Slavneft were sold to Sibneft Consortium (now Gazpromneft) and Tyumen Oil Company for US$1.86 bn, and Gutseriev established and became a head of OJSC NK “RussNeft” in 2002. The stocks of Slavneft were sold at knockdown prices.[2]In September 2002, Gutseriev founded and ran RussNeft, the oil and gas company.[citation needed]In 2006 he was accused of tax evasion, forcing him to sell RussNeft at a fraction of its value, before fleeing to London, due to fears of persecution and legal repercussions in Russia.[26]In the end of July 2007 Gutseriev in an open letter announced that authorities made an unprecedented pressure on him, and he was forced to sell RussNeft to the Basic Element holding, owned by loyal to the Kremlin Oleg Deripaska. Gutseriev stepped down as a President of RussNeft and announced his suspension of entrepreneurial activity (apart from RussNeft he owned Russian coal and many other companies) and his decision to move on to scientific endeavor.[27][28]On 28 August 2007 The Tverskoy court of Moscow issued arrest warrant in absentia for Gutseriev, meeting the request of the Investigative Committee under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Russia issues an international arrest warrant for Gutseriev.[29][30] At that moment Gutseriev had already been in London, having got US$3 billion from Oleg Deripaska from the RussNeft sale.[31]On 16 October 2007 Gutseriev applied for political asylum to the Border and Immigration Agency of the Home Office[32][33] but this information was officially refuted.[34]Near the end of October 2010, the Investigative Committee varied the preventive measure for Gutseriev from arrest in absentia on undertaking not to leave his usual place of residence.[35]In January 2010 Gutseriev regained his control over the 100% of the oil company. By the mid-April 2010 all the charges against Gutseriev were dropped, the criminal cases were dismissed. In April 2010 it was announced that Gutseriev has sold 49% of the company to Joint-Stock Financial Corporation Sistema and 2% more to Sberbank of Russia.[36]On 7 May 2010, Gutseriev came back to Russia in order to visit the tombs of his parents and son.[37][38][39]In the summer of 2013 Mikhail Gutseriev once again became the sole owner of JSC RussNeft.[40]In February 2015, bearing in mind massive expansion of the business of the two of his major oil companies JSC RussNeft and JSC Neftisa, he became the chairman of the board of directors both companies, having focused on the strategic management of his assets.[41]After the European Union introduced sanctions against Gutseriev in 2021, he resigned from the board of directors of RussNeft, and sold control in Neftisa to his younger brother Sait-Salam.[42][43]Between 1996 and 2006, Gutseriev played a key role in helping the Russian special services to release a large number of hostages kidnapped in the North Caucasus by various criminal groups.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50] Thus, according to the memoirs of A. Kh. Amirkhanov, M. S. Gutseriev, being at that time the Vice-Speaker of the State Duma, "was the principal liaison in all negotiations and all special operations for the release of hostages." In particular, thanks to Gutseriev's activities, the following people were rescued from captivity: Slovak construction person Imrich Rigo (kidnapped on October 10, 1996, released on February 14, 1997), director of the Swiss firm Seibert-Stinnes Robert Hill (kidnapped on February 2, 1997, released on July 2, 1997) and director of a brick factory from Serbia Milan Evtic (kidnapped in December 1997). Gutseriev also "played a decisive role" in the release of Stanislav Taslitsky, the head of the construction of a water pipeline in Ingushetia, and the banker Viktor Morgun, from the captivity.[44]On May 1, 1998, Valentin Vlasov, the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Government of the Russian Federation in the Chechen Republic, was captured by a group of Chechen militants on the Rostov-Baku highway.[51][52][53] Being aware of his successful experience of the hostages release, officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia appealed to Gutseriev to help organize the negotiation process. According to the memoirs of the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation (1998-1999) and the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation (1999) Sergey Stepashin, the negotiation process was led by Gutseriev, thanks to whom it was possible to determine the location of Vlasov. Thanks to a special operation conducted under the leadership of Deputy Interior Minister V. Rushailo, on November 13, 1998, V. Vlasov was released. According to Stepashin, Gutseriev refused a state award for this special operation.[44]On January 29, 1998, in Vladikavkaz, a French citizen, representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Vincent Cochetel, was kidnapped. From Moscow, the operation to liberate Cochetel was led by Interior Minister S. Stepashin, and the negotiations and all contacts were conducted by Gutseriev. On December 12, 1998, Vincent Cochetel was released as a result of a special operation carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation with the participation of  RF Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Vladimir Rushailo and Mikhail Gutseriev. For this operation, Stepashin was awarded the Order of the Commander of the Legion of Honor by French President Jacques Chirac. According to S. Stepashin, "this award is our joint one with Mikhail Gutseriev, although, as I have already said, he treated the orders quite philosophically".[44]In addition, it is known about the participation of M. Gutseriev in organizing the release from captivity of the captain of the Russian Armed Forces Vitaly Korotin, major of the North Caucasian RUBOP of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Vitaly Khapov and five employees of the regiment of the patrol and guard service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Gutseriev also took part in the successful release of five women who were fraudulently lured to Chechnya and abducted. Besides, Gutseriev was among those who rescued from captivity Ilez Deniev, a religious figure and the son of Sheikh Deni Arsanov.[44]In early 1999, S. Stepashin asked Gutseriev to help  rescue the servants of the Russian Orthodox Church, Peter Makarov and Sergei Potapov. They were released in May of the same year along with five Russian servicemen.[44]In 1999, during the assault of Grozny by the armed forces, Gutseriev managed to agree with war lords upon the evacuation of about 90 people living in a nursing home in the Staropromyslovsky district of the capital of the Chechen Republic.[44]On October 4, 1999, Dmitry Balburov, a journalist of the Moscow News, was kidnapped in Chechnya. Gutseriev took part in his release.On September 1, 2004, terrorists took hostages at school No. 1 in Beslan. In the evening of the same day, the operational headquarters organized to rescue the hostages decided to involve Gutseriev in the negotiation process. On the morning of September 2, 2004, Gutseriev came into contact with terrorists and began negotiations. He obtained a number of concessions from the terrorists, namely to accept supplies of drinking water for children, to evacuate the bodies of the hostages they killed and to release 26 people (24 children were taken out from the school). During the negotiations Gutseriev offered himself as a hostage, asking to release the children, but the terrorists refused. According to the memoirs of A. Kh. Amirkhanov, after Beslan, Basayev said that Gutseriev "deceived the mujahideen in Beslan, telling them that there would definitely not be an assault, and persuaded them to let the Ministry of Emergency Situations car with special forces near the building. […]  We will make him choke on his own blood and feel all its bitterness." Many of the hostages were not rescued. Nevertheless, according to the conclusion of the commission for evaluation of the operational headquarters actions, “the involvement of reputable members of the Ingush diaspora Gutseriev and Aushev in the negotiations was a timely measure, adequate to the current situation”.[44]In 2006, at the request of the authorities, Gutseriev was again involved in the negotiation process and helped to release a member of the Ingush parliament, Magomed Chakhkiev.[44]For many years of work on the release of kidnapping and hostage-taking victims, Gutseriev was repeatedly offered various state orders and medals, but he always refused them with the words: “I just fulfilled my civic duty. And on human grief, I won't hang a medal on my chest[44]".Gutseriev is the biggest owner of the commercial real estate on Tverskaya Street in Moscow.[54]Development of industrial companies owned by Gutseriev allowed purchasing new assets leading to business great diversification. With the pursue of efficient management of the assets portfolio, the businessman established AO Safmar Group, a managing company. Gutseriev became a head of the Group's Board who defines the development strategy of the holding. Within the period from 2015 to 2020 Safmar was joined by large electronic retailers M.Video and Eldorado,[55] coal mining enterprises Kuzbasskaya Toplivnaya Company,[56] Krasnoyarskrayugol, etc., oil companies (Sladkovsko-Zarechnoye located in Orenburg region[57]), refineries (Afipsky Refinery[58]), a number of construction and development holdings (A101), major logistics operators (MLP, etc.), non-government pension funds, leasing and insurance companies.Gutseriev has been implementing business projects in Belarus since 2000, when he was appointed by the governments of Russia and Belarus as president of Slavneft, the Russian and Belarusian state oil and gas company. Lead my him, Slavneft upgraded Mozyr Oil Refinery, which became part of the company. After Slavneft became private and was sold to TNK-BP and Sibneft, Gutseriev resigned from the position of president of Slavneft. In 2005 in order to increase export opportunities, RussNeft, established by Gutseriev, built an oil loading railway terminal in Bryansk region to deliver raw materials to Belarus, Ukraine, the Baltic States and Eastern Europe.[citation needed]In 2011, Gutseriev's Slavkali company signed an investment agreement with the government of Belarus, according to which $2 billion was to be invested in the construction of Nezhinsky MPP at a potassium site near the city of Lyuban, 150 km from Minsk. The agreement also provides commitments to invest $250 million into social and economic infrastructure projects of Belarus, some of which, worth $180 million, have already been implemented: the Renaissance hotel, managed by the American company Marriott, the office center, business aviation terminal in major airport and Krasnoselskoye recreation estate for personal needs and recreation of employees.[citation needed]In July 2017, the construction of the plant started.[citation needed]In January and February 2020, during another “oil conflict” between Minsk and Moscow, Gutseriev's oil companies were the only companies which, before signing contracts with major suppliers, ensured the sale of Russian oil to Belarus. At the same time, the volume of supplies was about 500 thous. tons per month, which accounted for 25% of the total volume of oil supplies to Belarus. At the same time, in order to maintain the balance of oil products and the needs of the population, in addition to Gutseriev's companies, oil was supplied to Belarus by the Azerbaijani state company SOCAR, the national oil company of Saudi Arabia Saudi Aramco, and mining companies in Norway. US Secretary of State Michael Popmeo at a meeting with President of Belarus A. Lukashenko said that the United States is ready to fully meet the country's needs in raw materials.[citation needed]Gutseriev is the owner of GCM Global Energy Inc., the British company, which produces oil in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.[citation needed]In 2010 Gutseriev became the key player in the broadcasting market of the Russian Federation, owning a total of eight Media and Radio stations.[59][60]In June 2012 he acquired broadcasting stations "Просто Радио" (Moscow, 94 FM) and "Dobriye Pesni" (Moscow, 94.4 FM) from Alexander Lebedev.[61] In January 2013 it became known that 75% of the shares of Krutoy Media Holding (Love Radio, Radio Dacha and Taxi FM) were purchased by Gutseriev while the remaining 25%  were kept by Igor Krutoy.[62][60] In November 2013 he acquired Finam FM Broadcasting station (Moscow, 99.6 FM),[63] which together with"Vostok FM" and "Vesna FM" formed Izyum Holding.[59] In January 2017 Mikhail Gutseriev became an owner of Bridge Media Group, one of the largest television holdings of the country that includes number of the popular music channels.[64]Gutseriev is married and has two sons (Chingiz, Said) and a daughter (Sofya).[65][66][67] His elder son Chingiz died from a brain hemorrhage after crashing his Ferrari in 2007.[68][69][70] Gutseriev's other son, Said, is a businessperson. In 2016, Said held a wedding that reportedly cost $1 billion.[71]The younger brother of Mikhail, Sait-Salam (born 1959) is a businessman. Mikhail transferred his Rossneft stake to Sait-Salam when he was placed under sanctions.[72]Gutseriev is involved in poetry writing and song writing.[73][74]In 2020 during the pandemic Gutseriev offered Moscow authorities the use of his hotels to fight the coronavirus.[75]"
WGNS;"WGNS is a radio station based in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, United States. The station operates at 1450 kHz on the AM dial.

William Gaunt;"William Charles Anthony Gaunt (born 3 April 1937 in Pudsey, West Riding of Yorkshire) is an English actor.[1] He became widely known for television roles such as Richard Barrett in The Champions (1968–1969), Arthur Crabtree in No Place Like Home (1983–87) and Andrew Prentice in Next of Kin (1995–97). He has had many other roles on television and also an extensive stage career as an actor and director, including performances with the Royal Shakespeare Company.Gaunt's father was a solicitor. Gaunt attended Giggleswick School and Baylor University, Texas, and then the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He then spent three years working in repertory theatre at Worthing, Bath, Salisbury and Cheltenham after which he was in America for another year, later returning to the UK working on productions at Birmingham, Coventry and Cheltenham, interrupted by a spell in the army.After minor roles in 1960s series such as Z-Cars and The Avengers, and the Edgar Wallace Mysteries films The Sinister Man (1961) and Solo for Sparrow (1962), he gained a role as the super-powered secret agent Richard Barrett in the 1968 British espionage/science fiction series The Champions. In 1966 he appeared in "Flight Plan", an episode of The Saint, where he played an Osprey pilot. He had also appeared in a recurring role in Sergeant Cork following policemen in Victorian London.Between 1983 and 1987, he starred as harassed father Arthur Crabtree in the sitcom No Place Like Home.

Zimmern Chronicle;"The Zimmern Chronicle (German: Zimmerische Chronik or Chronik der Grafen von Zimmern) is a family chronicle describing the lineage and history of the noble family of Zimmern, based in Meßkirch, Germany. It was written in a Swabian variety of Early New High German by Count Froben Christoph of Zimmern (1519–1566). The chronicle is an eminent historical source of information about 16th century nobility in South-West Germany, its culture and its values. It is also an important literary and ethnological source for its many folkloristic texts. The text has survived in two manuscripts, both in possession of the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart.When the anonymous, unpublished chronicle was rediscovered in the 19th century, historians were not sure about the identity of the author (most of the chronicle is written in the third person, while at some times the writer slips into the first person). While some considered the author to be the famous law scholar and Imperial judge, Wilhelm Werner von Zimmern (Froben Christopher's uncle), others believed count Froben Christopher and his secretary Johannes Müller († c. 1600) to be the writers. In 1959, Beat Rudolf Jenny proved in his thoroughly researched book that Froben Christopher is the sole author of the chronicle. However, Wilhelm Werner's influence on his nephew is palpable in some passages.Writing or ordering a genealogy was a rather common form of representation for Germany's noble families of the time. However, the Zimmern chronicle surpasses other contemporary texts in both volume and scope. It is a compilation of many types of texts, including simple genealogical information, psychologically rich biographies of ancestors and members of other noble families, fables, schwanks (droll stories) and facetiae (comic and/or erotic short stories).The purpose of the work is probably twofold: Firstly, Froben Christopher wanted to prove the nobility of his family and to preserve that knowledge to posterity. Secondly, the chronicle was a means to educate future family members. The author does not only tell the stories of shining examples of nobility, but he also gives proof of bad examples. He clearly condemns some of his more spendthrift ancestors for selling family goods and hence giving away economic and political power.The Zimmern Chronicle begins with the history of the Cimbri, an ancient Germanic tribe, and tells the story of the Cimbri's forced relocation to the Black Forest under the reign of Charlemagne. While the link between the Cimbri and the Zimmern family is fictional and only induced by the similar-sounding name, Froben recounts several episodes woven into a stream of historical information to prove it. The work also includes a complete fictional genealogy starting in the 10th century. Historical evidence is entered with the first actually known family member, Konrad von Zimmern, abbot of Reichenau Abbey from c. 1234 to 1255. Starting with the early 14th century, the genealogical and historical parts of the Zimmern Chronicle are finally reduced to facts. Still, Froben inserts entertaining stories to enliven his characterizations and to prove his political points.In 1540, Froben Christopher had written the genealogical "Liber rerum Cimbriacarum" whose structure shows many resemblances to the later work.The beginnings of the chronicle as we know it today lie probably in the year 1559, and it was not even finished at Froben Christopher's death in 1566.Two manuscripts were written by secretary Johannes Müller at Froben Christopher's chancellery at Meßkirch Castle:With the Zimmern family expiring with the death of Froben Christopher's only male heir Wilhelm von Zimmern as early as 1594, the work never materialized as the memorial and textbook that it was originally intended to become. The chronicle manuscripts eventually wound up in the possession of the counts of  Fürstenberg, probably via Appolonia von Helfenstein, a daughter of Froben Christopher's. The books were stored for nearly four centuries in the Fürstenbergische Hofbibliothek at Donaueschingen, until that library was sold and scattered by the princes of Fürstenberg for financial reasons in 1993. Since 1993, the manuscripts are in possession of the Wurttemberg State Library (Württembergische Landesbibliothek) in Stuttgart.An archivist named Doeppner rediscovered the chronicle around 1776, but it was the literary scholar and author Joseph von Laßberg who made the text known among scholars and historians by using parts of it in his anthology "Liedersaal". Laßberg's friend Josef Albrecht von Ittner used plots from the chronicle for his own novellas. Laßberg also influenced Friedrich von der Hagen who used parts of the chronicle for his edition of German medieval literature, Minnesinger (1838), and Josef Eiselein who used the chronicle as a source for his collection of German proverbs (1840). Several monographs on regional history in these years used the chronicle as a source: Ernst Münch's history of the house of Fürstenberg (1829), Krieg von Hochfelden's history of the counts of Eberstein (1836), Ruckgaber's history of the counts of Zimmern (1840), and Vanotti's history of the counts of Montfort and Werdenberg (1845). Ludwig Uhland took some plots from the chronicle for his collection of folk tales.In 1869, Karl August Barack published the first printed edition of the chronicle and hence made it finally available to the public. A revised version of this edition was published in 1882, a further reprint in 1932. Barack's revised edition is the only complete edition and is still widely used. However, Barack did not retain the original sequence of the manuscript and wove Froben Christopher's addenda into the main text, thus giving the lively tale an air of verbosity. This deluded later scholars in both questioning the author's literary abilities and scorning the factual content of the work which now much more resembled a collection of short droll stories than a serious work of genealogy and history.A new edition was started in the 1960s by Hansmartin Decker-Hauff and Rudolf Seigel, retaining the original sequence of texts in manuscript B. This edition has remained unfinished. Only three volumes have appeared.Manuscript 580 is available as a digitized version at the website of the Stuttgart library.[1] The revised Barack edition is available as a digitized version at the website of the University Library of Freiburg. Since 2006, an electronic text of that edition is available at Wikimedia's German Wikisource project (see External links).Modern German renarrations of some parts of the chronicle have been published in 1911, 1940, 1988, 1996 and 1997."

Chalcolestes parvidens;"Lestes parvidens Artobelevski 1929Chalcolestes parvidens, formerly Lestes parvidens,[1] is a damselfly of the family Lestidae. It has a metallic green body and at rest it holds its wings away from its body. Its common name in English is the eastern willow spreadwing.[2]The genus Chalcolestes is separated from Lestes because of differences in their larvae. C. parvidens is closely related to C. viridis and used to be considered a subspecies of C. viridis, however there are small morphological differences between the two species both as adults and larvae and analysis of proteins from the two species, by electrophoresis, also supports their separation into two species, but they are hard to tell apart in the field.Chalcolestes parvidens is found in eastern and central Europe, in Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Turkey. It is found on islands in the eastern Mediterranean, on Cyprus, Corsica, Crete and Sicily. In Italy and the Balkans both C. parvidens and C. viridis occur together. It is only in the last 20 years that odonaterists have been separating C. parvidens from C. viridis so some of the older records for C. viridis will probably be for C. parvidens.In the field it is not possible to reliably distinguish C. viridis from C. parvidens. Both species are mainly metallic green, like the Lestes damselflies, but larger and darker but they do not have a powder blue pruinescence which is common in Lestes. The pterostigma is pale brown and outlined in black. The thorax has thin yellow antehumerals and broader yellow stripe above a thin black line on each side, the upper edge of the stripe is irregular. Both C. viridis and C. parvidens have a prominent spur-like marking on the side of the thorax.Flight period is generally from May to November. In Cyprus, the flight season is from early April to January.[3]Behaviour is similar to that described in C. viridis. It hangs with wings spread wide, often in the shade of trees near breeding water.[4] Mature males defend vertical territories in marginal shrubs and small trees where they find and mate with females in the normal damselfly manner forming the wheel position. Egg laying occurs with the pair in tandem, the eggs being laid into incisions in the bark of overhanging branches, not into submerged vegetation as is the case in many damselflies.  Egg laying can result in distinct oval galls forming in the shrub's bark. The eggs develop rapidly for a few weeks and then enter a diapause state. In this state the eggs development is very slow and it is in this state that the eggs overwinter. The following spring the eggs hatch, the larvae drop into the water and start to develop. Growth is rapid and adults can emerge in a couple of months. After emerging the adults move away from water to mature. In this stage of their life-cycle which in C. parvidens is quite long, the immature adults cannot breed. The adults need a period of time for their reproductive organs to develop and this non-breeding period also stops the adults breeding too early in the season. If the females lay eggs early in the year the eggs will develop when it is to warm to for them to enter diapause. They might hatch out before winter and the resultant larva will die when winter temperatures occur. When fully mature the adults return to water and start breeding."

Mantonico bianco;"Mantonico bianco is a white Italian wine grape variety grown in the Calabria wine region of southern Italy. The grape should not be confused with the similarly named Calabrian grape Montonico bianco or with Guardavalle, which is known as Mantonico in the province of Cosenza in Calabria. In the early 21st century, DNA profiling suggested that Mantonico bianco may be one of the parent varieties of the red Calabrian grape Gaglioppo which is also known as Mantonico nero.[1]Today Mantonico bianco is used to make both dry varietal and sweet passito-style dessert wines under several Calabrian Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) designations. The grape is also potentially one of the permitted varieties in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Bivongi and Donnici, however, the regulations for those DOCs do not differentiate between Mantonico bianco and Montonico bianco with the later most often being used in those wines.[1]A Mantonico vine growing in Calabria was documented in the 1601 work of the Italian writer Girolamo Marafioti, who grew up in the commune of Polistena in Calabria, then part of the Kingdom of Naples. Ampelographers believe that this is the earliest mention of Mantonico bianco and that the grape is probably a native of the district of Locri in Reggio Calabria.[1]Over the years, Mantonico bianco has often been confused with other similarly named Calabrian grapes, including Montonico bianco and Guardavalle, which shares the synonym of Mantonico in the Cozenza province. It was also once thought that the grape was potentially a white-berried color mutation of one of the several varieties that are known as Mantonico nero, including Gaglioppo. While DNA analysis has shown that Mantonico bianco is not a color mutation, it has suggested a close relationship between the grape and Gaglioppo, with Mantonico bianco being potentially one of the parent varieties of the red Calabrian grape. Further DNA evidence suggests that Mantonico bianco may also be a parent variety of the Marchione grape of Apulia and the Sicilian grape Nerello Mascalese.[1]Even in the very warm climate of southern Italy, Mantonico bianco is late ripening and often one of the last varieties to be harvested in a growing season. The grape has strong resistance to many viticultural hazards including downy and powdery mildew.[1]Mantonico bianco is grown almost exclusively in Calabria with most plantings found along Calabria's coastline on Ionian Sea, particularly around the seaside communes of Bianco and Casignana. Here the grape is used in the production of IGT wines in both dry and passito-style wines either as a varietal or part of a blend.[1]Mantonico bianco can potentially be used in the DOC wines of Bivongi in the Vallata dello Stilaro of Reggio Calabria and Donnici on the La Sila plateau in the province of Cosenza but the DOC regulations do not differentiate Mantonico bianco from Montonico bianco with most producers using only the later variety in those wines.[1]According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Mantonico bianco has the potential to produce dry and sweet wines with a wide range of aroma profiles from floral to herbal to mineral with some examples having "exotic fruit" notes.[1]Over the years, Mantonico bianco has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Mantonacu, Mantonica vera, Mantonico Maclugnese, Mantonico vero, Mantonicu Pizzutella, Mantonicu vera and Mantonacu Viru della Locride.[1][2]"

Seán Burke (author);"Seán Burke is a literary theorist and novelist. His work as a theorist challenges the postmodern displacement of the self and reintroduces the author as a central concept in contemporary thought. Burke’s fiction explores themes of alienation and addiction in claustrophobic settings such as the old Tiger Bay of his native Cardiff. Burke was born to an Irish family in Cardiff, Wales in 1961. He studied English and Philosophy at the University of Kent and received a Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1989. He was Reader in English Studies at the University of Durham where he taught from 1992-2006 and has since worked as a freelance writerAt a time when continental theorists and philosophers were heralding the death of the author as a twentieth-century event analogous to the death of God, Burke argued that anti-authorial discourses were contradictory and self-defeating. His first book, The Death and Return of the Author demonstrated through close readings and philosophical analysis that the concept of the author nonetheless remained profoundly active in theoretical discourses which promulgated the death of the author. Burke’s project of ‘the return of the author’ was developed in Authorship: From Plato to the Postmodern and The Ethics of Writing, the latter book arguing that authors can be held responsible not only for intended but also unintended consequences of their work.Burke’s first novel, Deadwater, a Cardiff-set work of literary noir, was widely praised upon publication for its evocation of a docklands’ community in terminal decline.[1] The novel has appeared in French translation and was optioned as a film by Rising Tide Productions. His second novel, The Englishwoman, concerning a young woman who voluntarily enters into a jihadist hostage situation, came out in May 2021.[2]The Death and Return of the Author was positively reviewed within a week of publication in 1992 by James Wood who wrote: ‘This very distinguished book is that mixture of rigour and plainness in theory that readers who care about the author have been awaiting.’[3]  Now regarded as a classic, The Death and Return of the Author has gone through expanded second and third editions in 1998 and 2009 and is credited with reopening the field of author studies for an age of theory. As Brian Vickers said: ‘The whole concept of the death of the author has been finally put to rest by Seán Burke.’[4]"

Fortunato Abat;"Fortunato Abat KCM (June 10, 1925 – March 7, 2018) was a Filipino major general who served as the 20th Secretary of the Department of National Defense (DND), Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, and Commanding General of the Philippine Army.Fortunato Abat was born on June 10 in San Juan, La Union.  He studied in Singalong Elementary School in the city of Manila from 1932 to 1939, then in Araullo High School, 1939–41.  His secondary education was abruptly halted by the Japanese invasion during World War II. As a young teenager, he entered the Philippine Army which was incorporated into the United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) as an enlisted man on April 15, 1944, before the Allied Liberation of the Philippines. He continued his secondary education in La Union High School even after World War II and completed his education in the year 1947.[1][2]Abat entered the Philippine Military Academy right after finishing his high school diploma, and graduated in the Class of '51, and was commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant in the Philippine Army.  Along with 2nd Lieutenant Fidel V. Ramos, Abat joined the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK), where he served with distinction under the United Nations flag.[1]Abat's colorful military career brought him to become the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations & Training of the 1st Infantry (Tabak) Division.  Later on he became the Senior Armed Forces Attache at the Philippine Embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  He also was sent with the Philippine Delegation to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Meetings of SEATO Intelligence Assessment Committee in Bangkok, Thailand.[2]He also distinguished himself as Commanding Officer of the 3rd Infantry Brigade (Separate), and later on as the Commanding General of the 3rd Infantry Division, and Central Mindanao Command (CEMCOM).[2]Maj. Gen. Abat finally served as Commanding General of the Philippine Army from March 28, 1976, to March 28, 1981.[1]  Tragedy befell the family of Maj. Gen. Abat, when his son, 2Lt. Tito B. Abat, died during an encounter with the New People's Army in Eastern Samar, a year after graduating from the Philippine Military Academy.Immediately after his retirement from active military service, he joined the Ministry of Human Settlements. A few months later, he was named Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China where he served from May 1981 until after EDSA Revolution in April 1986.[1]Upon his return from his Ambassadorship in PROC, Abat was first appointed as the Administrator of the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office (PVAO), a DND agency. Later on, he was named Undersecretary of National Defense (USND) during the term of Defense Secretary Rafael Ileto. He also served as USND during the term of then Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos, but he left the department and was designated Deputy Director General to Secretary Rafael Ileto who later headed the National Security Council (NSC).[1]During the presidency of Fidel Ramos, Abat was the Chairman of the Peace Panel of the Philippine Government during the negotiations with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which led to signing of a peace treaty on July 18, 1997, ending the three decade old armed hostilities between the Republic of the Philippines and the MILF.[1] He also served as the 20th Secretary of the Department of National Defense from September 16, 1997, to June 30, 1998.[1]During the height of the impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada, Abat along with his colleagues in the Association of General and Flag Officers (AGFO) called for the resignation of the President through a Manifesto.[3]Abat finally was appointed as the President & CEO of the John Hay Poro Point Development Corp. by Pres. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.[4]Despite in retirement, Abat has continued to play a role in Philippine politics, without escaping controversy.  Abat, who formed the National Coalition for Solidarity (NCS) and the Movement for National Salvation (MVS) called on for the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.[5]In December 2005, Abat was arrested after he called on the formation of a revolutionary government, of which he is the new President of the Philippines, and called on the resignation of Pres. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in view of the latter's allegations of corruption.[6]On August 15, 2006, Abat called for the abolishment of the Philippine Government and the Philippine Constitution, and the creation of a "Transition Government" of "Discipline and Authoritative Governance" where "All the three (3) branches of government are collectively responsible and accountable to the President that has oversight power over the discharge of their functions and responsibilities. Focus of governance. Governance is focused on the civil service and the military and police service."[7]"

Silverton Mountain;"Silverton Mountain is a ski area near Silverton, Colorado, United States that opened on January 19, 2002.[1] Popular with skiers and snowboarders, Silverton Mountain has one chairlift that carries visitors into its terrain, which is for advanced and expert skiers or riders. Avalanche gear is required to ride the lift at all times due to the unpatrolled and ungroomed nature of Silverton. In addition to Silverton Mountain's 1,819 acres of lift accessed skiing, Silverton also serves as a base area for over 22,000 acres of helicopter accessed skiing.[2] Uniquely, Silverton is only open Thursday through Sunday from December through April.Silverton Mountain is located in San Juan County, just six miles from the historic mining town of Silverton, Colorado. The ski area is best known for adventure, powder and steep terrain. At 13,487 feet, it is North America's highest and, according to its website, most expert ski area.[3]The mountain boasts 1,819 acres of lift accessed terrain and over 22,000 acres of hike to and helicopter accessed terrain. There are no groomed runs and no cut trails. Skiers and snowboarders can access some of the best powder skiing in the world. Due to the high elevation of the San Juan Mountains and limited number of daily skiers the snow quality is typically very good.During certain times of year the ski area only allows guided skiing. Guides are provided by Silverton Mountain. Each guided group of eight skiers or less can expect to typically hike between 5 and 45 minutes to access runs. However, some runs drop straight from the chair lift. Hiking 15 minutes to an hour allows access to large open bowls and steep, tight chutes.Avalanche safety equipment is required to be worn by every skier and rider. Required equipment includes, avalanche beacon, shovel, and probe. These items are available for rent from Silverton Mountain. Reservations are highly recommended for guided skiing as the mountain does book up. Guides are also available during the unguided season.On January 14, 2012  25-year-old Sydney Elizabeth Owens was skiing the "Riff" run with a guide when she fell and slid 1,500 feet down the mountain. Ski patrol attempted to revive her but she was pronounced dead when the ambulance arrived. This was her first run of the day and the fall was blamed on a binding failure.[4]Silverton Mountain is the only operation in the contiguous United States to offer heli skiing by the drop. Silverton Mountain heli accessed terrain is designated for advanced and expert skiers and snowboarders only.Silverton Mountain was founded by Aaron and Jen Brill and opened for business on January 19, 2002 with one double chair that had been purchased from Mammoth Mountain Ski Area. Known for lift accessed backcountry skiing, Silverton Mountain also maintains educational programs such as Avalanche Level I, Avalanche Level II, and Backcountry 101. The ski area is designed to have minimal impact on the environment. Based purely on skiing and not on development Silverton Mountain has no plans of building condos or high-speed chairlifts.[5]  Voted Best of the West: Skiing in Colorado, Utah, California and Nevada for Extreme Terrain by USA Today.[6]Bloomberg TV "Skiers Tempt Fate on Exclusive Expert-Only Mountain"Warren Miller "Children of Winter"Matchstick Productions "Attack of La Nina"Teton Gravity Research "The Dream Factory""

Seboyeta, New Mexico;"Seboyeta is a census-designated place  in Cibola County, New Mexico, United States. Its population was 179 as of the 2010 census. Seboyeta had a post office from February 5, 1885, to January 7, 1995.[5]In 1746, Padre Juan Menchero persuaded several hundred members of the Navajo Tribe to settle at Cebolleta.  A mission was established for the purpose of converting the Navajo to Christianity.  The community was formally established in 1749, under the name of "Cebolleta", a word meaning "little onion."[4]  It was named for the nearby Cebolleta Mountains, now called the San Mateo Mountains.  But in 1750, the Navajo rejected the efforts and returned to their own lands.On January 23, 1800, Governor Fernando Chacon granted a request by Francisco Aragon and twenty-nine others who wished to settle at Cebolleta and establish a town there.  Chacon ordered Alcalde Jose Manuel Aragon of the Pueblo of Laguna to formally transfer the approved area to the receivers of the grant.  As New Mexico was still under the control of Spain, and the Alcalde was appointed by the Spanish king, this order had the force of a royal command.[6]The colonists had been granted an area bordered “On the north, by the San Mateo Mountains, on the east, by the Zia Road and Pedro Padilla Valley, on the south, by the Mesa del Bagilan, which adjoins the Paquate ranch, and on the west, by the San Mateo Mountains.”In 1801, the Navajo returned, believing the land to be theirs, and forced the colonists to leave.  They fled to Chihuahua, in New Spain.In 1803, the colonists were forced by the Spanish government to return to Cebolleta and ordered to remain there under penalty of death.  They had accepted a grant from the Spanish king and no legal right to abandon it.In 1805, the Navajo again attacked the settlement.  This second attack would have ended in a massacre, but the Laguna Tribe came to the defense of the colonists.  In gratitude, the inhabitants of the Town of Cebolleta, recognized the Laguna claim to certain lands to the south, known as the Rancho de Paquate, which the colonists had previously considered their own.  To smooth the negotiations, Laguna agreed to purchase the houses, barns, and other improvements the colonists had made to these lands.  In 1826, after control of New Mexico had passed from Spain to the newly formed nation of Mexico, Governor Antonio Narbona formally approved the agreement with a grant to the Laguna Pueblo.In 1846, control of New Mexico passed to the United States.  A military post was established at Cebolleta in 1849, but in 1862, General Edward Canby ordered this post moved to San Rafael, New Mexico, in 1862 and it was renamed Fort Wingate.[7]In 1859, the heirs of the original Spanish land grant, petitioned the United States government, in the person of Surveyor General William Pelham to recognize their claims to the land.  Pelham agreed to the terms of the petition, but formal recognition required the approval of Congress.  The outbreak of the Civil War delayed these proceedings until 1869.  A formal patent, approving the claim, was issued on January 27, 1882.[6]In 1885, a post office was established for the town.  There were already several places using the name "Cebolleta" in the Post Office directory, so the variant spelling of Seboyeta was used instead.[8]"

Helicoprionidae;"The Helicoprionidae, also known as the Agassizodontidae are an extinct, poorly known family of bizarre holocephalids within the poorly understood order Eugeneodontida.  Members of the Helicoprionidae possessed a unique "tooth-whorl" on the symphysis of the lower jaw and pectoral fins supported by long radials.[2]  The closest living relatives of the Helicoprionidae and all other eugeneodontids are the ratfishes. The anatomy of the tooth-whorl differed amongst genus and species, some possessing complete spirals (such as those of Helicoprion), others possessing halved spirals (seen in Parahelicoprion), and some with wedged half-spirals (seen in Sarcoprion). Each tooth-whorl is thought to be adapted to a different type of prey, and a different predation strategy.[3]This article about a prehistoric shark is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

Eurasian scops owl;"Strix scops Linnaeus, 1758Scops giu (Scop. 1766)[3]The Eurasian scops owl (Otus scops), also known as the European scops owl or just scops owl, is a small owl in the typical owl family Strigidae. Its breeding range extends from southern Europe eastwards to southern Siberia and the western Himalayas. It is migratory, wintering in Africa south of the Sahara.The Eurasian scops owl was formally described by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. Linnaeus cited the 1599 description by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi, placed it with all the other owls in the genus Strix and coined the binomial name Strix scops.[4][5] The Eurasian scops owl is now placed in the genus Otus that was introduced in 1769 by Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant.[6][7] The genus name is derived from the Latin otus meaning "eared owl". The specific epithet scops is from the Ancient Greek word skōps for a little eared owl.[8]Five subspecies are recognised:[7]The Eurasian scops owl is 19–21 cm (7.5–8.3 in) in length with a wingspan of 47–54 cm (19–21 in). This is somewhat smaller than the little owl (Athene noctua). It perches upright and shows small ear-tufts. The plumage is predominantly grey-brown in colour, with a paler face, underparts and shoulder line. This species has a strong direct flight on long narrow wings, reflecting its migratory habits.[9]The call is a deep whistle given by both sexes. It is similar to the call of midwife toads in the genus Alytes.[9]This bird breeds in southern Europe eastwards into western and central Asia. It is migratory, wintering in southernmost Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. It was spotted in Newtown area near Kolkata for a brief period during October 2021. It was the first sighting in eastern India.[10] It is rare any distance north of its breeding range, usually occurring as a spring overshoot. It is unlikely that this nocturnal owl would be found outside the breeding season when it is not calling.Eurasian scops owls breed in open woodland, parks and gardens. The nest is usually a hole in a tree or in a wall, but can sometimes be an old nest of another species such as a crow. The clutch is usually 4 or 5 eggs. These are white and measure 31 mm × 27 mm (1.2 in × 1.1 in) and weigh around 13 g (0.46 oz). The eggs are incubated only by the female. They hatch after 24-25 days. The young are cared for and fed by both parents. They fledge when aged 21–29 days and become independent of their parents at 30–40 days of age.[11]It takes small prey such as insects and other invertebrates. It is largely nocturnal."

IBM 7950 Harvest;"The IBM 7950, also known as Harvest, was a one-of-a-kind adjunct to the Stretch computer which was installed at the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Built by IBM, it was delivered in 1962 and operated until 1976, when it was decommissioned. Harvest was designed to be used for cryptanalysis.In April 1958, the final design for the NSA-customized version of IBM's Stretch computer had been approved, and the machine was installed in February 1962.[1] The design engineer was James H. Pomerene,[2] and it was built by IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York. Its electronics (fabricated of the same kind of discrete transistors used for Stretch) were physically about twice as big as the Stretch to which it was attached.  Harvest added a small number of instructions to Stretch, and could not operate independently.An NSA-conducted evaluation found that Harvest was more powerful than the best commercially available machine by a factor of 50 to 200, depending on the task.[3]The equipment added to the Stretch computer consisted of the following special peripherals:With the stream processing unit, Harvest was able to process 3 million characters a second.[3]The TRACTOR tape system, part of the HARVEST system, was unique for its time. It included six tape drives, which handled 1.75-inch-wide (44 mm) tape in cartridges, along with a library mechanism that could fetch a cartridge from a library, mount it on a drive, and return it to the library.  The transfer rates and library mechanism were balanced in performance such that the system could read two streams of data from tape, and write a third, for the entire capacity of the library, without any time wasted for tape handling.Harvest's most important mode of operation was called "setup" mode, in which the processor was configured with several hundred bits of information and the processor then operated by streaming data from memory — possibly taking two streams from memory — and writing a separate stream back to memory.  The two byte streams could be combined, used to find data in tables, or counted to determine the frequency of various values. A value could be anything from 1 to 16 contiguous bits, without regard to alignment, and the streams could be as simple as data laid out in memory, or data read repeatedly, under the control of multiply-nested "do"-loop descriptors, which were interpreted by the hardware.Two programming languages, Alpha and Beta (not be confused with Simula-inspired BETA programming language) were designed for programming it, and IBM provided a compiler for the former around the time the machine was delivered.One purpose of the machine was to search text for key words from a watchlist. From a single foreign cipher system, Harvest was able to scan over seven million decrypts for any occurrences of over 7,000 key words in under four hours.[3]The computer was also used for codebreaking, and this was enhanced by an early distributed networking system codenamed Rye, which allowed remote access to Harvest. According to a 1965 NSA report, "RYE has made it possible for the agency to locate many more potentially exploitable cryptographic systems and 'bust' situations. Many messages that would have taken hours or days to read by hand methods, if indeed the process were feasible at all, can now be 'set' and machine decrypted in a matter of minutes".[4] Harvest was also used for decipherment of solved systems, the report goes on to say that, "Decrypting a large batch of messages in a solved system [is] also being routinely handled by this system".[4]  The Harvest-RYE system became an influential example for computer security, a 1972 review identified NSA’s RYE as one of two “examples of early attempts at achieving ‘multi-level’ security.”[5]Harvest remained in use until 1976, having been in operation at the NSA for fourteen years.[6]  Part of the reason for its retirement was that some of the mechanical components of TRACTOR had worn beyond use, and there was no practical way to replace them.  IBM declined to re-implement the architecture in a more modern technology."

Foca-class submarine;"The Foca class were a group of three minelaying submarines built for the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) during the 1930s. All three sister ships played minor roles during the Second World War. One was lost to unknown causes while trying to lay a minefield off British Palestine in 1940, but the other two survived the war to be discarded in 1947.The Foca-class submarines were improved versions of the preceding Pietro Micca. They displaced 1,326 metric tons (1,305 long tons) surfaced and 1,625 long tons (1,651 t) submerged. The submarines were 82.85 meters (271 ft 10 in) long, had a beam of 7.17 meters (23 ft 6 in) and a draft of 5.2 meters (17 ft 1 in).[1] They had an operational diving depth of 90 meters (300 ft).[2] Their crew numbered 60 officers and men.[1]For surface running, the boats were powered by two 1,440-brake-horsepower (1,074 kW) diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a 625-horsepower (466 kW) electric motor. They could reach 15.2 knots (28.2 km/h, 17.5 mph) on the surface and 7.4 knots (13.7 km/h, 8.5 mph) underwater. On the surface, the Foca class had a range of 7,800 nautical miles (14,400 km, 9,000 mi) at 8 knots (15 km/h, 9.2 mph), submerged, they had a range of 120 nmi (220 km, 140 mi) at 7 knots (13 km/h, 8.1 mph).[2]The boats were armed with six internal 53.3-centimeter (21.0 in) torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern, for which they carried eight torpedoes. They were also armed with one 100-millimeter (4 in) deck gun for combat on the surface. The gun was initially mounted in the rear of the conning tower, but this was re-sited on the forward deck later in the war in the surviving boats and the large conning tower was re-built to a smaller design. Their anti-aircraft armament consisted of two pairs of 13.2-millimeter (0.52 in)  machine guns.[1] The Focas carried a total of 36 mines. Twenty mines were stored in a central chamber, while the remaining 16 mines were kept in two aft chutes through which the mines were ejected.[2]The lead boat, Foca, was lost to unknown causeson 13 October 1940 while laying mines off Haifa.[4] Atropo and Zoea, the second and third vessels of the class, were used after Italy's 1943 surrender by the Allies for anti-submarine training.[5] Both were scrapped in 1947.[1]"

Hawkesbury Valley Buses;"Hawkesbury Valley Buses was an Australian bus company in Western Sydney.Hawkesbury Valley was formed in June 1958 when Bob Kirkpatrick purchased the Maraylya to Windsor and Riverstone services from NK Lakeman-Fidler.[1] In 1977 the depot moved from George Street, South Windsor to Old Stock Route Road, Oakville.[2] In February 1984 the Windsor to Wisemans Ferry service was purchased from R Clarkson.In November 1990, Hawkesbury Valley was sold to Joe and Tony Calabro.[3][4] The Calabro family had sold their 70 vehicle Bonnyrigg operation to Westbus in June 1989[5] and subsequently purchased Surfside Buslines in October 1989.[6][7]The Calabros expanded their Sydney presence purchasing Neville's Bus Service in 1994 and Liverpool Transport Co in 1997. During 1994/95 Hawkesbury Valley operated a service between the international and domestic terminals at Sydney Airport for Qantas.[8]From 2005 Hawkesbury Valley's services formed part of Sydney Bus Region 1, held in partnership with Busways and Westbus. On 6 October 2013, Busways commenced operating Region 1 services in its own right. This resulted in it taking over the services operated by Hawkesbury Valley.[9][10] It continued to trade as a charter operator until closing on 24 April 2017.[11][12] As at December 2021, the Oakville depot was occupied by Telfords Bus & Coach.As at December 2014, the fleet consisted of 11 buses.[13] Until 1990 Hawkesbury Valley operated two Austral Tourmaster coaches. Many of Hawkesbury Valley's buses have come from or gone to other Calabro group companies. The fleet livery was blue and gold."

Panchira;"Panchira (パンチラ) is a Japanese word referring to a brief glimpse of a woman's underwear. The term carries risqué connotations similar to the word 'upskirt' in English.In anime and manga, panchira usually refers to a panty-shot, a visual convention used extensively by Japanese artists and animators since the early 1960s. According to Japanese sources, the convention probably started with Machiko Hasegawa's popular comic strip Sazae-san, whose character designs for Wakame Isono incorporated an improbably brief hemline.[1] The practice was later transferred to animation when Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy was adapted for television in 1963. Confined mainly to harmless children's series throughout the remainder of the decade, panchira took on more overtly fetishistic elements during the early seventies.[2] From that point on, panchira became linked with sexual humor such as the kind found in many comedy-oriented shōnen manga.[3]The word is a portmanteau of "panty" (パンティー, pantī) and chira, the Japanese sound symbolism representing a glance or glimpse.[4][5] It differs from the more general term "upskirt" in that panchira specifies the presence of underpants (the absence of which would more accurately be described as ノーパン, nōpan). The word panchira is similar to panty peek in English.The development of panchira in Japanese popular culture has been analyzed by a number of American and Japanese writers. Many observers link the phenomenon to the Westernization of Japan following World War II.[6] During the occupation, fashions, ideas, and media previously unavailable were accessed by the local population, leading to a slight relaxing of earlier taboos. Western-style clothing (including women's underwear) gained popularity in the post-war period, reinforced through numerous media outlets—magazines, newspapers, films, journals, and comics.Traditionally, Japanese women did not wear underwear. On December 16, 1932, there was a fire in the Tokyo Shirokiya department store. Legend has it that some of the female staff tried to use their kimonos to cover their privates as they climbed down ropes from the higher floors, and accidentally fell to their deaths. Japanese newspapers began agitating for women to start wearing 'drawers' (ズローズ zurōzu), but seemingly had little impact at the time. In a 1934 survey by a Fukuoka newspaper, 90% of the women surveyed were still not wearing 'drawers' a year and a half after the fire.[7]At least one Japanese source traces the beginnings of panchira to the release of The Seven Year Itch in 1955.[8] The media coverage surrounding Marilyn Monroe's iconic scene fueled the emerging Japanese craze. According to architectural historian Shoichi Inoue, the practice of "scoring" a glimpse up young women's skirts became extremely popular around this period, "Magazines of the time have articles telling the best places where panties could be viewed".[9] Inoue also writes that actress Mitsuyo Asaka spurred the popularity of the word 'chirarism' (チラリズム 'the thrill of catching a brief glimpse of a women's nether regions') by parting her kimono to show off her legs in her stage shows in the late 1950s.[10]In 1969, the Japanese oil company Maruzen Sekiyū released a television commercial featuring Rosa Ogawa in a mini-skirt that gets blown up by the wind and her lips forming an 'O' in surprise. This led to children imitating her line "Oh! Mōretsu" (Oh！モーレツ, too much, radical), and a fad for sukāto-mekuri (スカート捲り flipping up of a girl's skirt).[11] Ogawa subsequently appeared in a TV show Oh Sore Miyo (Oh! それ見よ, literally "look at that," but actually a pun on 'O Sole Mio,' a neapolitan song 'my sunshine') that again featured scenes of her mini-skirt blowing up.By the late 1960s, panchira had spread to the mainstream comic industry, as fledgling manga artists such as Go Nagai began exploring sexual imagery in boys' comics (shōnen manga).[12] Adult manga magazines had existed since 1956 (e.g. Weekly Manga Times), but it is significant to note the introduction of sexual imagery into boys manga. Millegan argues that the ecchi genre of the 1970s rose to fill a void left by the decline of Osaka's lending library network:[13]Japanese comics did not seriously begin exploring erotic themes until the sixties, with the collapse of the pay-library system (largely brought about by the unexpected success of cheap comic magazines such as Kodansha Publishing's Shōnen Magazine). Artists working for the pay-library system had already pioneered the depiction of graphic violence, and had proudly declared that they were drawing gekiga ("drama pictures"), not mere comics. In the search for realism (and readers), it was inevitable that sex would soon make an appearance.As the Japanese comics market diversified, sex spread beyond the gekiga to just about every conceivable niche in the marketplace. The gekiga continued their realistic and often violent depictions, but the other major divisions in the manga world developed their own approach. Boys' comics began to explore "cute" sex, mainly consisting of panchira ("panty shots") and girls in showers.A generalized perspective is provided by Mio Bryce's analysis of classroom imagery in Japanese comics. Using Go Nagai's Harenchi Gakuen as a prime example, Bryce notes that Nagai's storylines challenged long-standing social values by ridiculing traditional authority figures. Teachers in Nagai's manga were portrayed as deviants and perverts, engaging in various forms of aggressively voyeuristic behavior towards their female students. In this regard, panchira was employed as a form of social satire, voicing a general mistrust of authoritarian regimes.[14]In much the same vein, Bouissou states that Harenchi Gakuen 'smashed' the Japanese taboo against eroticism in children's comics, indicative of the rapidly changing cultural attitudes endemic to late 60s Japan. Although the eroticism was confined mainly to panchira and soft-core cartoon nudity, the manga's impact was felt all across the country. As Bouissou points out, the publication of Harenchi Gakuen sparked a "nationwide boom of sukāto mekuri (to flip up a girl's skirt)".[15]Jonathan Abel's work on the unmentionables of Japanese film argues that the cultivation of the underwear fetish through roman poruno films after a police seizure may have first been evidence of covering up, but rapidly became a signifier of that which could never be attained. Abel's psychoanalytical approach then calls for the use of "panchira" as a term for eroticization of the invisible.[16]There are few academic studies dealing specifically with panchira, the subject has been touched on by several writers under the broader context of the male gaze. From the Western perspective, panchira is characterized by the sexual stereotyping inherent in patriarchal culture. Anne Allison makes reference to the convention in Permitted and Prohibited Desires, theorizing that the exposure of women's (or girls') underwear in ero-manga is constructed as an "immobilizing glance", in the sense that panchira is usually presented as a tableau in which the (female) object of desire is 'petrified' by the male gaze.[17] She further postulates that this 'glance' is generally depicted as transgressive: the audience is permitted a glimpse of the female body (partially) unclothed, but it is always framed as a forbidden action. This prohibitive tableau permeates the entire genre, as virtually all ero-manga follow the same formula of transgression and immobilization.[18]Similarly, Anne Cooper-Chen states that the endlessly repeated image "of a male gazing at a female's panty-clad crotch" represents an archetypal manga panel.[19] She supports Allison's view that women/girls portrayed in their underwear (or naked) is a common motif in Japanese comics, and is most frequently accompanied by a masculine "viewer" whose voyeuristic presence is indicative of the male gaze. However, in contrast to Allison, Cooper-Chen's observations are not confined only to the ero market. Rather, she argues that the dominant trope of frustrated desire and sexual violence may be extended to the manga mainstream.[20]"

Ethel Barrymore on stage, screen and radio;"Ethel Barrymore (born Ethel Mae Blythe, 1879–1959) was an American actress of stage, screen and radio. She came from a family of actors, she was the middle child of Maurice Barrymore and Georgie Drew Barrymore, and had two brothers, Lionel and John.[1][2] Reluctant to pursue her parents' career, the loss of financial support following the death of Louisa Lane Drew, caused Barrymore to give up her dream of becoming a concert pianist and instead earn a living on the stage.[3][4] Barrymore's first Broadway role, alongside her uncle John Drew, Jr., was in The Imprudent Young Couple (1895).[5] She soon found success, particularly after an invitation from William Gillette to appear on stage in his 1897 London production of Secret Service. Barrymore was soon popular with English society, and she had a number of romantic suitors, including Laurence Irving, the dramatist. His father, Henry Irving, cast her in The Bells (1897) and Peter the Great (1898).[1]On her return to America in 1898, Barrymore was lauded by the press and public and, under Charles Frohman's management, she appeared in Catherine (1898) and Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines (1901) on Broadway. The latter play was a success, and Barrymore received particular praise. She went on to have a series of similarly popular roles in Cousin Kate (1903), Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire (1905), Lady Frederick (1908) and Déclassée (1920), among others.[1][3] After a series of less well-received roles in the early 1920s, she returned to popularity with her role as the sophisticated spouse of a philandering husband in The Constant Wife (1927). In 1928 the Ethel Barrymore Theatre was opened in her honor, and she appeared in its inaugural production, The Kingdom of God.[4]Barrymore began her film career in The Nightingale in 1914, followed by a series of other silent films, but she never dedicated herself to the medium fully.[1] When opportunities for the right stage roles declined in the 1930s and she encountered financial difficulties, she appeared in her first talking film, Rasputin and the Empress (1932)—in which both her brothers also starred[6]—and began radio broadcasts on the Blue Network with The Ethel Barrymore Theater.[7] In the 1940s she had a last stage triumph in the long-running The Corn Is Green (1942), in which she had "perhaps her most acclaimed role", according to her biographer, Benjamin McArthur.[1] Her film work became increasingly prominent in the 1940s and 1950s, and she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for None but the Lonely Heart (1944). She received subsequent Academy Award nominations—again for Best Supporting Actress—for The Spiral Staircase (1946), The Paradine Case (1947) and Pinky (1949). She was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960[8] and is, along with her two brothers, included in the American Theater Hall of Fame.[9]"

.25-20 Winchester;"The .25-20 Winchester, or WCF (Winchester center fire), was developed around 1895 for the Winchester Model 1892 lever action rifle.  It was based on necking down the .32-20 Winchester. In the early 20th century, it was a popular small game and varmint round, developing around 1,460 ft/s with 86-grain bullets.But two years earlier Marlin Firearms Co. had already necked down the .32-20 Winchester, and called it the .25-20 Marlin. It was first chambered in Model 1889 lever action Marlins long before Winchester did the same thing and put their name on the .25-20.[2]While the SAAMI pressure rating is a full 28,000 CUP, modern ammunition is often loaded lighter in deference to the weaker steels used on many of the original guns. The early black powder cartridges were loaded to about 20,000 psi, but the SAAMI rating is close to that of the high velocity smokeless rounds produced later. The high velocity loadings developed 1,732 ft/s.[3]It was easy and economical to reload and was once a favorite with farmers, ranchers, pot hunters, and trappers. Though the .25-20 has been used on deer and even claimed the James Jordan Buck, a whitetail deer of long standing record in 1914,[4] it is now rarely used on large-bodied game due to its sedate ballistics and light bullet construction, which make humane one-shot kills unlikely.  Though the higher velocity loads would be destructive for small game use, the handloader can run heavier  cast lead bullets such as the 85 gr. LRNFP at more sedate velocities around 1,000-1,200 FPS to anchor game with much more authority than the .22 Long Rifle, yet not destroy meat.  The .25-20 is still a very viable small game, fur bearing and trapping cartridge. The .25-20 Winchester is sometimes confused with the similarly named .25-20 Single Shot, the two cartridges are markedly different and do not interchange with one another."

Active redundancy;"Active redundancy is a design concept that increases operational availability and that reduces operating cost by automating most critical maintenance actions.This concept is related to condition-based maintenance and fault reporting.[1]The initial requirement began with military combat systems during World War I. The approach used for survivability was to install thick armor plate to resist gun fire and install multiple guns.This became unaffordable and impractical during the Cold War when aircraft and missile systems became common.The new approach was to build distributed systems that continue to work when components are damaged. This depends upon very crude forms of artificial intelligence that perform reconfiguration by obeying specific rules. An example of this approach is the AN/UYK-43 computer.Formal design philosophies involving active redundancy are required for critical systems where corrective labor is undesirable or impractical to correct failure during normal operation.Commercial aircraft are required to have multiple redundant computing systems, hydraulic systems, and propulsion systems so that a single in-flight equipment failure will not cause loss of life.A more recent outcome of this work is the Internet, which relies on a backbone of routers that provide the ability to automatically re-route communication without human intervention when failures occur.Satellites placed into orbit around the earth must include massive active redundancy to ensure operation will continue for a decade or longer despite failures induced by normal failure, radiation-induced failure, and thermal shock.This strategy now dominates space systems, aircraft, and missile systems.Maintenance requires three actions, which usually involve down time and high priority labor costs:Active redundancy eliminates down time and reduces manpower requirements by automating all three actions. This requires some amount of automated artificial intelligence.N stands for needed equipment. The amount of excess capacity affects overall system reliability by limiting the effects of failure.For example, if it takes two generators to power a city, then "N+1" would be three generators to allow a single failure. Similarly, "N+2" would be four generators, which would allow one generator to fail while a second generator has already failed.Active redundancy improves operational availability as follows.Active redundancy in passive components requires redundant components that share the burden when failure occurs, like in cabling and piping. This allows forces to be redistributed across a bridge to prevent failure if a vehicle ruptures a cable.[2]This allows water flow to be redistributed through pipes when a limited number of valves are shut or pumps shut down.[3]Active redundancy in active components requires reconfiguration when failure occurs. Computer programming must recognize the failure and automatically reconfigure to restore operation. All modern computers provide the following when an existing feature is enabled via fault reporting.Mechanical devices must reconfigure, such as transmission settings on hybrid vehicles that have redundant propulsion systems. The petroleum engine will start up when battery power fails.Electrical power systems must perform two actions to prevent total system failure when smaller failures occur, such as when a tree falls across a power line. Power systems incorporate communication, switching, and automatic scheduling that allows these actions to be automated.This is the only known strategy that can achieve high availability.This maintenance philosophy requires custom development with extra components."
Fernand Charron;"Fernand Charron (30 May 1866, in Angers – 13 August 1928, in Maisons-Laffitte) was a French pioneer of motor racing and automobile manufacturing. He started his sporting career as a successful cyclist.In 1891 he won the French National Stayers Championships riding a bicycle around a track following a tandem.Between 1897 and 1903 he took part in 18 car races, 4 of which he won: Marseille–Nice and Paris–Amsterdam–Paris in 1898, Paris–Bordeaux in 1899, and the inaugural Gordon Bennett Cup (Paris–Lyon) in 1900. He drove mainly Panhard & Levassor cars.On one occasion, he crashed into a St Bernard dog which became wedged between the right wheel and the suspension and jammed the steering, though he still won the race.[1] He retired after an unsuccessful season in 1903 and worked as manager of Adolphe Clément's factory complex at Levallois-Perret.In 1901, Charron was one of the three founders of an automobile manufacturer, Charron, Girardot et Voigt (CGV).[2]  Following resignations, the company was reformed in 1906 at Puteaux as Charron Ltd., the English "Ltd" suffix reflecting a large amount of investment capital that came from England.[2]  Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Charron was trying to sell his auto business, but he nevertheless was also using it at this time to build cars for the Alda company.[2] The arrival of peace in 1918 found Charron still owner of the business. At the  Paris Motor Show in October 1919, it offered two models, the small 6HP "Type TC" (derived from the "Charronette" of 1914) and the 15HP "Type PGM".[2]Charron married in 1907, and later divorced, Jeanne Clément, the second daughter of cycle and motor manufacturer Adolphe Clément.[3]This biographical article related to French auto racing is a stub.

Sebastian Prödl;"Sebastian Prödl (born 21 June 1987) is an Austrian former professional footballer who played as a centre-back. A full international from 2007 to 2018, he represented the Austria national team at UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2016.Having started his career at Sturm Graz in 2006 he moved to Germany two years later where he played for Werder Bremen until 2015, and then Premier League club Watford F.C. for five years, before landing at Udinese in Italy.Aged 19, Prödl began his professional career playing for Sturm Graz in the Austrian Bundesliga making his debut on 9 December 2006 in a 3–0 loss against SV Mattersburg.[4][5] He scored his first Sturm Graz goal against Rheindorf Altach on 9 May 2007 in a 1–0 win.[6] Prödl went on to make sixteen appearances and scoring once in his first season.Prödl soon established himself in the first team at Sturm Graz and despite the international commitment[5] and injury,[7] He went on to score three goals in 27 appearances against SV Mattersburg, Red Bull Salzburg[8] and Austria Kärnten.[9] His performances soon attracted attention from Serie A and Bundesliga clubs.[10] In response to the transfer speculation Sturm Graz placed a price tag of €5 million on him.[11]On 15 July 2008, Prödl moved to Germany to play for Werder Bremen for a transfer fee of €2.5 million, signing a contract until 2012.[12] Upon joining Werder Bremen, he said his aim at the club was to win trophies.[13]Prödl made his Werder Bremen debut in the first round of the DFB-Pokal in a 9–3 win over Eintracht Nordhorn on 9 August 2008. A week later, he made his league debut for the club, in a 2–2 draw against Arminia Bielefeld.[14] He made his Champions League debut, playing as a right-back, in a 1–1 draw against Inter Milan on 1 October 2008.[15] By the first half of the season, he had appeared in 13 of 17 league matches, also playing in the unfamiliar right-back role in absence of Clemens Fritz.[16] In the last match of the first half of the season he injured his ankle which saw him out for two months.[17] On 7 March 2009, after making the bench in three matches, Prödl returned to the first team in a 0–0 draw against Hoffenheim.[18] He scored his first Werder Bremen goal in the second leg of the last 16 of the UEFA Cup in a 2–2 draw against Saint-Étienne, from which the club progressed winning 3–2 on aggregate.[19] Upon his return he reverted to centre-back going on to make a total of 22 appearances in his first season. Prödl formed a partnership with Naldo in central defence when they beat Bayer Leverkusen 1–0 in the DFB-Pokal Final.[20] He also featured in the UEFA Cup final, playing the full 120 minutes in a 3–2 loss against Shakhtar Donetsk.[21]In the opening game of the 2009–10 season, Prödl played as a centre-back in a 3–2 loss against Eintracht Frankfurt and was sent-off in the last minutes after a second bookable offence.[22] Soon after, he suffered a knee injury.[23] After three months on the sidelines, he appeared on the substitution bench and made his return to the first team coming on for Naldo in the 76th minute of a 6–0 win over Freiburg on 21 November 2009.[24] He scored his first Werder Bremen league goal on 27 February 2010, in a 2–1 win over Mainz 05.[25] Prödl spent most of the season on the substitution bench making nine appearances for the club.In the 2010–11 season, Prödl became a regular starter following Naldo's injury at the start of the season and formed a partnership in central defence with Per Mertesacker.[26] He scored his first European goal on matchday 6 of the Champions League group stage in a 3–0 win over Inter Milan on 7 December 2010.[27] He scored his first league goal of the season on 27 February 2011 in a 2–2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen.[28] Having suffered a knee injury and undergone surgery it was announced in March 2011 that Prödl would miss the remainder of the 2010–11 season. He ended season with 25 appearances.[29]At the start of the 2011–12 season, Prödl remained a regular starter. He scored his first goal of the season in a 3–1 win over Mainz on 29 October 2011.[30] On 21 January 2012, during a match against Kaiserslautern, he was substituted off with an injury in the 29th minute.[31] After a successful surgery, it was announced that he would be out for six weeks.[32] Prödl made his return against Hannover 96 on 11 March 2012 scoring in a 3–0 win.[33] However, his return was short-lived as he suffered a hamstring injury which kept him out for two weeks.[34] He made his return to the first team on 28 April 2012, in a 3–1 loss against Wolfsburg.[35] Having made 16 appearances in the 2011–12 season, it was announced that Prödl had signed a new three-year contract with the club, which would keep him at the club until summer 2015.[36]After playing two matches of the 2012–13 season, Prödl suffered injuries first to his thigh[37] and then his head.[38] Upon his return, he scored his first goal of the season in a 4–1 win over Hoffenheim on 2 December 2012.[39] On 23 February 2013, he was sent-off in the 44th minute of a match against Bayern Munich for a foul on Mario Gómez, Werder Bremen went on to lose 6–1.[40] He was given a two-match ban for the red card.[41] In a match against Fortuna Düsseldorf on 13 April 2013 he was appointed captain and played the full 90 minutes of a 2–2 draw.[42] Prödl finished the 2012–13 season with 28 caps.In the 2013–14 season, Prödl scored in the club's first match without Thomas Schaaf, which Werder Bremen lost 3–1 to Saarbrücken in the first round of DFB Pokal.[43] In the opening game of the season against Eintracht Braunschweig, he provided the assist for compatriot Zlatko Junuzović to score the only goal in the game.[44] He then suffered a muscle injury which kept him out for two weeks.[45] By 21 November 2013, his recovery was delayed by three weeks.[46] After making his return, Prödl captained four matches between 1 February 2014 and 1 March 2014. He scored two goals in two matches against Wolfsburg[47] and Hannover 96.[48] In March 2014, he stated he would let his contract run out in 2015 if his contract would not be renewed in the summer.[49] At the end of the season, Prödl had made 27 appearances helping the club avoid relegation and finish in 14th place.[50]After missing two games at the start of the 2014–15 season due to a hamstring injury,[51] Prödl scored his first goal of the season on 12 September 2014, in a 3–3 draw against Bayer Leverkusen.[52] He then missed one match, due to injury, first suffering the flu,[53] then a hip problem.[54] His hip injury came after scoring his second goal of the season, in a 2–0 win over Stuttgart on 8 November 2014.[55] In a 5–2 defeat to Frankfurt, Prödl was substituted off in the first half and it was announced after the match that he would be out for six to eight weeks.[56] He scored on his return on 21 February 2015, in a 1–1 draw against Schalke 04.[57] During the season, he captained his team on five occasions and made 22 league appearances, scoring three goals.On 12 May 2015, it was announced that Prödl would leave Bremen at the end of the 2014–15 season, as his contract had come to an end.[58] The club previously offered him a new contract at the start of the season.[59] During his time at Bremen he scored 10 goals, playing predominately in the central defence role.On 1 June 2015, Prödl signed for Watford on a five-year contract after his contract at Werder Bremen had ended.[60] He became Watford's first signing on their return to the Premier League. Upon joining the club, he was given number five shirt ahead of a new season.[61]Prödl made his Watford debut in the opening game of the season, making his first start in a 2–2 draw against Everton.[62] He remained as a first team regular at the start of the season until he was dropped to the bench in late October ahead of a match against Stoke City,[63] and soon suffered a calf injury during international duty with Austria.[64] As the 2015–16 season progressed towards the end, Prödl would be often be in and out of both in the starting eleven and substitute bench. He scored his first goal for Watford in a 3–1 defeat to West Ham United on 20 April 2016.[65] In the last game of the season, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 2–2 draw against Sunderland.[66]Despite being linked with a move to Serie A side Udinese,[67] Prödl remained at the club and regained his first team place under the management of Walter Mazzarri. In a 3–1 win over Manchester United on 18 September 2016,[68] he was praised for his performance and was named Man of the Match.[69] In May 2017, he was named Watford's player of the season.[70]In the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons he struggled with injuries and was unable to hold down a place in the starting lineup.[71]On 31 January 2020, the last day of the 2019–20 winter transfer period, Prödl agreed the termination of his contract with Watford which was due to end in summer 2021.[71]On 4 February 2020, he signed a 1.5-year contract with Italian Serie A club Udinese.[72] He did not make any appearances in official games for Udinese throughout his contract, appearing only in pre-season friendlies in the summer of 2020.Prödl announced his retirement from playing on 1 June 2022.[73]In 2007, he was called to play for Austria. He served as captain of Austria's U-20 national team at the 2007 U-20 World Cup[74] in Canada where he helped his team to a fourth-place finish. After the tournament was over he was the only Austrian voted into the U-20 World Cup line-up by Italian magazine Gazzetta dello Sport.[75]After being called up to the national team for the first team in May 2007,[76] Prödl made his senior debut for Austria on 30 May 2007 against Scotland.[77] On 26 March 2008, Prödl scored two goals in an international friendly against the Netherlands. On 12 June 2008 during the Euro 2008 Austria vs. Poland game he was fouled in the 92nd minute in the penalty area and the referee, Howard Webb, awarded Austria a penalty kick, resulting in their only goal of the tournament.[78]He represented the national team at Euro 2016.[79]Prödl's cousin Viktoria Schnaderbeck is also a footballer[80] who last played for Arsenal Women and still plays for the Austria women's national football team.[81][82][83]"
Ernesto Bosch;"Ernesto Bosch (January 8, 1863 — August 22, 1951) was a prominent Argentine landowner, lawyer, and diplomat who served as the first President of the Central Bank of Argentina.Ernesto Mauricio Bosch Peña was born to Rosario Peña and Francisco Bosch in Buenos Aires, in 1863.[1] Raised in privileged circumstances, he enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires and earned a juris doctor in 1889, his thesis dealt with life insurance. Bosch married Elisa María de Alvear, with whom he had nine children.He cultivated an interest in international law, and upon graduation, was appointed Secretary of Legation in the Argentine Embassy in Paris. He served in the same capacity in Berlin, and in 1894 was named Chargé d'affaires in the United States,[2] in this capacity Bosch helped secure Argentina's position as an ally to the latter nation. He returned to his country in 1898, and was appointed Federal Interventor (Receiver) of San Luis Province, then in the throes of separatist sentiment. Bosch served as Administrator of the Postal and Telegraph Service in 1904, and in 1905, he was named Ambassador to France.[2]He remained in Paris in that post until, in 1910, newly elected President Roque Sáenz Peña appointed Bosch Minister of Foreign Relations. A colleague of Sáenz Peña, who had served as Ambassador to Italy until his election, Bosch implemented the President's Eurocentric foreign policy, while advancing efforts to coordinate a policy of mutual conflict resolution in Latin America, and he joined the Foreign Ministers of Brazil and Chile in discussions from 1912 onwards for the creation of a tri-national agency to that effect.[3]President Sáenz Peña's failing health, and the unofficial assumption of presidential duties by Vice President Victorino de la Plaza led Bosch to resign on February 16, 1914. The alliance he and Sáenz Peña sought became reality shortly afterwards, however, when the Veracruz Incident in April prompted the first ABC Powers Conference in a bid by the three countries to mediate the United States dispute with Mexico.[3]His return to Argentina, and his years in Paris also inspired the Bosches to have a home built in Buenos Aires to evoke their days in the Franch capital. He commissioned French architect René Sergent in 1910 to design a mansion in the Palermo section of Buenos Aires, and contracted the Parisian interior designer André Carlhian and landscaper Charles Thays. Completed in 1917, the Bosch Palace later became of interest to U.S. Ambassador Robert Woods Bliss during a reception there in his honor, and in 1929, was sold by the Bosches to the U.S. State Department for use as the Ambassador's residence for around US$3 million.[4]The September 1930 coup against President Hipólito Yrigoyen resulted in Bosch's reappointment as Foreign Minister by General José Félix Uriburu. Bosch enjoyed cordial relations with the U.S. government, which supported the influential Standard Oil in its dispute with the deposed Yrigoyen over the latter's oil policy.[5] Bosch resigned on October 9, 1931, to direct the panel that drafted Argentina's proposal at the World Disarmament Conference of 1932.[6]The Roca-Runciman Treaty of 1933 and the resulting abandonment of the Caja de conversión governing monetary policy since 1890 led to the formation of the Central Bank of Argentina on May 28, 1935, upon which Bosch was named its first president, completing a seven-year term, he was reconfirmed in 1942.[7] His upholding treaty obligations to deposit World War II era trade surpluses in the Bank of England ran counter to nationalist policies advanced by the powerful Vice President, Juan Perón,[3] and Bosch was dismissed in 1945, his tenure, marked by a stable peso, would remain the longest in the Central Bank's history to date.[7]Ernesto Bosch died in Buenos Aires on August 22, 1951, he was 88.[8]"
Bromothymol blue;"Bromothymol blue (also known as bromothymol sulfone phthalein and BTB) is a pH indicator. It is mostly used in applications that require measuring substances that would have a relatively neutral pH (near 7). A common use is for measuring the presence of carbonic acid in a liquid. It is typically sold in solid form as the sodium salt of the acid indicator.Bromothymol blue acts as a weak acid in a solution. It can thus be in protonated or deprotonated form, appearing yellow or blue, respectively. It is bright aquamarine by itself, and greenish-blue in a neutral solution. The deprotonation of the neutral form results in a highly conjugated structure, accounting for the difference in color. An intermediate of the deprotonation mechanism is responsible for the greenish color in neutral solution.[2]The protonated form of bromothymol blue has its peak absorption at 427 nm thus transmitting yellow light in acidic solutions, and the deprotonated form has its peak absorption at 602 nm thus transmitting blue light in more basic solutions.[3] Highly acidic Bromothymol blue is magenta in color.The general carbon skeleton of bromothymol blue is common to many indicators including chlorophenol red, thymol blue, and bromocresol green.[2]The presence of one moderate electron-withdrawing group (bromine atom) and two moderate donating groups (alkyl substituents) are responsible for bromothymol blue's active indication range from a pH of 6.0 to 7.6. While the conjugation is responsible for the length and nature of the color change range, these substituent groups are ultimately responsible for the indicator's active range.[2]Bromothymol blue is sparingly soluble in oil, but soluble in water, ether, and aqueous solutions of alkalis. It is less soluble in nonpolar solvents such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, and practically insoluble in petroleum ether.[4]Bromothymol blue is synthesized by addition of elemental bromine to thymol blue in a solution in glacial acetic acid.[5]To prepare a solution for use as pH indicator, dissolve 0.10 g in 8.0 cm3 N/50 (a.k.a. 0.02 Normal) NaOH and dilute with water to 250 cm3. To prepare a solution for use as indicator in volumetric work, dissolve 0.1 g in 100 cm3 of 50% (v/v) ethanol.[4]Bromothymol blue may be used for observing photosynthetic activities, or as a respiratory indicator (turns yellow as CO2 is added).[6][7] A common demonstration of BTB's pH indicator properties involves exhaling through a tube into a neutral solution of BTB.  As CO2 is absorbed from the breath into the solution, forming carbonic acid, the solution changes color from green to yellow. Thus, BTB is commonly used in science classes to demonstrate that the more that muscles are used, the greater the CO2 output.Bromothymol blue has been used in conjunction with phenol red to monitor the fungal asparaginase enzyme activity with phenol red turning pink and bromothymol blue turning blue indicating an increase in pH and therefore enzyme activity.[8] However, a recent study suggests that methyl red is more useful in determining activity due to the bright yellow ring formed in the zone of enzyme activity.[9]It may also be used in the laboratory as a biological slide stain. At this point, the bromothymol is already blue, and a few drops of BTB are used on a water slide. The specimen is mixed with blue BTB solution and fixed to a slide by a cover slip. It is sometimes used to define cell walls or nuclei under the microscope.Bromothymol is used in obstetrics for detecting premature rupture of membranes.[10] Amniotic fluid typically has a pH > 7.2, bromothymol will therefore turn blue when brought in contact with fluid leaking from the amnion. As vaginal pH normally is acidic, the blue color indicates the presence of amniotic fluid. The test may be false-positive in the presence of other alkaline substances such as blood or semen, or in the presence of bacterial vaginosis."
Perpetual usufruct;"Perpetual usufruct (right of perpetual usufruct, RPU) is the English-language term often used by Polish lawyers to describe the Polish version of public ground lease. It is usually granted for 99 years, but never shorter than 40 years, and enables leasehold use of publicly owned land, in most cases located in urban areas. Although it does not give freehold rights, buildings located on such land can be owned directly by private parties. The Act of the transformation of the right of perpetual usufruct into freehold ownership of real estate of 29 July 2005 (Dz.U. 2005 nr 175 poz. 1459) made the transformation possible in specific cases.This law-related article is a stub.

Paris-Plages;"Paris-Plages ("Paris Beaches", until 2006 Paris-Plage in the singular) is a plan run by the office of the mayor of Paris that creates temporary artificial beaches each summer along the river Seine in the centre of Paris, and, since 2007, along the Bassin de la Villette in the northeast of Paris.  Every July and August, roadways on the banks of the Seine are closed off and host various activities, including sandy beaches and palm trees.French city-dwellers traditionally escape to the seaside or the countryside during the summer, especially in August. Paris is avoided, as the weather is unpleasantly hot and humid, and the centre has many tourists. Nevertheless, each summer many residents are obliged to remain in the city, however reluctantly.  The Paris-Plages scheme was instigated in 2002 by Bertrand Delanoë, the newly elected Socialist Party mayor, as a haven for relieving the misery of those cooped up in the sweltering city.Initially there was a single beach on the Rive Droite. In 2006 a second beach was added on the Rive Gauche, and the scheme's name changed from singular to plural.[1] Unlike many beaches in France, topless sunbathing is not permitted. Swimming in the Seine is also not permitted, for safety reasons.[2]The scheme has proven a major success, the number of visitors has grown each year and topped four million in 2007.  Every season, new features are added.[2] These include a shuttle ferry linking the two riverbanks, a floating swimming pool, and another beach area at La Villette, in the northeast corner of the city.The beaches were built free of charge by LafargeHolcim from 2002 to 2017, when the city of Paris discontinued their contract in retaliation for LafargeHolcim's proposal to build the wall  on the Mexico–United States border promised by U.S. President Donald Trump.[3]The name "Paris-Plage" was trademarked in 2002. In August 2006, the mayor's office sued the commune of Le Touquet-Paris-Plage for impinging on the trademark by using the phrase "Paris-Plage" in its tourism marketing.  This was greeted with scepticism, since the commune's name dated from 1912, based on earlier popular usage. The case was dropped in 2008.[4][5] Media related to Paris Plages at Wikimedia Commons"
Akai Ito (song);""Akai Ito" (赤い糸 "Red Thread") is a pop song by Japanese recording artist Yui Aragaki. It was released as her second single on October 15, 2008.[1]"Akai Ito" is a cover of one of Kobukuro's lesser known songs from their independent releases.[2] Kobukuro's team wanted to bring focus to the song once again and suggested to the band they have a female vocalist cover it.[2] Upon hearing Kobukuro perform the song at a Warner Music Japan Convention concert, Aragaki fell in love with the song and agreed to cover it.[2] Aragaki's version was subsequently produced by Tokyo Jihen member Seiji Kameda.[2]The single was released in two formats: a limited edition, which has an illustration cover drawn by Aragaki herself and a standard edition, which comes with a bonus DVD that includes the music video for "Akai Ito" as well as its making of.[3]"Akai Ito" peaked at #1 on the daily Oricon singles chart and #3 on the weekly chart, selling 34,236 copies in its first week.[4][5] The song debuted at #1 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, making it her second consecutive number-one debut on this chart[6] "Akai Ito" was the 15th best selling single for the month of October and ranked #120 on the yearly Oricon singles chart.[7][8]"

Diallo Javonne French;"Diallo Javonne French (born 1971 in Kansas City) is a filmmaker and photographer. His film May This Be Love aired on the BET program Lens on Talent in 2009 and won first place at the Urban Mediamakers Film Festival.French grew up in Kansas City, Kansas.[1] He started out as a musician but switched to filmmaking at 19 years old when he bought an 8mm camera from a pawn shop.  He taught himself production shooting creating 8mm and 16mm short films.[2] From 1994 to 1996, French attended Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia. While in Georgia, he worked as a music video production assistant for “Creep” by TLC, “Call Therapy” by Goodie Mob, “Benz or a Beemer” by Outkast, and “Tonight” by Xscape.[3] In 2001 French returned to Kansas City and began working at the American Jazz Museum in the historic 18th and Vine district which sparked his interest in jazz photography.In 2006 French wrote and directed the short film ‘’May This Be love’’, starring Kevin “Kre8” Browne and Keisha McGautha. The film, shot in black and white 35 mm,[2] follows the story of two lovers set against the backdrop of jazz music and a poem by Kansas City poet Glenn North. May This Be Love won first place at the Urban Mediamakers Film Festival in 2007 and aired on the BET series Lens on Talent in 2009.[3] It was shown at the San Francisco Film Festival and the Spaghetti Junction Urban Film Festival.A selectee of the Kansas City Film Festival in 2016, ‘’Pay Respects’’ is an experimental short film about the history of African American music.Kansas City Dreamin’ is a documentary about French capturing the Kansas City Jazz community through black and white photography over a decade and interviews with musicians especially Bobby Watson.  French also included Kansas City natives Janelle Monae, Marva Whitney and Tech N9ne, to “inspire the next generation, those kids who are in Paseo [High School] now” with their music.[4]A love story about a soul singer and what inspires him to make music. It stars Kansas City native Anthony Saunders who is a singer songwriter. The film includes music from Kansas City jazz, R&B, and hip hop artists, and "a percentage of the film's proceeds will go towards music education in the Kansas City area".[5]French’s photography has been showcased in venues such as the American Jazz Museum, The Box Gallery, Buttonwood Art Space, and on Hallmark cards.[3]  His photographs, shot in black and white without studio lighting, capture the Kansas City Jazz scene. Saxophonist Bobby Watson once told French, “You really captured something. You’re not just taking pictures, you’re documenting,” something that French says he will always remember.[4]French uses black and white film to create a sense of timelessness in his films and photography with a focus around music and romantic love. Being influenced by jazz music, French says "photographing jazz musicians in their element, usually in a dimly lit atmosphere, never using flash, only natural light, allows me to become a part of the music while I'm shooting, attempting to capture a pure moment of musical expression."[2]"

Metamath;"Metamath is a formal language and an associated computer program (a proof checker) for archiving, verifying, and studying mathematical proofs.[2] Several databases of proved theorems have been developed using Metamath covering standard results in logic, set theory, number theory, algebra, topology and analysis, among others.[3]As of February 2022[update], the set of proved theorems using Metamath is one of the largest bodies of formalized mathematics, containing in particular proofs of 74[4] of the 100 theorems of the "Formalizing 100 Theorems" challenge,[5] making it fourth after HOL Light, Isabelle, and Coq, but before Mizar, ProofPower, Lean, Nqthm, ACL2, and Nuprl. There are at least 19 proof verifiers for databases that use the Metamath format.[6]This project is the first one of its kind that allows for interactive browsing of its formalized theorems database in the form of an ordinary website.[7]The Metamath language is a metalanguage, suitable for developing a wide variety of formal systems. The Metamath language has no specific logic embedded in it. Instead, it can simply be regarded as a way to prove that inference rules (asserted as axioms or proven later) can be applied.The largest database of proved theorems follows conventional ZFC set theory and classic logic, but other databases exist and others can be created.The Metamath language design is focused on simplicity, the language, employed to state the definitions, axioms, inference rules and theorems is only composed of a handful of keywords, and all the proofs are checked using one simple algorithm based on the substitution of variables (with optional provisos for what variables must remain distinct after a substitution is made).[8]The set of symbols that can be used for constructing formulas is declared using $c (constant symbols) and $v (variable symbols) statements, for example:The grammar for formulas is specified using a combination of $f (floating (variable-type)hypotheses) and $a (axiomatic assertion) statements, for example:Axioms and rules of inference are specified with $a statements along with ${ and $} for block scoping and optional $e (essential hypotheses) statements, for example:Using one construct, $a statements, to capture syntactic rules, axiom schemas, and rules of inference is intended to provide a level of flexibility similar to higher order logical frameworks without a dependency on a complex type system.Theorems (and derived rules of inference) are written with $p statements, for example:Note the inclusion of the proof in the $p statement. It abbreviates the following detailed proof:The "essential" form of the proof elides syntactic details, leaving a more conventional presentation:All Metamath proof steps use a single substitution rule, which is just the simple replacement of a variable with an expression and not the proper substitution described in works on predicate calculus. Proper substitution, in Metamath databases that support it, is a derived construct instead of one built into the Metamath language itself.The substitution rule makes no assumption about the logic system in use and only requires that the substitutions of variables are correctly done.Here is a detailed example of how this algorithm works. Steps 1 and 2 of the theorem 2p2e4 in the Metamath Proof Explorer (set.mm) are depicted left. Let's explain how Metamath uses its substitution algorithm to check that step 2 is the logical consequence of step 1 when you use the theorem opreq2i. Step 2 states that ( 2 + 2 ) = ( 2 + ( 1 + 1 ) ). It is the conclusion of the theorem opreq2i. The theorem opreq2i states that if A = B, then (C F A) = (C F B). This theorem would never appear under this cryptic form in a textbook but its literate formulation is banal: when two quantities are equal, one can replace one by the other in an operation. To check the proof Metamath attempts to unify (C F A) = (C F B) with ( 2 + 2 ) = ( 2 + ( 1 + 1 ) ). There is only one way to do so: unifying C with 2, F with +, A with 2 and B with ( 1 + 1 ). So now Metamath uses the premise of opreq2i. This premise states that A = B. As a consequence of its previous computation, Metamath knows that A should be substituted by 2 and B by ( 1 + 1 ). The premise A = B becomes 2=( 1 + 1 ) and thus step 1 is therefore generated. In its turn step 1 is unified with df-2. df-2 is the definition of the number 2 and states that 2 = ( 1 + 1 ). Here the unification is simply a matter of constants and is straightforward (no problem of variables to substitute). So the verification is finished and these two steps of the proof of 2p2e4 are correct.When Metamath unifies ( 2 + 2 ) with B it has to check that the syntactical rules are respected. In fact B has the type class thus Metamath has to check that ( 2 + 2 ) is also typed class.The Metamath program is the original program created to manipulate databases written using the Metamath language. It has a text (command line) interface and is written in C. It can read a Metamath database into memory, verify the proofs of a database, modify the database (in particular by adding proofs), and write them back out to storage.It has a prove command that enables users to enter a proof, along with mechanisms to search for existing proofs.The Metamath program can convert statements to HTML or TeX notation,for example, it can output the modus ponens axiom from set.mm as:Many other programs can process Metamath databases, in particular, there are at least 19 proof verifiers for databases that use the Metamath format.[9]The Metamath website hosts several databases that store theorems derived from various axiomatic systems. Most databases (.mm files) have an associated interface, called an "Explorer", which allows one to navigate the statements and proofs interactively on the website, in a user-friendly way. Most databases use a Hilbert system of formal deduction though this is not a requirement.The Metamath Proof Explorer (recorded in set.mm) is the main and by far the largest database, with over 23,000 proofs in its main part as of July 2019. It is based on classical first-order logic and ZFC set theory (with the addition of Tarski-Grothendieck set theory when needed, for example in category theory). The database has been maintained for over twenty years (the first proofs in set.mm are dated August 1993). The database contains developments, among other fields, of set theory (ordinals and cardinals, recursion, equivalents of the axiom of choice, the continuum hypothesis...), the construction of the real and complex number systems, order theory, graph theory, abstract algebra, linear algebra, general topology, real and complex analysis, Hilbert spaces, number theory, and elementary geometry. This database was first created by Norman Megill, but as of 2019-10-04 there have been 48 contributors (including Norman Megill).[10]The Metamath Proof Explorer references many text books that can be used in conjunction with Metamath.[11] Thus, people interested in studying mathematics can use Metamath in connection with these books and verify that the proved assertions match the literature.This database develops mathematics from a constructive point of view, starting with the axioms of intuitionistic logic and continuing with axiom systems of constructive set theory.This database develops mathematics from Quine's New Foundations set theory.This database starts with higher-order logic and derives equivalents to axioms of first-order logic and of ZFC set theory.The Metamath website hosts a few other databases which are not associated with explorers but are nonetheless noteworthy. The database peano.mm written by Robert Solovay formalizes Peano arithmetic. The database nat.mm[12] formalizes natural deduction. The database miu.mm formalizes the MU puzzle based on the formal system MIU presented in Gödel, Escher, Bach.The Metamath website also hosts a few older databases which are not maintained anymore, such as the "Hilbert Space Explorer", which presents theorems pertaining to Hilbert space theory which have now been merged into the Metamath Proof Explorer, and the "Quantum Logic Explorer", which develops quantum logic starting with the theory of orthomodular lattices.Because Metamath has a very generic concept of what a proof is (namely a tree of formulas connected by inference rules) and no specific logic is embedded in the software, Metamath can be used with species of logic as different as Hilbert-style logics or sequents-based logics or even with lambda calculus.However, Metamath provides no direct support for natural deduction systems. As noted earlier, the database nat.mm formalizes natural deduction. The Metamath Proof Explorer (with its database set.mm) instead uses a set of conventions that allow the use of natural deduction approaches within a Hilbert-style logic.Using the design ideas implemented in Metamath, Raph Levien has implemented very small proof checker, mmverify.py, at only 500 lines of Python code.Ghilbert is a similar though more elaborate language based on mmverify.py.[13] Levien would like to implement a system where several people could collaborate and his work is emphasizing modularity and connection between small theories.Using Levien seminal works, many other implementations of the Metamath design principles have been implemented for a broad variety of languages. Juha Arpiainen has implemented his own proof checker in Common Lisp called Bourbaki[14] and Marnix Klooster has coded a proof checker in Haskell called Hmm.[15]Although they all use the overall Metamath approach to formal system checker coding, they also implement new concepts of their own.Mel O'Cat designed a system called Mmj2, which provides a graphic user interface for proof entry.[16] The initial aim of Mel O'Cat was to allow the user to enter the proofs by simply typing the formulas and letting Mmj2 find the appropriate inference rules to connect them. In Metamath on the contrary you may only enter the theorems names. You may not enter the formulas directly. Mmj2 has also the possibility to enter the proof forward or backward (Metamath only allows to enter proof backward). Moreover Mmj2 has a real grammar parser (unlike Metamath). This technical difference brings more comfort to the user. In particular Metamath sometimes hesitates between several formulas it analyzes (most of them being meaningless) and asks the user to choose. In Mmj2 this limitation no longer exists.There is also a project by William Hale to add a graphical user interface to Metamath called Mmide.[17] Paul Chapman in its turn is working on a new proof browser, which has highlighting that allows you to see the referenced theorem before and after the substitution was made.Milpgame is a proof assistant and a checker (it shows a message only something gone wrong) with a graphic user interface for the Metamath language(set.mm),written by Filip Cernatescu, it is an open source(MIT License) Java application (cross-platform application: Window,Linux,Mac OS). User can enter the demonstration(proof) in two modes : forward and backward relative to the statement to prove. Milpgame checks if a statement is well formed (has a syntactic verifier). It can save unfinished proofs without the use of dummylink theorem. The demonstration is shown as tree, the statements are shown using html definitions (defined in typesetting chapter). Milpgame is distributed as Java .jar(JRE version 6 update 24 written in NetBeans IDE)."

1951 Canadian census;"The 1951 Canadian census was a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population. The total population count was 14,009,429, representing a 21.8% increase over the 1941 census population count of 11,506,655.[1] The 1951 census was the ninth comprehensive decennial census since Canadian Confederation on 1 July 1867. The previous census was the Northwest Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba 1946 census and the following census was the 1956 census – the first quinquennial, rather than decennial, nationwide census.This was the first census to include Newfoundland, having joined Confederation only two years prior.Canada's Statistics Act legislation does not permit the release of personal information until 92 years have elapsed. Detailed information from this census is not due for release until 2042.[2]Ontario added the largest number of new residents since the 1941 census, while British Columbia saw the highest growth rate among the provinces, becoming the first western province to reach one million inhabitants. Saskatchewan experienced a second consecutive decade of population decline, falling behind both Alberta and British Columbia in size.This Canadian history article is a stub.

Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture;"The Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture is an annual award for public sculpture in the UK or Ireland.[1][2]The Award is funded by the Marsh Charitable Trust and is made on the recommendation of a panel of judges under the auspices of the Public Statues and Sculpture Association (PSSA), formerly the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association (PMSA).The award is generally made to a work of new sculpture, which has to be erected in a place accessible to the public. However awards have also been made to restorations of historic sculpture and in 2011 an award was made to the town of Harlow in Essex for its work in creating an environment for sculpture in the town and promoting this as Harlow Sculpture Town.The Award Ceremony is held annually at the PMSA headquarters in Cowcross Street, London, every November, although in 2009 it was held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, when it was presented by Boris Johnson.The PMSA also organises a biennial award for public fountains in association with the Marsh Christian Trust. The Trust also organises other awards in arts, heritage, conservation and the environment and social welfare, with other organisations.Winners of the Marsh Award for Public Sculpture include:[3]"
Penrith A.F.C.;"Penrith Association Football Club is a football club based in Penrith, Cumbria, England. They play in the Northern Football League Division One.Founded in 1894.[1] They originally joined the North Eastern League in 1907–08, and are currently members of the Northern League Division One.The club joined the Northern League in 1947, spending 35 years in that competition until moving to the North West Counties League in 1982. A five-season spell in that league (including finishing as league runners-up in their first season) saw them in a position to join the Northern Premier League when they expanded to form a second division in 1987.The move to the NPL did not prove successful, and by 1990 they were relegated back to the North West Counties League, where they stayed for seven seasons before returning once more to the Northern League, fifteen years after originally leaving that league.In 1981–82, they had their best ever FA Cup run, reaching the second round, beating Football League club Chester City in the first round.In 2007, they changed their name to Penrith Town, but a merger a year later with Northern Football Alliance club Penrith United saw the old name resurrected for the merged club.Since then they have continued to play in The Northern League.In 2008 the club saw its ground at Southend Rd earmarked for development and a new stadium was built at Frenchfield Park with the first home game played on August 4, 2009.Since moving there the club has carried out significant improvements to the facilities and now has a very modern and picturesque stadium.Coordinates: 54°39′28.3″N 2°42′53.5″W﻿ / ﻿54.657861°N 2.714861°W﻿ / 54.657861, -2.714861"

The One with the Lesbian Wedding;""The One with the Lesbian Wedding" is the eleventh episode of the second season of the television situation comedy Friends. It attracted mild controversy and censorship as a result of its portrayal of same-sex marriage. The episode first aired on January 18, 1996.Ross' ex-wife Carol (Jane Sibbett) and her lesbian life partner Susan (Jessica Hecht) are getting married, Ross' sister Monica caters the wedding. Carol's parents refuse to attend the wedding, leading Carol to doubt her decision, but Ross – initially hesitant to see his ex-wife remarry – finds himself in the position of being the one to encourage her to go ahead with the ceremony despite her parents' opposition. At the reception, Susan thanks Ross for his part in saving the wedding, and offers to dance with him, he agrees, apparently resolving their strained relationship.One of Phoebe's massage clients, Rose Adelman, dies on the massage table and her spirit apparently gets stuck inside Phoebe for a while. Rose, via Phoebe, corrects people's behavior and makes weird jokes using references to obscure people or events. Upon talking to Rose's husband, who states that Rose wanted to see everything, Phoebe takes Rose sightseeing around New York, but is not able to rid herself of Rose. However, during Carol and Susan's wedding, Rose blurts out that she has now seen everything and promptly bolts out of Phoebe's body. During the reception, Phoebe muses to Chandler about how she misses Rose, one of the wedding guests (Lea DeLaria), comically assuming that Phoebe and Rose were a lesbian couple, suggests that Phoebe find a way to forget about Rose and move on with her life, and offers to buy her a drink, which Phoebe accepts.Meanwhile, Rachel's mother, Sandra (Marlo Thomas), makes a major life decision after seeing how Rachel has learned to fend for herself: she is considering leaving Rachel's father. Rachel is horrified at the thought of her parents splitting up and angry at her mother, but Sandra admits she wants to do this because Rachel did not marry her Barry, the man she never loved, but she did hers. Rachel, stunned at this revelation, gives her mother her blessing to move on.Early on in the episode, Joey makes his first appearance on the long-running soap opera Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray. He shares with the group a "smell-the-fart" acting tip he had learned from the actress he did his first scene with.As a result of its portrayal of a lesbian couple marrying, the episode attracted some controversy across the United States. Two network affiliates refused to air the episode⁠—KJAC-TV in Port Arthur, Texas and WLIO in Lima, Ohio⁠⁠—citing objectionable content, although the decision drew little press attention, partly due to the small size of the markets in question.[1] Gay and lesbian groups⁠—notably GLAAD—decried the censorship of the episode.[2]While this episode of Friends was one of the first mainstream portrayals of gay marriage on U.S. television, it was actually the second gay marriage on a sitcom.  Roseanne had aired an episode just five weeks before called "December Bride" in which the title character coordinated and attended a wedding for her co-worker Leon and his partner Scott. The New York Times claimed, "The biggest news about the wedding on Friends was that it was almost no news at all." However, the fact that Carol and Susan's ceremony was officiated by Candace Gingrich, a gay-rights activist and sibling to conservative Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich did draw some media attention, as the casting was perceived as a comment on the Republican Party's anti-gay rights stance and the "Contract with America" platform.[1] A writer with the Associated Press noted in an article that week that the ceremony would not include a kiss by the newlyweds, including the episode as part of an observed trend of portrayals of gay characters while skirting controversy by avoiding or minimizing physical contact.[3]The episode was the highest-rated television program for the week, with 31.6 million viewers.[4] According to Marta Kauffman, 'NBC expected thousands and thousands of phone calls and hate mail' but actually received only four complaints by telephone.[5]"

Sangak Safarov;"Sangak Murodovich Safarov (Tajik: Сангак Муродович Сафаров, 1 January 1928 — 29 March 1993) was a Tajik paramilitary leader and warlord who was one of the leaders of the Popular Front of Tajikistan during the Tajikistani Civil War. Also known as Bobo Sangak, although he did not hold high positions in the government, for some time he was considered by many to be almost the de facto leader of Tajikistan because of his position in the Popular Front.He was born on 1 January 1928 in the village of Dangara. Safarov was a Kulabi Tajik.[1] His father was purged in 1935, his older brother was convicted and shot in 1939, and his two younger brothers died of hunger. In 1951, Safarov was sentenced to 1 year in prison for stealing a car, then in 1957 he was convicted of hitting a pedestrian, which led to death. After serving another term of imprisonment, Safarov worked as a barman in the central park of Dushanbe, but in 1964, he killed a Chechen racketeer, after which he was convicted and spent 23 years in prison.In June 1992, during the Civil War in Tajikistan, his supporters staged an armed uprising in Kulob. On July 28, 1992, a ceasefire was declared, but Safarov stated that his people would not lay down their arms until the opposition government resigns. In September, Safarov, with the active support of Russian Spetsnaz colonel and military intelligence officer Vladimir Kvachkov launched an offensive in Dushanbe. In Kulob, Safarov's units put the biggest pressure on the United Tajik Opposition, and in early October, his forces seized the capital.[2]He is also credited with organizing the killing former Tajik President Qadriddin Aslonov in November 1992.[3] After the 16th session of the Supreme Soviet, Safarov did not receive any official position, remaining the leader of the Popular Front. At the same time he had unlimited power, as many members of the government feared the Popular Front and its influence.He was assassinated on 29 March 1993 alongside Faizali Saidov after an armed clash at the latter's house.[4][5][6] The clash reportedly occurred during an argument over the fate of Tajik refugees in Afghanistan,[7] and it is often believed that they killed each other.[8] Despite this, there are also theories that they were both killed by government forces.[9] The national government declared a state of emergency after their deaths.[10]31 March was declared a day of mourning. Safarov was buried in the city of Kulob in the Khatlon Region. The funeral was attended by Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Emomali Rakhmonov and Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov.Safarov's first marriage was with an Ossetian woman, Tonya, with whom he had a son, Igor. In 1978, after his release from prison, he entered into a second marriage with a 17-year-old Tajik woman, who bore him 4 daughters and 4 sons. His third marriage with a nurse named Mehri in 1992.His followers referred to Safarov, as vozhd, a Russian language word used for Joseph Stalin to denote the leader. Safarov has been described as a “butcher”, with opposition journalist Timur Klychev claiming Safarov entered a village recently and sworn “to destroy all the men from Garm and make the women into slaves.”[11]The Tajik Higher Military College was named after Sangak Safarov (in 2002 it was renamed the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense).[12]"
2019–20 Regionalliga;"The 2019–20 Regionalliga was the twelfth season of the Regionalliga, the eighth under the new format, as the fourth tier of the German football league system.The same promotion format as in the previous season was used.[1] According to the draw that took place on 27 April 2018, the Regionalliga Nord, Südwest, and Bayern champions were directly promoted to the 2020–21 3. Liga, while the champions of the Regionalliga Nordost and West played promotion play-offs to determine the fourth team to be promoted.[2]Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, all scheduled match days in the five Regionalligas were initially suspended in March 2020. The Bavarian Football Association (BVF) announced its decision to suspend all scheduled match days indefinitely on 4 March 2020.[3]The Regionalliga Südwest was cancelled on 26 May 2020. 1. FC Saarbrücken were declared champions and were promoted to the 3. Liga, while no teams were relegated and four teams were promoted from the Oberliga, leading to an expansion of the league for the upcoming season.[4]The Regionalliga Nordost was also cancelled on 5 June 2020. Lokomotive Leipzig were declared champions and qualified for the promotion play-offs, while no teams were relegated based on sporting criteria and two teams were promoted from the NOFV-Oberliga, leading to an expansion of the league for the upcoming season. Rot-Weiß Erfurt had been placed into administration on 29 January 2020 and was therefore relegated to the NOFV-Oberliga.[5] On 25 June 2020, Wacker Nordhausen was voluntarily relegated to the Oberliga after filing for insolvency in December.[6]The Regionalliga Bayern clubs voted on 4 June 2020 to extend their league season beyond September, which meant the Bavarian Football Association had to cancel the 2020–21 season and continue without Türkgücü München,[7] which the BFA registered for promotion to the 3. Liga. Thus, Bavaria is to be represented by a team that wins a play-off series, to be held in the spring of 2021, among the top four teams at the end of the resumed Regionalliga Bayern season. They would have already submitted applications for 3. Liga licences. The Bavarian play-off winners are to face the Regionalliga Nord champions for a place in the 2021–22 3.

Soyuz 2A;"Soyuz 2A is the unofficial designation for a cancelled space flight of a Soyuz spacecraft, planned to rendezvous with the Soyuz 1 mission. The launch of the craft in April 1967 was cancelled due to thunderstorms, likely saving the three-person crew from the same design problems that also killed the one-person crew of Soyuz 1.In the Soviet space program it was usual only for successful launches to gain official designations, so this mission did not receive an official designation and is informally named Soyuz 2A to distinguish it from the later official Soyuz 2 mission, which was launched in October 1968 as an unmanned docking target for Soyuz 3.Over two years had passed since the previous manned Soviet space flight. To introduce the new Soyuz spacecraft, the Soviets planned an ambitious double mission, which would see the two spacecraft dock and exchange passengers. This was despite the failure of unmanned tests of the Soyuz spacecraft, which still contained flaws. Political pressure from the Soviet leadership meant the launch of Soyuz 1 went ahead in spite of these problems.As with the Voshkod flights, the crew came from different departments, commanded by director of cosmonaut training Nikolai Kamanin, and Vasily Mishin, director of the design engineering department OKB-1.Since 1965, Kamanin had eight cosmonauts in training for Soyuz missions. Four had already been in space: Yuri Gagarin, Andriyan Nikolayev, Valery Bykovsky, and Vladimir Komarov. Viktor Gorbatko and Yevgeny Khrunov had been with the program since 1960, and Anatoli Voronov and Pyotr Kolodin had been with the program since 1963, but none had flown into space.Mishin decided to train suitable engineers in his own department as cosmonauts and then nominate them for Soyuz crews. In May 1966 Sergei Anokhin, Aleksei Yeliseyev, and Valeri Kubasov, along with five additional engineers, where added to the group of cosmonauts. A further candidate for mission commander was Georgi Beregovoi, who became a cosmonaut in 1964 due to the promotion of Marshal Rudenko into the group of cosmonauts. Furthermore, Beregovoi was an excellent test pilot, however, he was larger and heavier than the other cosmonauts and he also exceeded the maximum age. The crew assignments were frequently changed. Poor organization also played a role, for in the case of Anokhin there was no spacesuit available for him.In August 1966 it was decided that Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 2 would be commanded by Komarov and Bykovsky respectively, with Gagarin and Nikolayev as their backups. Two additional crew members would be selected from Anokhin, Yeliseyev, Khrunov, and Gorbatko. This decision was not final, however. The decision regarding the crew escalated to the Central Committee, and in November they issued a dispatch stating that Soyuz 1 should be flown by Komorov, with Gagarin as backup. Soyuz 2 should be commanded by Bykovsky with Nikolayev as backup. Therefore, Beregovoi would not have a space flight until Soyuz 3. As for the two cosmonauts who would transfer after docking from Soyuz 2 to Soyuz 1, Khrunov and Yeliseyev where selected, with Gorbatko and Kubasov as their backups. That meant three of the four spots were taken by experienced cosmonauts, while the fourth was taken by an engineer, and Khrunov had already served as a backup for Alexei Leonov during the Voskhod 2 mission.Soyuz 1, with Komarov on board, was launched on 23 April 1967. Soyuz 2 was to be launched the following day, with both spacecraft spending four days in orbit.Serious problems soon arose with Soyuz 1, however, particularly the failure of a solar panel to deploy, which caused the spacecraft's systems to become unstable. It was believed that the cosmonauts from Soyuz 2 could solve the Soyuz 1 solar panel problem via an EVA. However, the Soyuz 2 launch could not proceed due to thunderstorms at the launchpad which affected the booster's electrical system. The Soyuz 1 mission was then aborted and Komarov was able to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. However both parachutes and the retro-rockets failed, and Komarov was killed on impact.During the course of investigations afterward, it was determined that Soyuz 2 had the same parachute issues as Soyuz 1, and if it had been launched, Bykovsky, Khrunov, and Yeliseyev presumably would have been killed as well.The Soyuz 1 disaster set the Soviet space program back 18 months. It was not until October 1968 that the next manned Soyuz mission was launched, flown by Beregovoi.Khrunov and Yeliseyev eventually flew on Soyuz 5, which along with Soyuz 4 achieved the objectives of their Soyuz 2 flight in January 1969. Meanwhile, Bykovsky prepared for a planned manned moon flight, which was never launched."
Kojo Nnamdi;"Rex Orville Montague Paul (born January 8, 1945), better known as Kojo Nnamdi (/ˈkoʊdʒoʊ ˈnɑːmdi/ KOH-joh NAHM-dee), is a Guyanese-born American radio journalist based in Washington, D. C. He is the host of The Kojo Nnamdi Show and The Politics Hour on WAMU, and hosted the Evening Exchange[1] broadcast on WHUT-TV from 1985 to 2011.Nnamdi was born Rex Orville Montague Paul in British Guiana on January 8, 1945.[2] As a high school student, Nnamdi and his friends opposed British colonialism, at odds with their parents.[3]In 1967, a year after Guyana became independent from British rule, Nnamdi moved to Montreal, Canada to attend McGill University after his mother secretly saved her earnings from selling insurance and filled out an application on his behalf.[3] While attending McGill, Nnamdi became interested in the Black Power movement.[4] After a year at McGill, Nnamdi moved to the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the U.S., where he worked on Wall Street and joined the Black Panther Party.[2] However, not long after joining the Panthers, Nnamdi drifted out of the Party. Nnamdi had been seeking a Black Nationalist and Pan-Africanism supporting organisation, whereas by this time the Black Panthers had embraced internationalism and were committed to working with people of all races towards a socialist America. It would not be until later in life that Nnamdi would embrace Marxist theory as the Panthers had.[3]Nnamdi moved to Washington, D.C. in 1969 and enrolled in Federal City College, now the University of the District of Columbia.[5] While attending the college, Nnamdi joined former members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to form the Center for Black Education.[2]Nnamdi began his radio career in 1969 as an actor and director for children's plays that aired Sundays on Washington rhythm and blues radio station WOL.[6] With the on-air name "Brother Uwezo", Nnamdi became editor for Sauti, a news magazine program on WOL, in 1970.[4] After marrying in 1971, he adopted the on-air name that he would use for the rest of his career, Kojo Nnamdi. He described it as an "African Christian name and surname that made more sense", first name "Kojo" being an Akan name for "Monday" and surname "Nnamdi" after the first President of Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe.[4]In 1973, Nnamdi became news editor at WHUR, the radio station of Howard University, a historically black university in Washington.[5] Later becoming news director, Nnamdi helped produce The Daily Drum, a local news program.[5]Nnamdi left WHUR in 1985 to join Howard television station WHMM (later WHUT) as host of Evening Exchange, a public affairs show. Nnamdi hosted Evening Exchange until 2011.[2]On June 13, 1990, Evening Exchange received its highest viewership numbers when Washington mayor Marion Barry announced on the show that he would not seek a fourth term.[6]On August 31, 1998, Nnamdi became host of Public Interest on Washington public radio station WAMU, a show renamed from The Derek McGinty Show. In January of that year, previous host Derek McGinty left WAMU for CBS News.[7] A two-hour program, one hour focused on local issues and was broadcast exclusively on WAMU, and the other discussed national topics and was distributed by National Public Radio (NPR) to around 40 stations.[7] On September 30, 2002, Public Interest was renamed The Kojo Nnamdi Show and dropped national distribution.[8]On Fridays, Nnamdi hosts The Politics Hour, which covers topics related to political issues and events in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including surrounding Maryland and Virginia regions. Before May 2008, the show was titled The D.C. Politics Hour and focused solely on the D.C.-area political scene.[9] The show was renamed The Politics Hour in May 2008, after WAMU fired resident political analyst and Washington Examiner columnist Jonetta Rose Barras over a salary dispute.[10] The show then featured guest analysts until the long-term hiring of WRC-TV political reporter Tom Sherwood in February 2009.[9][11]Barras joined the program after the late Mark Plotkin left in April 2002 to set up shop at all-news station WTOP, where he hosted The Politics Program. Originally called The Politics Hour, the name of Plotkin's show was changed after WAMU threatened a lawsuit. Nonetheless, Plotkin said in a 2006 online chat that he and Nnamdi remain friendly and regularly have dinner together.Every Tuesday the first half of the show consists of a segment called Tech Tuesday that attempts to keep listeners current on various computer/computing and technology issues. For a number of years, the first Tuesday of the month featured "The Computer Guys," John Gilroy and Tom Pivovar. Pivovar left the program in early 2006 in a contract dispute and has been since replaced with a rotation of recurring expert guests, most of whom are employed at either Mid-Atlantic Consulting or the University of Maryland, College Park.On April 1, 2021, Kojo ended his daily program, but the Politics Hour continues on Fridays."

George Sutherland Fraser;"George Sutherland Fraser (8 November 1915 – 3 January 1980) was a Scottish poet, literary critic and academic.Fraser was born in Glasgow, Scotland, later moving with his family to Aberdeen. He attended the University of St. Andrews.During World War II he served in the British Army in Cairo and Eritrea. He was published as a poet in Salamander, a Cairo literary magazine. At the same time he was involved with the New Apocalyptics group, writing an introductory essay for the anthology The White Horseman, and formulating as well as anyone did the idea that they were successors to surrealism.After the war he became a prominent figure in London's literary circles, working as a journalist and critic. Together with his wife Paddy he made friends with a gamut of literary figures, from the intellectual leader William Empson to the eccentric John Gawsworth. He worked with Ian Fletcher to have Gawsworth's Collected Poems (1949) published. His direction was that of the traditional man of letters (soon to become extinct).In 1948, Fraser contributed an essay entitled "A Language by Itself" to a biblio-symposium honouring the sixtieth birthday of T. S. Eliot. Drawing comparisons with John Donne, he praised the poet's profound refreshment (particularly in The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock) of the English poetic tongue, together with his subtle facility for transitional verse and his potent effect on the poetic youth, but, more importantly for present purposes, he also confessed, "I am not a very original writer myself, I am lost, on the whole, without a convention of some sort [...]."[1]In 1949 he accepted the job of replacing Edmund Blunden as Cultural Adviser to the UK Liaison Mission in Tokyo. This ended badly when he suffered a breakdown in 1951 while in Japan. Subsequently he was much less the poet than the all-purpose writer.He became a lecturer at the University of Leicester in 1959, where he was an inspiring teacher, remaining there until retirement in 1979.He married Eileen Lucy Andrew (who was known as Paddy from birth) in 1946. She wrote a brief memoir of her life with Fraser: G. S. Fraser: A Memoir. Together they had two daughters, including Helen Fraser, and a son.[2][3] Paddy died in 2013.[2]A.

Misogamy;"Misogamy is an aversion to or hatred of marriage. The word dates from the mid-17th century and combines the Greek misos (hatred) with gamos (marriage).[1] Merriam-Webster date the first use of the word to around 1656.[2]The idea of misogamy was important in the Christian church during the medieval period as a prerequisite for the celibacy required to occupy the highest positions in the church.[3] It was developed in the philosophy of Theophrastus who became the "canonical authority on philosophic misogamy throughout the Middle Ages".[4] Sara E. Diaz writes that two types of misogamy existed during the period, one advising all men against marriage, and another more limited form advising wise men against marriage.[5]The literature of misogamy has been surveyed by Katharina Wilson and Elizabeth Makowski in their book Wykked Wyves and the Woes of Marriage: Misogamous Literature from Juvenal to Chaucer, published by the State University of New York in 1990.[3]This society-related article is a stub.

Nora Nadjarian;"Nora Nadjarian (born 1966) is an Armenian–Cypriot poet and short story writer. Writing in English, Armenian, and Greek, Nadjarian's writing has focused on the continued fallout of the 1974 partition of Cyprus. A frequent participant in international competitions, poetry festivals, literary conferences and other projects, her poems and short stories have also appeared in numerous anthologies around the world.[1]The writer has said that her work is inspired by Sylvia Plath and Yehuda Amichai.[2] Paul Celan, Pablo Neruda and Sharon Olds are a few other idols that she has mentioned.[3]Nora Nadjarian was born in 1966 in Limassol, a city on the southern coast of Cyprus. Born to parents who worked in the production of fabrics, Nadjarian is the second generation to be born in Cyprus after her Armenian refugee grandparents moved to Cyprus at the beginning of the 20th century.[4] She first attended an Armenian elementary school, then moved to Foley's Grammar School, a private British school, where she earned her high school degree. Following her graduation from Foley's, Nadjarian attended Manchester University and earned a degree from the department of modern languages and linguistics. Upon graduating from Manchester, Nadjarian returned to Cyprus and began teaching in Limassol and then in Nicosia, where she is currently residing.[5]She visited her ancestral homeland of Armenia in 1983 which inspired her to write poems based on ethnic identity, cultural self-discovery, her Armenian roots and the tragic fate of the nation. She first decided to participate in a competition because of the encouragements of a friend, and after being acknowledged for her poem "Vinegar" (1999–2000) she continued to take part in numerous international competitions.Nora Nadjarian has received international praise for her work, particularly her work focused on the Cyprus partition of 1974, identity and loss. She has described her work as "political without being polemical" and has written of an ongoing battle in both the physical sense and mind inside the Cypriot heart that is defined by the division in Nicosia between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides of the island without taking on a side. She condemns the conflict itself, not the people. Her work is read beyond the Mediterranean borders and can very much be identified with in its search to find what defines one's nationality.[6]Other reviews can be found at:https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/01/featuresreviews.guardianreview34William Macfarlane, review of Nora Nadjarian, Girl, Wolf, Bones (2011), in Cadences 8 (2012), 110–111.Many of her poems can be read online through her blog, and some can even be listened to on Lyrikline.Nora Nadjarian was among the winners in the Scottish International Open Poetry Competition in 2000 with her poem "Vinegar", and in 2003 with "Conception".

"And the Seven Dwarves" has been honoured in the Sixth Annual International Ultra-Short Competition (2008–2009), while "Tell Me Words" has been commended in the Ninth Annual International Ultra-Short Competition (2011–2012), events that are sponsored by The Binnacle at the University of Maine at Machias.[11][22][23] Finally, “The Name” won in the unFold 2012 Poetry Garden Show competition.[24]Author Talk"
Synagogue Church building collapse;"Coordinates: 6°32′48″N 3°16′22″E﻿ / ﻿6.5467°N 3.2728°E﻿ / 6.5467, 3.2728On 12 September 2014, a guesthouse located within the Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) premises around the Ikotun-Egbe area of Lagos State collapsed completely to the ground.[2] The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and other emergency services were criticized for withholding information about the accident, and much remained unclear about the number of deaths and their nationalities.[citation needed]On 12 September 2014, a guesthouse collapsed in the SCOAN's premises in Lagos killing at least 115 people, 84 of them were South Africans.[3]Nigerian emergency services refused to release the nationalities of the victims, but other countries have provided some details about those who died. The vast majority of casualties were from South Africa, but the nationalities of dozens of people remained unclear.[1]The then governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, ordered all church workers away from the scene in order to properly rescue trapped bodies.[4] The government also claimed the church did not get government approval before construction.[5] Journalist Nicholas Ibekwe released an audio recording that allegedly captures T.B. Joshua offering bribes to journalists in return for reporting the incident in a way that favorably portrayed the church.[6]The senior pastor of the church, T. B. Joshua has linked the tragedy to a strange aircraft "hovering" above the building shortly before it fell.[7] A video was released on YouTube that allegedly showed the plane hovering around the building before its collapse.[8] However, the coroner's report unequivocally found the cause to be due to structural failure.[9] Three government agencies, (the Nigeria Building And Road Research Institute (NBBRI),  the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) and the Building Collapse Prevention Guild (BCPG)) examined the site and found the following inadequacies:Joshua failed to appear at a November 2015 hearing[11] and SCOAN's lawyers have filed multiple applications to stay the proceedings.[12][13][14] The Lagos state government has repeatedly insisted that this case receive trial.[15]Local radio host Freeze made unfavorable comparisons to a similar incident in Lekki, in which Lekki Gardens managing director Richard Nyong was jailed for illegally unsealing a building that he was having constructed and that which later collapsed.[16][17] Freeze was upset because Nyong had been arrested quickly, Joshua had not.[18]"
A. R. Gurney;"Albert Ramsdell Gurney Jr. (November 1, 1930 – June 13, 2017) (sometimes credited as Pete Gurney) was an American playwright,  novelist and academic.[1][2][3] He is known for works including The Dining Room (1982), Sweet Sue (1986/7), and The Cocktail Hour (1988), and for his Pulitzer Prize nominated play Love Letters. His series of plays about upper-class WASP life in contemporary America have been called "penetratingly witty studies of the WASP ascendancy in retreat."[4]Gurney was born on November 1, 1930 in Buffalo, New York to Albert Ramsdell Gurney Sr. (1896–1977), who was president of Gurney, Becker and Bourne, an insurance and real estate company in Buffalo,[5] and Marion Spaulding (1908-2001).[6][7] His parents had three children, of which Gurney was the middle: (1) Evelyn Gurney Miller (b. 1929),[7][8] (2) Albert Ramsdell Gurney Jr. (b. 1930), and (3) Stephen S. Gurney (b. 1933).[9]His maternal grandparents were Elbridge G. Spaulding (1881–1974) and Marion Caryl Ely (1887–1971). Ely was the daughter of William Caryl Ely (1856–1921), politician and lawyer, Member of the New York State Assembly in 1883.[10] Gurney's 2x great-grandfather was Elbridge G. Spaulding (1809–1897), a former Mayor of Buffalo, NY State Treasurer, and member of the U.S. House of Representatives who supported the idea for the first U.S. currency not backed by gold or silver, thus credited with helping to keep the Union economy afloat during the Civil War.[11]Gurney attended the private school Nichols School in Buffalo and graduating from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire.  He attended Williams College, graduating in 1952, and the Yale School of Drama, graduating in 1958,[6] after which he began teaching Humanities at MIT.[1][12]In 1959, following graduation from Yale, Gurney taught English and Latin at a day school, Belmont Hill School, in Belmont, Massachusetts for one year. He then joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of humanities (1960–96) and professor of literature (1970–96).[6]He began writing plays such as Children and The Middle Ages while at MIT, but it was his great success with The Dining Room that allowed him to write full-time. After The Dining Room, Gurney wrote a number of plays, most of them concerning WASPs of the American northeast. While at Yale, Gurney also wrote Love in Buffalo, the first musical ever produced at the Yale School of Drama.[13] Since then, he is known to be a prolific writer, always writing something.[14]His first play in New York, which ran for just one performance in October 1968, The David Show, premiered at the Players' Theater on MacDougal Street. The play was cut after its first show by sneers from the entire press except for two enthusiasts, Edith Oliver in The New Yorker and another from the Village Voice.[15]His 2015 play, Love and Money, is about a mature woman making plans to dispose of her fortune, and the twists that ensue. The world premiere was at New York's Signature Theatre in August 2015.[16] Before that, The Grand Manner, a play about his real life encounter with famed actress Katharine Cornell in her production of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, was produced and performed by Lincoln Center for the summer of 2010. It was also produced in Buffalo by the Kavinoky Theatre.[17] He appeared in several of his plays including The Dining Room and most notably Love Letters.[citation needed]In June, 1957, Gurney married Molly Goodyear They lived in Boston until 1983, when they moved their family to New York to be near the theater, television, and publishers while he was on sabbatical from MIT.[18]  Together, they had four children:[19]Gurney's father, Albert Ramsdell Gurney Sr., died in 1977 and Molly's mother, Sarah Norton, died in 1978. After their deaths, his mother, Marion, married Molly's father, George, and remained married until Marion's death in 2001,[7] followed by George's death in 2002.[15][18]Gurney died at his home in Manhattan, on June 13, 2017, at the age of 86.[25]In 2006, Gurney was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[26]In 2007, Gurney received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award as a master American dramatist.Gurney was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 Obie Awards presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Village Voice.[27]Gurney's plays often explore the theme of declining upper-class "WASP" (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) life in contemporary America. The Wall Street Journal has called his works "penetratingly witty studies of the WASP ascendancy in retreat."[4] Several of his works are loosely based on his patrician upbringing, including The Cocktail Hour and Indian Blood.[15] The New York Times  drama critic Frank Rich, in his review of The Dining Room, wrote, "As a chronicler of contemporary America's most unfashionable social stratum — upper-middle-class WASPs, this playwright has no current theatrical peer."[28]In his 1988 play, "The Cocktail Hour", the lead character tells her playwright son that theater critics "don't like us.... They resent us. They think we're all Republicans, all superficial and all alcoholics. Only the latter is true."[4] The New York Times described the play as witty observations about a nearly extinct patrician class that regards psychiatry as an affront to good manners, underpaid hired help as a birthright.[29]In a 1989 interview with The New York Times, Gurney said, "Just as it's mentioned in The Cocktail Hour,' my great-grandfather hung up his clothes one day and walked into the Niagara River and no one understood why." Gurney added that "he was a distinguished man in Buffalo. My father could never mention it, and it affected the family well into the fourth generation as a dark and unexplainable gesture. It made my father and his father desperate to be accepted, to be conventional, and comfortable. It made them commit themselves to an ostensibly easy bourgeois world. They saw it so precariously, but the reason was never mentioned. I first learned about it after my father died."[5]Gurney told The Washington Post in 1982:Gurney has also written several novels, including:[6]"
Southampton West End railway station;"Southampton West End served the city of Southampton, Hampshire, England, from 1847 to 1895 on the Southampton and Dorchester Railway (now part of the South West Main Line).The station was opened on 1 June 1847 by the London and South Western Railway Company. The new line connected to the existing Southampton station (later named Southampton Terminus) and Southampton Tunnel was built to take it under the centre of the city. The Act[1] authorising the line required a station to be built at Blechynden Terrace, near the west end of the tunnel, but at first this was omitted due to a legal dispute. However, construction difficulties in the tunnel, including a partial collapse in May 1847, led to the building of a temporary terminus at the Blechynden site. With the tunnel closed, locomotives to be used on the new line were transported by road through the city, and passengers were conveyed across the town by horse-drawn omnibuses.[2][3]A test run through the tunnel was made by a steam engine on 29 July 1847 and the line was fully open from 6 August.[3]In August 1858, Blechynden station was renamed Southampton West End.[4]By the end of 1860, the station had a booking office and two waiting rooms on the up and down platforms. In the late 1880s the station was inadequate for its traffic, so land was bought for a new station nearby and Southampton West (now Central) station was opened on 1 November 1895, while Southampton West End closed to passengers. The date that it was closed completely is unknown, parts of the platforms and buildings, shown to the east of the new station on an Ordnance Survey map published in 1898,[5] remained standing into the 1930s.[6]This article on a railway station in South East England is a stub.

He took part in the London dock strike of 1889, and gained recognition as an able leader.

However, its London members rejected a deal it made in 1911, and when in 1912 it attempted to call a national docks strike, it was a failure, and Anderson chose to stand down.  He remained in his post with the stevedores until his death in 1917.[1][3]"
White lady (cocktail);"White lady (also known as a Delilah,[1] or Chelsea Side-car[1]) is a classic cocktail that is made with gin, cointreau or Triple Sec, fresh lemon juice and an optional egg white.[2] It belongs to the sidecar family, made with gin in place of brandy. The cocktail sometimes also includes additional ingredients, for example egg white, sugar, cream, or creme de menthe.[3]The classic concoction is most commonly served in a Martini cocktail glass. When an egg white is added a champagne coupe is preferable, the silky foam clings more pleasingly to the curved glass.The white lady was made in honor of Eveline Alice Wander Gorkiewicz. Who helped British prisoners of war escape Turkey in the first world war. She would dress up as an old Turkish wash lady (dressed in white) and hide the prisoners in the washing trolley. The drink was named by the soldiers she rescued. The original recipe for the white lady was devised by Harry MacElhone in 1919 at Ciro's Club in London. He originally used crème de menthe, but replaced it with gin at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in 1929.[4][2]According to the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel, the drink was created there by Harry Craddock.[2]A recipe for the white lady made with gin, Cointreau, and fresh lemon juice appears in the Savoy Cocktail Book, published in 1930.[5] Joe Gilmore, former Head Barman at The Savoy, says this was one of Laurel and Hardy's favorite drinks.[6]Early recipes like MacElhone's and Craddock's do not have egg white as one of the recorded ingredients.[2]While sours are characterized by a bright acidity, sidecars are often drier, since they are made with liqueurs (in this case Cointreau) instead of sugar. Sidecars are considered more of a challenge for bartenders because the proportion of ingredients is more difficult to balance for liqueurs of variable sweetness.[7]In John le Carré's 1965 novel The Looking Glass War, the British spy, and main protagonist, Fred Leiser's favorite drink is a white lady and he makes several attempts to get other agents to try the cocktail.In Dorothy Sayers' mystery novel Have His Carcase, Lord Peter has a white lady when he hears about his "Lady" Miss Harriet Vane being in trouble again.It is mentioned in the novel Islands in the Stream by Ernest Hemingway.[4]It is also mentioned in the film, "Inspector Hornleigh" (1938).A mock version of the drink is made in the Japanese manga series Kaguya-sama: Love Is War."
A Taste of Honey (album);"A Taste of Honey is the debut album by the American rhythm and blues group A Taste of Honey. It was produced by Fonce Mizell and Larry Mizell for Sky High Productions and included the number one pop, soul and disco classic "Boogie Oogie Oogie".Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: "Those who cite 'Boogie Oogie Oogie' as definitive disco dumbness should reread the lyrics of 'Tutti Frutti' and think about the great tradition of the left-field girl-group novelty—'Mr. Lee,' 'Iko Iko,' 'Shame, Shame, Shame.' But though a couple of other songs here, notably 'Distant,' indicate that their pan may flash again, late converts are advised to seek out the single and wish they could buy the disco disc."[2]"

Coniochaeta;"The Coniochaeta form a genus of pleomorphic yeasts of the order Coniochaetales and are pathogens of trees.[1] Some species have also been found to form endophytic associations within plants in which they live inside plant tissues but do not actually harm the organism.[2] They can take the form of pink to brown colonies, hyphae, condiophores or sclerotia. In 2013, the Lecythophora were merged with the Coniochaeta, following suggestions by Ziauddin Khan et al.[3]The Coniochaeta have been described as typically associated with wood, water, and soil.[4][5] However, there is also growing evidence of specialised associations between each species and specific environments, and a suggestion that 4-spored and 8-spored species interact differently with their environments, some species surviving forest fires, which activate their sexual cycle.[6]Other members of the Coniochaeta, most commonly Coniochaeta polymorpha, can cause clinical infections in immunocompromised individuals,[3] which has increased recent interest in the genus."

Roger Woodward;"Roger Woodward AC OBE (born 20 December 1942) is an Australian classical and avant-garde pianist, composer, conductor and teacher.The youngest of four children,[1] Roger Woodward was born in Sydney where he received first piano lessons from Winifred Pope.[2] His mother[3] and second sister were amateur violinists and his father[4] and elder sister sang in the local Chatswood Church of Christ choir. On his first day at Chatswood Public School, he sat next to Peter Kraus, a boy who had survived the Auschwitz train four years before. The six-year olds became lifelong friends and, as he came to know Peter, his brother Paul, and the Kraus family, their story impacted his emerging vision and personal development.[5] He attended the Conservatorium High School and matriculated from North Sydney Boys' Technical High School with a Commonwealth scholarship.Woodward's early studies of Bach organ works with Peter Verco led to his immersion in Bach's cantatas and passion music and training in church music with Kenneth R. Long, music master at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney.[6] He performed for the papal organist Fernando Germani[7] and Sir Eugene Goossens, chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra,[8] after which he entered the Sydney Conservatorium in the piano class of Alexander Sverjensky[9] (pupil of Alexander Glazunov, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Alexander Siloti) and the composition class of Raymond Hanson.[10]In 1963, Woodward graduated with distinction from the Sydney Conservatorium and the Sydney Teachers' College.[11] In the same year, he founded and developed plans for the housing and funding of a competitive, international and quadrennial rostrum originally named the Sydney Piano Competition, together with the support of a wide circle of Sydney musicians and enthusiasts, which was achieved during 1972 to 76.[12]From 1963 to 1965, Woodward continued his organ studies with Faunce Allman[13] while carrying out full-time duties as a choir director and secondary school teacher. During this period he mastered works by Australian composers and Tōru Takemitsu,[14] John Cage[15] Olivier Messiaen and his pupils: Alexander Goehr,[16] Karlheinz Stockhausen,[17][18] Iannis Xenakis,[19] Pierre Boulez and Jean Barraqué.[20][21][22][23] In 1964, he won the Commonwealth Finals of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Instrumental and Vocal Competition, the prize for which was to perform throughout Australia with the six ABC State Radio orchestras and in multiple radio and television broadcasts.[24]From 1965–69, he pursued postgraduate studies at the National Chopin Academy of Music, Warsaw, with Zbigniew Drzewiecki.[25] There he befriended the Cuban pedagogue Jorge Luis Herrero Dante and soon after, began working with Cuban composers Sergio Barroso, Juan Blanco, Leo Brouwer, and Carlos Fariñas.During visits to London (1966–68), Woodward prepared Chopin manuscripts owned by British musicologist Arthur Hedley,[26] before including them in recitals at the Wigmore Hall and South Bank.[27] Contrary to some reports, Woodward did not enter the International Chopin Piano Competition. However, he regularly performed Chopin's music in Poland:[28] at the Twenty-Third International Chopin Festival, Duszniki-Zdrój (1968), at Żelazowa Wola (Chopin's birthplace), at the Kraków Spring Festival (1968) and at the Ostrowski Palace on several occasions. He also performed the complete works of Chopin (by heart) at the Sydney Festival 1983-1985 in support of the Solidarność Movement to raise public awareness of the importance of Poland's struggle for human rights.In 1967, Woodward played for Lina Prokofieva in Warsaw[29] and was soon invited to perform with the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra throughout Poland.[30] Two years later, he toured extensively with the Wiener Trio[31] performed in Cuba[32] as guest of Casa de las Américas and at the Paris Jeunesses Musicales where the UNESCO Rostrum's two principal jury members, Yehudi Menuhin and Jack Lang, noticed Woodward's performances of his own compositions[33] alongside works of J. S. Bach, Chopin, Scriabin and Prokofiev. Soon after he made his debut with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra[34] at the Royal Festival Hall, London and on Menuhin's recommendation, his first four recordings for EMI.[35]In 1971, Woodward performed his first recital at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall[36] with premieres of works by Richard Meale, Ross Edwards, Leo Brouwer, Takemitsu and Barraqué,[37][38] after which he was invited by Robert Slotover, CEO, Allied Artists Management, to co-found a series of new music concerts known as the London Music Digest[39] at the Roundhouse.Digest performances with Barraqué[40] were followed by a close working relationship with the composer on his Sonate pour piano[41][42][43][44] at the EMI Abbey Road Studios, then in Paris and at the Royan Festival. Woodward also worked with John Cage at the Roundhouse[45] for the British premiere of HPSCHD for ICES (International Carnival of Experimental Sound) and the BBC Proms. Further collaborations were undertaken with Stockhausen at the Festival Hall, London,[46][17] and with Takemitsu at the Roundhouse,[47] [48] London's Decca Studios, and the Music Today Festival, Tokyo.[49]A partnership also began with Pierre Boulez and the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Roundhouse,[50] the Cheltenham Festival,[51] and with Bernard Rands for the premiere of Mésallianz for piano and orchestra. His collaboration with Iannis Xenakis 1974–96[52] extended from France to the UK, Austria, Italy, and the United States,[19] during which Xenakis dedicated three works to him, as did Rolf Gehlhaar,[53] Takemitsu,[54] Anne Boyd,[55] and Morton Feldman.[56] Performing their works established his reputation as the leading exponent of new music of his time.Steeped in church music and traditional repertoire, Woodward trained throughout his early life to perform established works side by side with more recent music as part of a belief that music was the essential expression of an experimental process. His concerts reflected this belief even though such programming was widely considered unorthodox for the time.[57] He placed new works by Anne Boyd and Richard Meale alongside those of Scriabin, late Beethoven and J.S. Bach at the Edinburgh Festival.[58] In Los Angeles, for the first half of three Los Angeles Philharmonic concerts,[59] he performed Liszt's Totentanz and Xenakis alongside J.S. Bach solo harpsichord concertos with the Tokyo String Quartet. In recital, he often programmed traditional eighteenth- and nineteenth-century repertoire with new, little known, or neglected works such as those he championed by experimental fin de siècle Russian, Ukrainian and early Soviet composers[60] Alexander Scriabin, Alexander Mosolov, Nikolai Roslavets, Ivan Vyshnegradsky, Nikolai Obukhov, Aleksei Stanchinsky.[61] His performances of the complete works of Scriabin attracted exceptional critical reviews.[62]In 1973, Woodward worked with Stockhausen and Jerzy Romaniuk [pl] on Mantra for two ring-modulated pianos at Imperial College London (Lecture 7 in 3 parts),[63] with Anne Boyd in Sussex, UK, on Angklung, and with Takemitsu on the premiere of For Away, Corona ("London version"), and the recording of his complete piano music to that point in London's Decca studios. That September, he participated in the inaugural celebrations of the Sydney Opera House as soloist for an extended tour with the six principal Australian Broadcasting Commission orchestras and premiered a series of ABC commissions, including a septet, As It Leaves the Bell, by Anne Boyd for piano, two harps and percussion.January 1974 saw Woodward invited by Witold Rowicki on an extensive tour of the US with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra,[65] during which he made his debut at Carnegie Hall.[66] That year, Woodward founded Music Rostrum Australia at the Sydney Opera House where he collaborated with Australian composer Richard Meale and guests Luciano Berio, Cathy Berberian, David Gulpilil and Yuji Takahashi. He began performing with the Cleveland Orchestra directed by Lorin Maazel,[67] and became a regular guest in Los Angeles with the Philharmonic directed by Zubin Mehta,[68] with whom he subsequently performed (1972–89) in New York, Tel Aviv, and Paris.[69] He appeared regularly at Festival d'automne à Paris [fr][70] BBC Promenade Concerts,[71] at Teatro La Fenice for La Biennale di Venezia (with Péter Eötvös and the Norddeutscher Rundfunkorchester),[72] Warszawska Jesień, Festival Internacional Cervantino, Wien Modern[73] with Claudio Abbado,[29] at the New York Piano Festival,[74] Festival de la Roque d'Anthéron and at the Ferme de Meslay [fr], Touraine, at the invitation of its artistic director, Sviatoslav Richter.[75]In 1992, Woodward directed an all-Xenakis program at Scala di Milano.[76] He also performed at outdoor venues including the Hollywood Bowl (Stravinsky), Odéon of Herodes Atticus, Athens[77]  On four occasions he performed with Cecil Taylor in the Gulbenkian Park, Lisbon (1986–92) and on several occasions at The Domain with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra (Beethoven and Tchaikovsky). In traditions pioneered by Dame Nellie Melba and Percy Grainger, he performed extensively throughout Central and Regional Australia, often in outdoor venues.In 1975, he premiered Morton Feldman's Piano and Orchestra[78] with the Saarbrücken Rundfunkorchester at the Rencontres internationales de musique contemporaine [fr] (Metz Festival) (in the composer's presence) directed by Hans Zender. It was the year when Woodward first encountered Anne Boyd's a cappella masterpiece: As I Crossed a Bridge of Dreams, which made a profound impact upon him. [79] Then in June and July, as Dmitri Shostakovich lay dying in a Moscow Cancer Clinic, he made the first complete recording in the West of his 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 87, in tribute to the great Russian composer.In 1977, he premiered Feldman's solo work Piano[80] (which was dedicated to Woodward)[81]  in Baden- Baden, commissioned Elisabeth Lutyens for a work for solo piano and two chamber orchestras, (Nox, Op.118),[82] and, following the Valldemosa Festival, began a collaboration with Alberto Ginastera which continued until 1979. 1978 saw his first performance of the complete cycle of Beethoven's 32 Piano Sonatas at the Adelaide Festival, repeated at Kenwood House, London, the following year and in 1980 for the Sydney Festival. In the same year he premiered the Xenakis solo piano work Mists in Edinburgh (in the composer's presence). A further performance of the Beethoven cycle followed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. At London's Institute of Contemporary Arts, he gave the world premiere of Morton Feldman's Triadic Memories[83] in the presence of the composer—a ninety-minute masterpiece which heralded the composer's late period.In 1982, Woodward performed the five Beethoven Piano Concertos on three occasions: with Elyakum Shapirra and the Adelaide Chamber Orchestra, and twice with Georg Tintner, first with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and then with the Queensland Theatre Orchestra.[84] During this time he was active for the Polish Solidarność Trades Union Movement, leading to his being banned from performing throughout Eastern Europe. As the ban took hold elsewhere. it was accompanied by misleading statements, rumours and damaging criticism from the Soviet Block. Throughout this period the artist remained loyal to the Solidarność Trades Union Movement, leading to his being banned not only in Eastern Europe but, unexpectedly, by some leading Western concert managements, festival directors, and symphony orchestra administrators. Despite this, he was the recipient of a second work (of three dedicated to him) by Xenakis—his third and final composition for piano and orchestra—Keqrops,[85] which was premiered in November 1986 at the Lincoln Center, NY, with New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Mehta,[86] The following year, he repeated Keqrops for the BBC Proms (again in the composer's presence). That year, he also performed Barraqué at De Ysbreeker [nl], Amsterdam, premiered Áskell Másson's Piano Concerto in Reykjavik (again in the composer's presence),[87] and, in 1989 Rolf Gehlhaar' Diagonal Flying in Geneva together with the composer.[88] That same year Woodward founded the Sydney Spring International Festival of New Music which continued until 2001.Despite the downfall of Communism, the former Soviet disinformation campaign continued, with repeated attempts to remove Solidarność activists' credibility and careers through an ongoing embargo. Nevertheless, Woodward worked with the New York, Los Angeles, Beijing and Israel Philharmonic orchestras, five London orchestras, the Hallé Orchestra, London Sinfonietta, London Mozart Players, London Brass, RTE Radio, the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra, the Scottish National Orchestra, the Estonian National Orchestra, the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and Berlin Radio Orchestra, L'orchestre National de Paris, L'orchestre National de Lille, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Mahlerjugendorchester, EEC Youth Orchestra, the Australian Youth Orchestra, and the Budapest and Prague Chamber Orchestras. He also collaborated with the following artists: Charles Dutoit, Lorin Maazel, Yoel Levi, Edo de Waart, Sir Charles Mackerras, Enrique Bátiz Campbell, Kurt Masur,[89] Nello Santi, Paavo Berglund, Moshe Atzmon, Marin Alsop, Henry Kripps, Tibor Paul, Albert Rosen, Werner Andreas Albert, Matthias Bamert, Henry Lewis, Isaiah Jackson, Dean Dixon, Georg Tintner, Hans-Hubert Schönzeler, Tan Lihua, Sir William Southgate, Simon Romanos, Gyula Németh, David Atherton, Erich Leinsdorf, Eliahu Inbal, James Judd, Walter Susskind, Herbert Blomstedt, Georges Tzipine, Arturo Tamayo, Robert Busan, Lukas Foss, Péter Eötvös, Zakarias Grafilo, Sir John Pritchard, Sir Roger Norrington, Sir Andrew Davis, Willem van Otterloo, Hiroyuki Iwaki, Lamberto Gardelli, Colman Pearce, and Sir Alexander Gibson.[citation needed] Although the embargo was extensive, Woodward and other Australian artists were invited by Symphony Australia to perform a limited number of orchestral concerts, after the personal intervention of Prime Minister Paul Keating. Throughout this period, he performed with the Arditti, Tokyo, New Zealand, Australian and Sydney string quartets, the Australia Ensemble, the Edinburgh String Quartet, JACK Quartet and the Alexander String Quartet, with whom he recorded Beethoven,[90] Chopin,[91] Shostakovich,[92] and Robert Greenberg.[93] He also collaborated with harpsichordist George Malcolm and jazz pianist Cecil Taylor in Lisbon, Paris, for the Patras Festival, and for extensive tours of the UK Contemporary Music Network from 1987–94. He worked with musicologists Charles Rosen, Paul Griffiths, H. C. Robbins-Landon, Richard Toop, Paul M. Ellison, Nouritza Matossian and Sharon Kanach, violinists Philippe Hirschhorn, Ivry Gitlis, Ilya Grubert, Winfried Rademacher,  Asmira-Woodward-Page and Wanda Wiłkomirska, violist James Creitz [de], cellists Rohan de Saram, Nathan Waks, Jacopo Scalfi and David Pereira, Synergy Percussion, Chris Dench, Adrian Jack, Elena Kats-Chernin, Alessandro Solbiati, the flautists Laura Chislett, Pierre Yves- Artaud, pianists: Yuji Takahashi, Alexander Gavrylyuk, Stephanie McCallum, Robert Curry, Noel Lee and Simon Tedeschi. He also worked with James Dillon, James Morrison, David Gulpilil, Robyn Archer and Frank Zappa. Nominated by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Premier Neville Wran, Woodward became a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1992. The following year, Polish President Lech Wałęsa, conferred his nation's highest honour upon a foreigner—the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (OM).During the 1990s Woodward toured China twice,[94] co-founded and directed the Kötschach-Mauthner Musikfest (1992–97),[95] the Joie et Lumière concert series (under the patronage of Lord Paul Hamlyn and Lady Helen Hamlyn) at Château de Bagnols, Bourgogne 1997–2004,[96] in tribute to the memory of Sviatoslav Richter, and an annual concert series—the Sydney Spring International Festival of New Music 1989–2001, when he collaborated with Arvo Pärt and Horatiu Radulescu.[97] He commissioned a series of three piano concertos from Larry Sitsky. The first was premiered at the 1994 Sydney Spring International Festival of New Music and recorded in 1997. In 1995 it was selected by the UNESCO International Rostrum of Composers for citation. Between 1992-98 he was awarded four doctorates honoris causa[98] and in 1999, completed the degree of Doctor of Music at the University of Sydney.Woodward's performances as a conductor received wide critical acclaim: with the Adelaide Chamber Orchestra,[99] the Sydney Dance Company at the Sydney Opera House in a collaboration with its artistic director Graeme Murphy in twenty-five performances of the Xenakis ballet Kraanerg,[100][101][102] the Shanghai Conservatory Orchestra, in the UK for BBC2 Television,[103] with the Alpha Centauri Ensemble (twenty-three musicians) at Scala di Milano,[104] and in the Festival d'automne à Paris [fr][105] the Academia Santa Cecilia, Rome, at the Biblioteca Salaborsa, Bologna,[106] and for the Sydney Spring International Festival of New Music (1989–2001).[107] His compositions have been performed in Poland, Australia, Cuba, the Netherlands, France, and the UK at the Almeida International New Music Festival (August, 1990).

Kirchberg v. Feenstra;"Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455 (1981), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held a Louisiana Head and Master law, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband and indicate the husband's dominance over the wife in the marriage, unconstitutional.[1][2]In 1974, Joan Feenstra charged her husband Harold had molested their daughter. Harold hired an attorney, Karl Kirchberg, to defend himself against the charges, and mortgaged the Feenstras' home toward paying the cost of that attorney. Joan was not informed of this mortgage because Head and Master provisions of Louisiana law allowed him to do so without her consent or knowledge. She dropped the charges, and the couple separated. Joan did not learn about the mortgage until 1976, when Harold's attorney returned to demand payment and threatened foreclosure.[1] She then filed a lawsuit arguing that Louisiana's laws giving sole control of marital property to the husband were unconstitutional.The district court upheld Louisiana's law. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit overturned the district court, finding the law unconstitutionally violated the Equal Protection Clause, but limited the application of their ruling to future decisions. Feenstra appealed to the Supreme Court.[3]Applying intermediate scrutiny as they had in Craig v. Boren, the court held that Louisiana's law lacked an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for its sex-based classification, and therefore was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[2][4]In 1980, during the appeals process, Louisiana changed their laws to eliminate the Head and Master provisions.[2][5]In 2015, during oral arguments in the same-sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg used the example of the Supreme Court's striking down of Louisiana's Head and Master rule in Kirchberg v. Feenstra to illustrate how "traditional" concepts of marriage had been revised over time.[6]We have changed our idea about marriage is the point that I made earlier. Marriage today is not what it was under the common law tradition, under the civil law tradition. Marriage was a relationship of a dominant male to a subordinate female. That ended as a result of this Court’s decision in 1982 when Louisiana’s Head and Master Rule was struck down. And no State was allowed to have such a—such a marriage anymore. Would that be a choice that a State should be allowed to have?This article related to the Supreme Court of the United States is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

He studied under the guidance of the cardiologist Floreal Ferrara.[1]He led the ANMAT from 2008 to 2010, and advised the Carta Abierta group on health-related issues.[2]He was appointed minister of health in Argentina, on 26 February 2015. Replacing Juan Luis Manzur.[2] Kirchnerism could not achieve a victory for Daniel Scioli in the 2015 presidential election that allowed him to prevent a ballotage, and runs for a runoff election against Mauricio Macri. Kirchnerism reacted with a negative campaigning against Macri. Gollan said, in his Twitter account, "The 12 new radiation therapy centers to treat cancer will continue if Scioli is president. Think well before you vote". The opposition asked for his resignation, and Gollan deleted the post and claimed that his account had been hacked. Still, his previous posts had a similar tone.[3] Anyhow, the statements in this negative campaigning showed to be true, as after Scioli lost the election and Mauricio Macri become the President of Argentina, many hospitals were closed,[4] Argentina's public health system was seriously deteriorated [5][6] and the Health Ministry itself was demoted to a Secretariat, with lower budget and less decision powers.[7]Ahead of the 2021 primary elections, Gollán was confirmed as the second candidate in the Frente de Todos list to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in Buenos Aires Province. He resigned from his post as Health Minister of the province on 28 July 2021 to focus on the campaign, and was succeeded by his vice-minister, Nicolás Kreplak.[8]"
Von Hippel–Lindau disease;"Von Hippel–Lindau disease (VHL), also known as Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder with multisystem involvement.[2] It is characterized by visceral cysts and benign tumors with potential for subsequent malignant transformation. It is a type of phakomatosis that results from a mutation in the Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3p25.3.[3][4][5]Signs and symptoms associated with VHL disease include headaches, problems with balance and walking, dizziness, weakness of the limbs, vision problems, and high blood pressure.Conditions associated with VHL disease include angiomatosis, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cysts (pancreatic serous cystadenoma), endolymphatic sac tumor, and bilateral papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis (men) or broad ligament of the uterus (women).[7][8] Angiomatosis occurs in 37.2% of patients presenting with VHL disease and usually occurs in the retina. As a result, loss of vision is very common. However, other organs can be affected: strokes, heart attacks, and cardiovascular disease are common additional symptoms.[5] Approximately 40% of VHL disease presents with CNS hemangioblastomas and they are present in around 60-80%. Spinal hemangioblastomas are found in 13-59% of VHL disease and are specific because 80% are found in VHL disease.[9][10] Although all of these tumours are common in VHL disease, around half of cases present with only one tumour type.[10]The disease is caused by mutations of the Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) gene on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26). There are over 1500 germline mutations and somatic mutations found in VHL disease.[11][12]Every cell in the body has 2 copies of every gene (bar those found in the sex chromosomes, X and Y). In VHL disease, one copy of the VHL gene has a mutation and produces a faulty VHL protein (pVHL). However, the second copy still produces a functional protein. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner - one copy of the faulty gene is sufficient to increase the risk of developing tumours.[13][14]Approximately 20% of cases of VHL disease are found in individuals without a family history, known as de novo mutations. An inherited mutation of the VHL gene is responsible for the remaining 80 percent of cases.[9]30-40% of mutations in the VHL gene consist of 50-250kb deletion mutations that remove either part of the gene or the whole gene and flanking regions of DNA. The remaining 60-70% of VHL disease is caused by the truncation of pVHL by nonsense mutations, indel mutations or splice site mutations.[9]The VHL protein (pVHL) is involved in the regulation of a protein known as hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). This is a subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor that at normal cellular oxygen levels is highly regulated. In normal physiological conditions, pVHL recognizes and binds to HIF1α only when oxygen is present due to the post translational hydroxylation of 2 proline residues within the HIF1α protein. pVHL is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates HIF1α and causes its degradation by the proteasome. In low oxygen conditions or in cases of VHL disease where the VHL gene is mutated, pVHL does not bind to HIF1α. This allows the subunit to dimerise with HIF1β and activate the transcription of a number of genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor B, erythropoietin and genes involved in glucose uptake and metabolism.[14][15] A new novel missense mutation in VHL genes c.194 C>T, c.239 G>A, c.278 G>A, c.319 C>G, c.337 C>G leading to the following variations p.Ala 65 Val, p.Gly 80 Asp, p.Gly 93 Glu, p.Gln 107 Glu, p.Gln 113 Glu[check spelling] in the protein contributed to renal clear cell carcinoma.[16]The detection of tumours specific to VHL disease is important in the disease's diagnosis. In individuals with a family history of VHL disease, one hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma or renal cell carcinoma may be sufficient to make a diagnosis. As all the tumours associated with VHL disease can be found sporadically, at least two tumours must be identified to diagnose VHL disease in a person without a family history.[9][10]Genetic diagnosis is also useful in VHL disease diagnosis. In hereditary VHL disease, techniques such as the Southern blot and gene sequencing can be used to analyse DNA and identify mutations. These tests can be used to screen family members of those afflicted with VHL disease, de novo cases that produce genetic mosaicism are more difficult to detect because mutations are not found in the white blood cells that are used for genetic analysis.[9][17]VHL disease can be subdivided according to the clinical manifestations, although these groups often correlate with certain types of mutations present in the VHL gene.[18]Early recognition and treatment of specific manifestations of VHL can substantially decrease complications and improve quality of life. For this reason, individuals with VHL disease are usually screened routinely for retinal angiomas, CNS hemangioblastomas, clear-cell renal carcinomas and pheochromocytomas.[19] CNS hemangioblastomas are usually surgically removed if they are symptomatic. Photocoagulation and cryotherapy are usually used for the treatment of symptomatic retinal angiomas, although anti-angiogenic treatments may also be an option. Renal tumours may be removed by a partial nephrectomy or other techniques such as radiofrequency ablation.[9]Belzutifan is a drug under investigation for the treatment of von Hippel–Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma.[20][21][22][23]VHL disease has an incidence of one in 36,000 births. There is over 90% penetrance by the age of 65.[24] Age at diagnosis varies from infancy to age 60–70 years, with an average patient age at clinical diagnosis of 26 years.[citation needed]The German ophthalmologist Eugen von Hippel first described angiomas in the eye in 1904.[25] Arvid Lindau described the angiomas of the cerebellum and spine in 1927.[26] The term Von Hippel–Lindau disease was first used in 1936, however, its use became common only in the 1970s.[9]Some descendants of the McCoy family (involved in the Hatfield-McCoy feud of Appalachia, USA) are presumed to have VHL. In an article appearing in the Associated Press, it has been speculated by a Vanderbilt University endocrinologist that the hostility underlying the Hatfield–McCoy feud may have been partly due to the consequences of Von Hippel–Lindau disease. The article suggests that the McCoy family was predisposed to bad tempers because many of them had a pheochromocytoma which produced excess adrenaline and a tendency toward explosive tempers.[27]Other uncommon names are: angiomatosis retinae, familial cerebello-retinal angiomatosis, cerebelloretinal hemangioblastomatosis, Hippel Disease, Hippel–Lindau syndrome, HLS, VHL, Lindau disease or retinocerebellar angiomatosis.[28][29]"
Elections in the Czech Republic;"All elections in the Czech Republic are based on the principle of universal suffrage. Any adult citizen who is at least 18 years old can vote, except those who have been stripped of their legal capacities by a court, usually on the basis of mental illness. Elected representatives are elected directly by the citizens without any intermediaries. Election laws are not part of the constitution, but – unlike regular laws – they cannot be changed without the consensus of both houses of the Parliament.[1] The Czech Republic uses a two-round plurality voting system for the presidential and Senate elections and an open party-list proportional representation system for all other elections. The proportional representation system uses the D'Hondt method for allocating seats.Elections are usually held over two days, from 14:00 to 22:00 on Friday and then from 8:00 to 14:00 on Saturday.Any citizen aged 40 or over can stand for president, unless they have already served two terms in the office or have been found guilty of treason by the Constitutional Court. From 1993 to 2008, presidents were elected by both houses of the Parliament in three rounds of voting. Since the 2013 election the president is elected directly by the people in two rounds, where the top two candidates from the first round face each other again in the second round. Presidents are elected for five-year terms.Any citizen aged 21 or over can stand as a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, which consists of 200 members elected for four-year terms. The Chamber of Deputies elections do not necessarily take place at fixed intervals as the Chamber of Deputies can be prematurely dissolved by the president, under conditions set by the Constitution. The president also decides the date of the elections, thereby starting the official election campaign, during which political parties' spending is capped by the law.There are 14 voting districts for elections to the Chamber of Deputies, which correspond to the regions of the Czech Republic. Each of these voting districts has a different number of seats available, and parties submit ranked lists of candidates for each district. Candidates of a political party can only win a seat if their party received at least 5% of all valid votes nationally. Voters must choose only one political party to vote for, but they may use up to four preferential votes for particular candidates of that party, which affect the final order of the candidates on the party list. After the elections, the president nominates somebody (usually the head of the winning party) to form a new Cabinet.Any citizen aged 40 or over can become a senator. The Senate consists of 81 members, elected for six-year terms. Elections are held every two years, with one third of Senate seats contested each time. The country is divided into 81 senate constituencies with roughly the same number of voters. The elections consist of two rounds, in which the top two candidates from the first round face each other again in the second round. The Senate elections – and especially the second rounds – have had the lowest voter turnouts of all Czech elections.Any citizen aged 21 or over can represent the Czech Republic as a member of the European Parliament. The Czech Republic is assigned 22 out of 736 mandates in the European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament are elected for five-year terms. There is only one constituency and one list of candidates for the entire Czech Republic. Voters must choose one political party to vote for, but can use up to two preferential votes for particular candidates of that party, which affect the final order of the candidates on the party list.Any citizen aged 18 or over can become a regional councilor. There are 13 regional councils, one for each region of the Czech Republic except the capital, Prague. The City Council of Prague has a special status and acts as both regional and municipal council. Members of regional councils are elected for four-year terms. Their number varies across the regions from 45 to 65. Candidates of a political party can only win a seat if their party gained at least 5% of all valid votes. Voters must choose one political party to vote for, but they can also use up to four preferential votes  for particular candidates of that party, which affect the final order of the candidates on the party list. Voters can only vote in the region where they have registered their permanent address.Unlike in the case of the national cabinet, there is no individual person nominated to form a new regional cabinet. Whichever coalition forms a majority in the regional council chooses the president of the regional cabinet. Political parties can switch sides, end their support for the current president of the regional council and form a new regional cabinet without the need for early elections.Any citizen aged 18 or over can become a municipal councilor. Municipal councilors are elected for four-year terms. Voters can only vote in the municipality where they have registered their permanent address. The number of councilors for each municipality varies from 5 to 55. Each voter has a number of votes corresponding to the number of seats in that particular municipal council, which can be distributed freely across candidates of all political parties.For a party to be eligible for representation, the total number of votes for a party divided by the number of seats in the municipal council and multiplied by the number of candidates nominated by that party must exceed 5% of the total number of valid votes cast in the municipality. The number of votes for a candidate of a party in proportion to the number of all votes cast for that party affects the final order of candidates on the party list.The Constitution of the Czech Republic mentions referendums only in the context of "a referendum concerning the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union".[2] There are no other provisions concerning referendums. As such, the only state-wide referendum ever held in the Czech Republic was the Czech European Union membership referendum in 2003. The government of the Czech Republic approved a referendum bill in 2005,[3] but it was never passed by the parliament."
Outdoor education;"Outdoor education is organized learning that takes place in the outdoors. Outdoor education programs sometimes involve residential or journey wilderness-based experiences in which students participate in a variety of adventurous challenges and outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, canoeing, ropes courses and group games.  Outdoor education draws upon the philosophy, theory, and practices of experiential education and environmental education.Outdoor education has diverse goals and practices, but always involves learning about, in, and through the outdoors.Outdoor education can be simply defined as experiential learning in, for, or about the outdoors. The term 'outdoor education', however, is used broadly to refer to a range of organized activities that take place in a variety of ways in predominantly outdoor environments. Common definitions of outdoor education are difficult to achieve because interpretations vary according to culture, philosophy, and local conditions.[1]Outdoor education is often referred to as synonymous with outdoor learning, outdoor school, forest schools and wilderness education. Outdoor education often uses or draws upon related elements and/or informs related areas. The hallmark of outdoor education is its focus on the "outdoor" side of this education, whereas adventure education would focus on the adventure side and environmental education would focus on environmental.  Expeditionary education involves expeditions into wilderness "where man is but a visitor." All of these activities typically involve experiential education."Education outside the classroom" describes school curriculum learning, other than with a class of students sitting in a room with a teacher and books. It encompasses biology field trips and searching for insects in the school garden, as well as indoor activities like observing stock control in a local shop, or visiting a museum. It is a concept currently enjoying a revival because of the recognition of benefits from the more active style. The Education and Skills Committee[2] of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom has reported that it brings history and art to life, develops social skills, and clearly enhances geography and science.,.[3] There are key policies in place for outdoor learning in England,[4] Scotland[5] and Wales.Despite the evidence supporting an extension of outdoor learning for children, there are a number of obstacles in the way. One of these obstacles is risk aversion amongst teachers, parents and others, raising reluctance to such diverse and physical tasks. The journalist Tim Gill has written about parental and institutional risk aversion affecting many activities with children in his book "No Fear".[6]  Another obstacle is the perceived high cost of facilitating outdoor learning. Creating an outdoor learning environment needn't cost a great deal, however. The UK Early Years Framework Stage, which outlines best practice in Early Years teaching, asserts that: "Outdoor learning is more effective when adults focus on what children need to be able to do rather than what children need to have. An approach that considers experiences rather than equipment places children at the centre of learning and ensures that individual children's learning and developmental needs are taken account of and met effectively"[7]Linda Tallent, a UK-based educational consultant who has worked extensively with schools to develop their outdoor spaces into learning environments, agrees. She believes that by focusing on activities and skill development, it is possible to develop an outdoor learning curriculum on a 'shoe string'.[8] She cites a comment by Will Nixon, who reminds readers that 'Using the real world is the way learning has happened for 99.9% of human existence. Only in the last hundred years have we put it into a little box called a classroom.'.[9] Tallent also refers to evidence from a number of studies that the most effective way of learning is through participation, and calls on educators to make a special effort to create opportunities for children to participate in their learning.Some typical aims of outdoor education are to:Outdoor education spans the three domains of self, others, and the natural world. The relative emphasis of these three domains varies from one program to another. An outdoor education program can, for example, emphasize one (or more) of these aims to:Outdoor education is often used as a means to create a deeper sense of place for people in a community. Sense of place is manifested through the understanding and connection that one has with the area in which they reside. Sense of place is an important aspect of environmentalism as well as environmental justice because it makes the importance of sustaining a particular ecosystem that much more personal to an individual.[10]Modern outdoor education owes its beginnings to separate initiatives. Organized camping was evident in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in Europe, the UK, the US, Australia, and New Zealand. The Scouting movement, established in the UK in 1907 by Robert Baden-Powell, employs non-formal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities. The first Outward Bound centre at Aberdyfi in Wales was established during the Second World War. The Forest schools of Denmark are examples of European programs with similar aims and objectives.Key outdoor education pioneers include Kurt Hahn, a German educator who founded schools such as the Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, the United World Colleges movement, the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme (which emphasizes community service, craftsmanship skills, physical skill, and outdoor expeditions), and the Outward Bound movement.The second half of the twentieth century saw rapid growth of outdoor education in all sectors (state, voluntary, and commercial) with an ever-widening range of client groups and applications. In this period Outward Bound spread to over 40 countries, including the US in the 1960s. Other US based outdoor education programs include Project Adventure and the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). Project Adventure focuses on day use of ropes courses. NOLS uses the outdoor setting to train leaders for outdoor programs and for other settings including training every new US astronaut and 10% of the US Naval Academy. The Association for Experiential Education is a professional association for "experiential" educators. The Wilderness Education Association (WEA) is a consortium of college outdoor education programs with a standard curriculum based on an academic model. (See also North America in the Around the World section.)A history of outdoor education in the UK has been documented by Lyn Cook (1999),[11] and a history of outdoor education in New Zealand has been published in Pip Lynch's Camping in the Curriculum (2007).[12]Philosophy and theory about outdoor education tends to emphasize the effect of natural environments on human beings, the educative role of stress and challenge, and experiential learning.[1]One view is that participants are at their "rawest" level when outdoors because they are "stripped" of many of the conveniences of modern life. Participants can become more aware that they are part of a greater ecosystem and are not as bound by social customs and norms. In essence participants can be true to themselves and more able to see others as people regardless of race, class, religion etc. Outdoor education also helps instill the basic elements of teamwork because participants often need to work together and rely on others. For many people a high ropes course or an outdoor activity may stretch their comfort zone and cause them to challenge themselves physically which in turn can lead to challenging oneself mentally.[citation needed]The roots of modern outdoor education can be found in the philosophical work of:Foundational work on the philosophy of outdoor education includes work by:A wide range of social science and specific outdoor education theories and models have been applied in an effort to better understand outdoor education. Amongst the key theoretical models or concepts are:Outdoor education occurs, in one form or another, in most if not all countries of the world. However, it can be implemented very differently, depending on the cultural context. Some countries, for example, view outdoor education as synonymous with environmental education, whilst other countries treat outdoor education and environmental education as distinct. Modern forms of outdoor education are most prevalent in the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and to some extent Asia and Africa.[citation needed][14] Many outdoor Education programs were cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.The English Outdoor Council, an umbrella body, defines outdoor education as a way for students and teachers to be fully engaged in a lesson, all the while embracing the outdoors. The EOC deems outdoor education as "providing depth to the curriculum and makes an important contribution to students' physical, personal and social education.".[15] In the UK, Learning through Landscapes champion the use of School Grounds as a cost effective, easily accessible place of learning and play.  Forest School.[16] is also fashionable in the UK, providing a very specialist approach to personal development within the wider context of Outdoor Learning.Throughout Australia & New Zealand many school students undertake outdoor / outdoor and environmental education. Aust / NZ have several outdoor education degrees and vocational outdoor recreation programs. Once teachers and outdoor leaders have completed their studies, many have opportunities to work in schools, private organizations or various outdoor education centres in either country. Outdoor Education is mandated as part of the New Zealand Health and Physical Education as one of the 7 key areas of learning. The Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority with support from Outdoor Education Australia has developed curriculum documents to support schools to conduct outdoor education throughout the country primarily through the learning areas of Science, Health and Physical Education and Humanities.Environmental education, most notably outdoor education in Canada is seen through outdoor camp and residential programs, school-based programs and commercial travel operations. Outdoor education in Canada is based around "hard" technical skills—often travel and camping skills—and the "soft"—group skills and personal growth qualities—are blended with, one might say, the "green" and "warm" skills of a complementary eco-adventure focus."[17] Adventures are found whether one is partaking in environmental awareness or team-building workshops throughout Canada. Denmark is known as one of the more environmentally conscious countries in the developed world. One of the ways in which this presents itself, is through the forest school system that exists there. Children are taught in the woods using nature and animals to learn about basic environmental education as well as the fundamental elementary education that is required.[18]At Finnish schools, the term “outdoor education” represents teaching and learning that takes place outside the classroom with the aim to achieve goals in the National core curriculum for basic education as and in the National core curriculum for upper secondary schools. In the upper secondary schools (students aged 16–18), the theme is “Sustainabledevelopment”. Students are encouraged to pursue a sustainable lifestyle, to take action for sustainable development, and to examine the challenges of SD.[19] Some vocational institutes offer secondary lever degree in Nature and Environmental Studies focusing mainly to tourism and experience industries.[20] Humak University of Applied Sciences offers a bachelor's degree in Adventure and Outdoor Education in its English language programme focusing on the technical skills for the adventure sports and pedagogy, tourism and entrepreneurship. Annually 20 students are taken in to the programme.[21] In addition Humak University of Applied Sciences offers updating education for teachers and persons active in adventure sports in their Open University of Applied Sciences.[22]Alain Kerjean founded in 1986 "Hors Limites-Outward Bound France", adaptation to adults of active pedagogy and introduces in France apprentissage par l'expérience movement. The first Latin country member of this network. Honnor president : SAS Prince Albert of Monaco. In 1994 was founded two bodies : Association Apprendre par l'expérience (youth), and SARL Expérientiel (corporate). From 2008, Alain Kerjean develops Outdoor Education for universities in Romania and advises in France training organizations wishing to design programs based on this pedagogy. His books and articles make available Anglo-Saxon research and publications on the subject to the French public.[citation needed]The first major and highly publicized outdoor learning project was Ruta Quetzal. Launched with assistance of king Juan Carlos in 1979, it was heavily focused on exploring cross-Atlantic Hispanidad cultural links and for decades was managed by the adventurer and media celebrity, Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo. The project is ongoing. There are numerous similar though less ambitious schemes currently operational, e.g. Rumbo al Sur, annual tours in Africa managed by a TV reality-show star Telmo Aldaz de la Quadra-Salcedo.[23]There is much anecdotal evidence about benefits of outdoor education experiences, teachers, for example, often speak of the improvement they have in relationships with students following a trip. However, hard evidence showing that outdoor education has a demonstrable long-term effect on behaviour or educational achievement is harder to identify, this may be in part because of the difficulty involved in conducting studies which separate out the effects of outdoor education on meaningful outcomes.A major meta-analysis of 97 empirical studies indicated a positive overall effect of adventure education programs on outcomes such as self-concept, leadership, and communication skills.[24]  This study also indicated that there appeared to be ongoing positive effects. The largest empirical study of the effects of outdoor education programs (mostly Outward Bound programs) found small-moderate short-term positive impacts on a diverse range of generic life skills, with the strongest outcomes for longer, expedition-based programs with motivated young adults, and partial long-term retention of these gains.[25]In "Adventure in a Bun", Chris Loynes[26] has suggested that outdoor education is increasingly an entertainment park consumption experience. In a paper entitled "The Generative Paradigm",[27] Loynes has also called for an increase in "creativity, spontaneity and vitality". Outdoor education has been found more beneficial to those students who find classroom learning more challenging[citation needed]. Maynard, Waters & Clement (2013)[28]  found that, resonating with their previous findings, the teachers in their study reported "that when engaged in child-initiated activity in the outdoor environment, over half of the children who in the classroom were perceived to be 'underachieving' appeared to behave differently" (p. 221). Their work aims to support the notion that the more natural outdoor spaces in which child-initiated activities take place both directly and indirectly diminish the perception of underachievement. This is important because a number of studies have shown that expectations based on perception of students is important for student learning.This may also be due to a non-academic family background, or a personal psychological trait such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.When German children from forest kindergartens went to primary school, teachers observed a significant improvement in reading, writing, mathematics, social interactions and many other areas.[29]  A yearlong study was done where a group of 9th and 12th grade students learned through outdoor education. The focus was on raising the critical thinking skills of the students as a measure of improvement, where critical thinking was defined to be, "the process of purposeful self-regulatory judgment and decision making". The problem solving capabilities included the ability of students to interpret, to analyze, to evaluate, to infer, to explain and to self-regulate. Researchers found that both 9th and 12th graders scored higher than the control groups in critical thinking by a significant amount.[30]Using the Environment as an Integrating Context for learning (EIC) is the foundation of a substantial report[31] which found benefits in learning outside the classroom on standardized measures of academic achievement in reading, writing, math, science, and social studies, reduced discipline problems, and increased enthusiasm for learning and pride in accomplishments.There are several important trends and changing circumstances for outdoor education, including:"
Meanings of minor planet names: 16001–17000;"As minor planet discoveries are confirmed, they are given a permanent number by the IAU's Minor Planet Center (MPC), and the discoverers can then submit names for them, following the IAU's naming conventions. The list below concerns those minor planets in the specified number-range that have received names, and explains the meanings of those names.Official naming citations of newly named small Solar System bodies are approved and published in a bulletin by IAU's Working Group Small Body Nomenclature (WGSBN).[1] Before May 2021, citations were published in MPC's Minor Planet Circulars for many decades.[2] Recent citations can also be found on the JPL Small-Body Database (SBDB).[3] Until his death in 2016, German astronomer Lutz D. Schmadel compiled these citations into the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names (DMP) and regularly updated the collection.[4][5] Based on Paul Herget's The Names of the Minor Planets,[6] Schmadel also researched the unclear origin of numerous asteroids, most of which had been named prior to World War II.  This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: SBDB New namings may only be added to this list below after official publication as the preannouncement of names is condemned.[7] The WGSBN publishes a comprehensive guideline for the naming rules of non-cometary small Solar-System bodies.[8]"
Elderly care;"Elderly care, or simply eldercare (also known in parts of the English-speaking world as aged care), serves the needs and requirements of senior citizens. It encompasses assisted living, adult daycare, long-term care, nursing homes (often called residential care), hospice care, and home care.Elderly care emphasizes the social and personal requirements of senior citizens who wish to age with dignity while needing assistance with daily activities and with healthcare. Much elderly care is unpaid.[1]Elderly care includes a broad range of practices and institutions, as there is a wide variety of elderly care needs and cultural perspectives on the elderly throughout the world.The form of care provided for older adults varies greatly by country and even region,[2] and is changing rapidly.[3] Older people worldwide consume the most health spending of any age group.[4] There is also an increasingly large proportion of older people worldwide, especially in developing nations with continued pressure to limit fertility and shrink families.[5]Traditionally, care for older adults has been the responsibility of family members and was provided within the extended family home.[6] Increasingly in modern societies, care is now provided by state or charitable institutions.[6] The reasons for this change include shrinking families, longer life expectancy and geographical dispersion of families.[6] Although these changes have affected European and North American countries first, they are now increasingly affecting Asian countries.[7]In most western countries, care facilities for older adults are residential family care homes, freestanding assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs).[8] A family care home is a residential home with support and supervisory personnel by an agency, organization, or individual that provides room and board, personal care and habilitation services in a family environment for at least two and no more than six persons.[9]Due to the wide variety of elderly care needs and cultural perspectives on the elderly, there is a broad range of practices and institutions across different parts of the world. For example, in many Asian countries whereby younger generations often care for the elderly due to societal norms, government-run elderly care is seldom used in developing countries throughout Asia due to a lack of sufficient taxation necessary to provide an adequate standard of care, whilst privately-run elderly care in developing countries throughout Asia is relatively uncommon due to the stigma of exhibiting insufficient filial piety, having a relatively relaxed work–life interface and insufficient funding from family to pay for privately-run elderly care. However, institutional elderly care is increasingly adopted across various Asian societies, as the work–life interface becomes more constrained and people with increasing incomes being able to afford the cost of elderly care.According to Family Caregiver Alliance, the majority of family caregivers are women:[10]"Many studies have looked at the role of women as family caregivers. Although not all have addressed gender issues and caregiving specifically, the results are still generalizable [sic] to Aged care in Australia is designed to make sure that every Australian can contribute as much as possible towards their cost of care, depending on their individual income and assets.[11] That means that residents pay only what they can afford, and the Commonwealth government pays what the residents cannot pay. An Australian statutory authority, the Productivity Commission, conducted a review of aged care commencing in 2010 and reporting in 2011. The review concluded that approximately 80% of care for older Australians is informal care provided by family, friends and neighbours. Around a million people received government-subsidised aged care services, most of these received low-level community care support, with 160,000 people in permanent residential care. Expenditure on aged care by all governments in 2009-10 was approximately $11 billion.[12]The need to increase the level of care, and known weaknesses in the care system (such as skilled workforce shortages and rationing of available care places), led several reviews in the 2000s to conclude that Australia's aged care system needs reform. This culminated in the 2011 Productivity Commission report and subsequent reform proposals.[13] In accordance with the Living Longer, Living Better amendments of 2013, assistance is provided in accordance with assessed care needs, with additional supplements available for people experiencing homelessness, dementia and veterans.[14]Australian Aged Care is often considered complicated due to various state and federal funding. Furthermore, there are many acronyms that customers need to be aware of, including ACAT, ACAR, NRCP, HACC, CACP, EACH, EACH-D and CDC (Consumer Directed Care) to name a few.[13]Private for-profit and not-for-profit facilities exist in Canada, but due to cost factors, some provinces operate or subsidize public facilities run by the provincial Ministry of Health. In public care homes, elderly Canadians may pay for their care on a sliding scale, based on annual income. The scale that they are charged on depends on whether they are considered for "Long Term Care" or "Assisted Living." For example, in January 2010, seniors living in British Columbia's government-subsidized "Long Term Care" (also called "Residential Care") started paying 80% of their after-tax income unless their after-tax income is less than $16,500. The "Assisted Living" tariff is calculated more simply as 70% of the after-tax income.[15] As seen in Ontario, there are waiting lists for many long-term care homes, so families may need to resort to hiring home healthcare or paying to stay in a private retirement home.[16]Care for the elderly in the UK has traditionally been funded by the state, but it is increasingly rationed, according to a joint report by the King's Fund and Nuffield Trust, as the cost of care to the nation rises.[17] People who have minimal savings or other assets are provided with care either in their own home (from visiting carers) or by moving to a residential care home or nursing home.[18] Larger numbers of old people need help because of an aging population and medical advances increasing life expectancy, but less is being paid out by the government to help them. A million people who need care get neither formal nor informal help.[19]A growing number of retirement communities, retirement villages or sheltered housing in the UK also offer an alternative to care homes but only for those with simple care needs. Extra Care housing provision can be suitable for older people with more complex needs. These models allow older people to live independently in a residential community or housing complex with other older people, helping to combat problems common amongst older people such as isolation.[20] In these communities, residents may access shared services, amenities, and access care services if required.[21]In general, retirement communities are privately owned and operated, representing a shift from a ‘care as service’ to ‘care as business’ model. Some commercially operated villages have come under scrutiny for a lack of transparency over exit fees or ‘event fees’.[22] It has been noted, however, that paying less now and more later may suit ‘an equity-rich, yet cash-poor, generation of British pensioners.’[20]Although most retirement village operators are run for profit, there are some charitable organisations in the space: for example, the ExtraCare Charitable Trust, which operates 14 retirement villages mostly in the Midlands, is a registered charity. Charities may derive additional funding from sources such as statutory agencies, charity appeals, legacies, and income from charity shops. Surplus funds are used to support residents' housing, health and well-being programmes, and for the development of new villages to meet growing national demand.[23]Extra Care housing usually involves provision of:According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the older population—persons 65 years or older—numbered 39.6 million in 2009.[25] They represented 12.9% of the U.S. population, about one in every eight Americans.[25] By 2030, there will be about 72.1 million older persons, more than twice their number in 2000.[25] People aged over 65 years represented 12.4% of the population in the year 2000, but that is expected to grow to be 19% of the population by 2030.[25] This means there will be more demand for elderly care [26] facilities in the coming years. There were more than 36,000 assisted living facilities in the United States in 2009, according to the Assisted Living Federation of America.[27] More than 1 million senior citizens are served by these assisted living facilities.[27]Last-year-of-life expenses represent 22% of all medical spending in the United States, 26% of all Medicare spending, 18% of all non-Medicare spending, and 25% of all Medicaid spending for the poor.[28]In the United States, most of the large multi-facility providers are publicly owned and managed as for-profit businesses.[10] However, there are exceptions, the largest operator in the US is the Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society, a not-for-profit organization that manages 6,531 beds in 22 states, according to a study by the American Health Care Association in 1995.[29]Given the choice, most older adults would prefer to continue to live in their homes (aging in place).[30] Many elderly people gradually lose functioning ability and require either additional assistance in the home or a move to an eldercare facility.[30] Their adult children often find it challenging to help their elderly parents make the right choices.[31] Assisted living is one option for the elderly who need assistance with everyday tasks. It costs less than nursing home care but is still considered expensive for most people.[32] Home care services may allow seniors to live in their own home for a longer period of time.One relatively new service in the United States that can help keep older people in their homes longer is respite care.[33] This type of care allows caregivers the opportunity to go on a vacation or a business trip and to know that their family member has good quality temporary care. Also, without this help the elder might have to move permanently to an outside facility. Another unique type of care cropping in U.S. hospitals is called acute care of elder units, or ACE units, which provide "a homelike setting" within a medical center specifically for older adults.[34]Information about long-term care options in the United States can be found by contacting the local Area Agency on Aging,[35] searching through ZIP code,[36] or elder referral agencies such as Silver Living or A Place for Mom. Furthermore, the U.S. government recommends evaluation of health care facilities through websites using data collected from sources such as Medicare records.[37]Population ageing is a challenge across the world, and China is no exception. Due to the one-child policy, rural/urban migration and other social changes, the traditional long-term care (LTC) for the elderly which was through direct family care in the past will no longer suffice. Barely existent now, both institutional and community-based services are expanding to meet the growing need. China is still at an earlier stage in economic development and will be challenged to build these services and train staff.[38]India's cultural view of elderly care is similar to that of Nepal. Parents are typically cared for by their children into old age, most commonly by their sons.[39] In these countries, elderly citizens, especially men, are viewed in very high regard. Traditional values demand honor and respect for older, wiser people.[40] Using data on health and living conditions from India's 60th National Sample Survey, a study found that almost a fourth of the elderly reported poor health. Reports of poor health were clustered among the poor, single, lower-educated, and economically inactive groups.[41]Under its eleventh Five-Year plan, the Indian government has made many strides similar to that of Nepal. Article 41 of the Indian Constitution states that elderly citizens will be guaranteed Social Security support for health care and welfare. A section of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code, alluding to its traditional background, mandates that children support their parents if they no longer can themselves.Due to health and economic benefits, the life expectancy in Nepal jumped from 27 years in 1951 to 65 in 2008.[42] Most elderly Nepali citizens, roughly 85%, live in rural areas.[42] Because of this, there is a significant lack of government sponsored programs or homes for the elderly. Traditionally, parents live with their children, and today, it is estimated that 90% of the elderly do live in the homes of their family.[42] This number is changing as more children leave home for work or school, leading to loneliness and mental problems in Nepali elderly.[42]The Ninth Five-Year Plan included policies in an attempt to care for the elderly left without children as caretakers.[42] A Senior Health Facilities Fund has been established in each district.[42] The Senior Citizens Health Facilities Program Implementation Guideline, 2061BS provides medical facilities to the elderly, and free medicines as well as health care to people who are poverty stricken in all districts.[42] In its yearly budget, the government has planned to fund free health care to all heart and kidney patients older than 75.[42] Unfortunately, many of these plans are overly ambitious, which has been recognized by the Nepali government.[42] Nepal is a developing nation and may not be able to fund all of these programs after the development of an Old Age Allowance (OAA). OAA provides a monthly stipend to all citizens over 70 years old and widows over 60 years old.[42]There are a handful of private day care facilities for elderly, but they are limited to the capital city. These day care services are very expensive and beyond the reach of general public.Thailand has observed global patterns of an enlarging elderly class: as fertility control is encouraged and medical advances are being made, the birth rate has diminished and people live longer.[5] The Thai government is noticing and concerned about this trend but tends to let families care for their elderly members rather than create extraneous policies for them.[43] As of 2011, there are only 25 state-sponsored homes for the elderly, with no more than a few thousand members of each home.[43] Such programs are largely run by volunteers and the services tend to be limited, considering there is not always a guarantee that care will be available. Private care is tough to follow, often based on assumptions. Because children are less likely to care for their parents, private caretakers are in demand.[43] Volunteer NGOs are available but in very limited quantities.[43]While there are certainly programs available for use by the elderly in Thailand, questions of equity have risen since their introduction.[44] The rich elderly in Thailand are much more likely to have access to care resources, while the poor elderly are more likely to actually use their acquired health care, as observed in a study by Bhumisuk Khananurak.[44] However, over 96% of the nation has health insurance with varying degrees of care available.[44]A distinction is generally made between medical and non-medical care, the latter not being provided by medical professionals and much less likely to be covered by insurance or public funds. In the US, 67% of the one million or so residents in assisted living facilities pay for care out of their own funds.[45] The rest get help from family and friends and from state agencies. Medicare does not pay unless skilled-nursing care is needed and given in certified skilled nursing facilities or by a skilled nursing agency in the home. Assisted living facilities usually do not meet Medicare's requirements. However, Medicare pays for some skilled care if the elderly person meets the requirements for the Medicare home health benefit.[46]Thirty-two U.S. states pay for care in assisted living facilities through their Medicaid waiver programs. Similarly, in the United Kingdom the National Health Service provides medical care for the elderly, as for all, free at the point of use, but social care is paid for by the state only in Scotland. England, Wales and Northern Ireland have failed to introduce any legislation on the matter and so social care is not funded by public authorities unless a person has exhausted their private resources, such as by selling the home. Money provided for supporting elderly people in the UK has fallen by 20% per person during the ten years from 2005 to 2015 and in real terms, the fall is even greater. L Experts claim that vulnerable UK people do not get what they need.[47]However, elderly care is focused on satisfying the expectations of two tiers of customers: the resident customer and the purchasing customer, who are often not identical, since relatives or public authorities, rather than the resident, may be providing the cost of care. If residents are confused or have communication difficulties, it may be very difficult for relatives or other concerned parties to be sure of the standard of care being given, and the possibility of elder abuse is a continuing source of concern. The Adult Protective Services Agency, a component of the human service agency in most states, is typically responsible for investigating reports of domestic elder abuse and providing families with help and guidance. Other professionals who may be able to help include doctors or nurses, police officers, lawyers, and social workers.[48]There is currently limited evidence to form a robust conclusion that involving older patients with multiple health conditions in decision-making during primary care consultations has benefits.[49] Examples of patient involvement in decision-making about their health care include patient workshops and coaching, individual patient coaching. Further research in this developing area is needed.Older adults are scared of losing their independence more than they fear death.[50] Promoting independence in self-care can provide older adults with the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them with a sense of achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers.[51] It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status of an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.[52]A study done by Langer and Rodin in 1976, investigated what the impacts could be if nursing home residents are given more responsibility in different daily activities, and more choices, compared if those responsibilities given to the nursing home staff. Residents in the nursing home were split into two different groups. One group of elderly residents was given more responsibility in their choices, and their day-to-day activities than the other group. This involved differences such as having the hospital administrator talked separately to the two groups. The group that was more responsibility induced was given a talk emphasizing their responsibility for themselves, while the talk given to the second group emphasized the responsibility of the nursing staff in taking care of the elderly residents. Another difference between the two groups is that both groups were given a plant. The group that was more responsibility induced was told they there were responsible for watering the plant each day while, the second group was told that the nursing staff was responsible for watering the plant. Results from this study indicated that the group that was more responsibility induced became more active, reported being happier, and increased alertness and they showed increased behavioral involvement in activities such as socializing, participation, and attendance in the nursing home activities such the nursing home's movie nights. They also showed higher health and mood which also declined more slowly than the previous group over time. It is also noted that these long-term benefits were most likely obtained because the treatment was not directed toward one single behavior or stimulus condition.[53]Elderly-friendly interior design plays a vital role in promoting independence among the elderly. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in smart homes provides a remote monitoring system to keep track of the daily activities of the elderly.[54] Thus adults can live on their own confidently knowing that a feedback alarm will be sent to their caregivers immediately in case of an emergency. This not only allows the aging population to maintain their independence and confidenc, but also brings peace of mind to their friends and family.Impaired mobility is a major health concern for older adults, affecting 50% of people over 85 and at least a fourth of those over 75 years old. As adults lose the ability to walko climb stairs, ano rise from a chair, they become completely disabled. The problem cannot be ignored because people over 65 years old constitute the fastest growing segment of the attendanceation.Therapy designed to improve mobility in elderly patients is usually built around diagnosing and treating specific impairments, such as reduced strength or poor balance. It is appropriate to compare older adults seeking to improve their mobility because athletes seeking to improve their split times. People in both groups perform best when they measure their progress and work toward specific goals related to strength, aerobic capacity, and other physical qualities. Someone attempting to improve an older adult's mobility must decide what impairments to focus on, and in many cases, there is little scientific evidence to justify any of the options. Today, many caregivers choose to focus on leg strength and balance. New research suggests that limb velocity and core strength may also be important factors in mobility.[55] Assistive technology and advancements in the health care field are further giving elders greater freedom and mobility. Several platforms now use artificial intelligence to suggest assistive devices to the elder for a better match. Well planned exercise programs can reduce the rate of falls in older people if they involve multiple categories such as balance, functional and resistance exercise.[56]Family members are one of the most important caregivers to the elderly, often comprising the majority and most commonly being a daughter or a granddaughter. Family and friends can provide a home (i.e. host elderly relatives), help with money and meet social needs by visiting, taking them out on trips, etc.One of the major causes of elderly falls is hyponatremia, an electrolyte disturbance when the level of sodium in a person's serum drops below 135 mEq/L. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the elderly patient population. Studies have shown that older patients are more prone to hyponatremia as a result of multiple factors including physiologic changes associated with aging such as decreases in glomerular filtration rate, a tendency for defective sodium conservation, and increased vasopressin activity. Mild hyponatremia ups the risk of fracture in elderly patients because hyponatremia has been shown to cause subtle neurologic impairment that affects gait and attention, similar to that of moderate alcohol intake.There are relatively few studies focusing on interventions to improve personal mobility of older adults living at home.[57][58]An elderly-friendly interior space can reduce mobility issues as well as other old-age issues. Staircase, lights, flooring etc can help elders combat mobility issues. Interior design can positively influence the physical and psychological wellness of the elderly, and if each area in house is designed for accommodation, it can let older adults live safely, comfortably and happily.While navigating floors, climbing stairs is one of the greatest challenges due to high risk of collapsing. A poorly designed staircase can negatively impact elders' psychology as they develop loss of confidence and fear of accidents. However, a staircase designed with the ergonomics and usage patterns of the elderly in mind, can make it easier for everyone. A stairlift can be a huge step to combat mobility issues.Appropriate lighting in the interior space makes it easier for elders to move around in the house. An average 60-year-old person requires three times more illuminance than an average 20-year-old boy.[citation needed][59] Windows, skylight and door openings can incorporate daylight into interior spaces. However, unplanned opening designs can lead to glare and increase the risk of falls and hinder their ability to perform daily tasks as the elderly are more sensitive to glare than young adults. Dual-layer curtains, drapes, window blinds, light shelves, low visual transmittance glazing or other shading systems can reduce glare. Illuminance can be increased by combining natural light with various kinds of artificial lights.When a person slips due to mobility issues, the flooring material plays a major role in the level of impact the person experiences after falling. Choosing the right flooring material in homes depending on whether an individual uses a walker, a wheelchair, or a cane, can also resolve many of the mobility issues faced by adults due to decline in physical strength, loss of balance. For elders, tile flooring is the least preferred option. Carpet, cork, sheet vinyl flooring are some of the flooring options which can be used for bedrooms, kitchen and bathrooms used by elders. Tiles can be extremely slippery when they are wet which increases the risk of accidents. Also, they are very hard and cold on feet which makes it difficult to walk barefoot during winters.Legal incapacity is an invasive and sometimes, difficult legal procedure. It requires that a person file a petition with the local courts, stating that the elderly person lacks the capacity to carry out activities that include making medical decisions, voting, making gifts, seeking public benefits, marrying, managing property and financial affairs, choosing where to live and who they socialize with. Most states' laws require two doctors or other health professionals to provide reports as evidence of such incompetence and the person to be represented by an attorney. Only then can the individual's legal rights be removed, and legal supervision by a guardian or conservator be initiated. The legal guardian or conservator is the person to whom the court delegates the responsibility of acting on the incapacitated person's behalf and must report regularly his or her activities to the court.A less restrictive alternative to legal incapacity is the use of "advance directives," powers of attorney, trusts, living wills and healthcare directives. The person who has such documents in place should have prepared them with their attorney when that person had capacity. Then, if the time comes that the person lacks capacity to carry out the tasks laid out in the documents, the person they named (their agent) can step in to make decisions on their behalf. The agent has a duty to act as that person would have done so and to act in their best interest. This article incorporates public domain material from A Profile of Older Americans: 2010.

Carlos Obligado;"Carlos Obligado (21 May 1889, in Buenos Aires – 3 February 1949, in Buenos Aires) was an Argentinian poet, crític and writer, best known for his patriotic lyrics to the song "Marcha de las Malvinas" (the Argentine name for the Falklands).He was the son of poet Rafael Obligado (the author of "Santos Vega") and Isabel Gómez Langenheim. He pursued studies at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and took his doctorate at the Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires in 1917.[1]His first book, "Poemas", was published in 1920. He translated several French poets (Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Alfred de Musset and others). He was a literary critic, lecturer and university professor and served as the director of the Instituto de Literatura Argentina. In 1928 he traveled to Europe, visiting several countries. On his return to Argentina, he was named a dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. He was later named a member of the Academia Argentina de Letras and the Real Academia Española. In 1932, he produced a comprehensive translation of the poems of Edgar Allan Poe and Percy Shelley as well as a critical study of Leopoldo Lugones. The Spanish government awarded him the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise in 1947.

Robert Bell (publisher);"Robert Bell (1732–1784) was a Scottish immigrant to the British colonies in America and became one of many early American printers and publishers active during the years leading up to and through the American Revolution. Bell became widely noted for printing Thomas Paine's celebrated work, Common Sense, a highly influential work during the revolution that openly criticized the British Parliament and their management and taxation of the British-American colonies. Bell and Paine later had a falling out over profits and publication issues.[1][2] As a dedicated patriot, Bell printed many pamphlets and books before and during the revolution, many of which "glowingly" expressed his patriotic views.[3] He also reprinted a number of popular English works, presenting them to the colonies for the first time. He ran an auction house which sold rare books in Lancaster, and in later life he toured the colonies selling off his massive book collection.[3][4] After Bell's death, his printing press and other items were sold at a Philadelphia auction house to another prominent printer at an unusually high price.[5][6]Robert Bell was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and was of the Quaker persuasion. Growing up in Scotland he was taught the book-binding trade. He traveled to Berwick-upon-Tweed, and continued in that trade for sometime. From there he moved to Dublin and became a bookseller, which at first seemed promising but after a few years the enterprise failed. He married in Dublin, and was for some time the partner of George Alexander Stevens, an English playwright and poet. Bell emigrated to the British colonies in 1767, and established himself as an auctioneer of books, where he soon became a full time bookseller in Philadelphia.[1][3]Bell arrived in Philadelphia from Dublin in 1767.[7][a] In 1769, or early in 1770, Bell established a printing press and shop in Philadelphia in a building which previously housed the Union Library, located next door to Saint Paul's Church, on Third street. He soon became known as an auctioneer of books, once referring to himself on record, 7 February 1774, as a "Professor of Book Auctioneering."[3] Unlike many other printers, Bell did not own or work for any newspaper, had no government contracts and had to rely on his own prospects.[9]Bell was the first to present a number of popular English works from a wide selection in every class of literaturecurrent in England in simple affordable printing and binding. His successful practice of offering inexpensive editions soon compelled other printers to offer publications where the common citizen could thereby obtain works of literature they would otherwise be unable to afford. Bell biographer David Landis maintained in his 1908 essay that such a sales practice put Bell as a publisher way ahead of his time.[4][3]As a book seller one of Bell's earliest advertisements appeared in the  14 April 1768, issue of Benjamin Franklin's Pennsylvania Gazette. In July he advertised his first publications in the Pennsylvania Chronicle "which introduced to the people of this continent the first American edition of two works of those duo immortals and staunch friends": The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia, written by  Doctor Samuel Johnson in 1763, and The Traveller, written by Oliver Goldsmith in 1764:[3][7] In 1772, Bell published Blackstone's Commentaries in four volumes, which saw a good subscription rate in Philadelphia. Prior to this he published William Robertson's biography of  Emperor Charles the Fifth. These two works are considered Bell's first successful publications while in Philadelphia.[1][10] He also published  Sterne's Sentimental Journey, Robertson's History of Scotland in three volumes, Leland's History of Ireland in four volumes, Robinson Crusoe, Paradise Lost, along with, plays, poems, and novels innumerable.[4]There was a paper shortage in the American colonies in the several years leading up to the Revolutionary War, and grew more serious during that war as the demand for paper increased. Before 1765 most of the paper used by colonial printers and newspapers was imported, while the struggling colonial paper mills, mostly located in Pennsylvania, were not able to meet the demands of the many printers that emerged during the war.[11] Bell worked with the public in an effort to collect rags used in the production of paper. Along with other printers, Bell printed advertisements in various Pennsylvania newspapers for the call and collection of rags used in paper manufacturing, along with essays on paper making and the materials used for its production. This was yet another effort that would bring the colonies together in a common cause.[12][13]In the years leading up to and through the American Revolution, Bell printed many pamphlets and books which ardently expressed his patriotic ideas and sentiments. As a printer in Philadelphia[b] he worked tirelessly in that effort more than most printers. By 1776 he was especially busy when he printed a continuation of letters to the Legislature on American Independence. A second edition of "Plain Truth" was partly printed on coarse blue paper, which, as Bell stated, "constituted the law of necessity," and he added, further, "The Patriot surmounteth every difficulty," etc.[3]Bell was commissioned by Thomas Paine to print his work, Common Sense, which has been widely considered the most inciteful and influential work of the revolutionary era,[15][16][17][c] as it advocated American independence, now ripe in the minds of colonists, and openly criticized the British Crown and Parliamentary rule over the colonies.[14][19] Paine originally had intended for his work to be printed in the various colonial newspapers in a series of articles, but they were concerned that British colonial authorities very likely would threaten or confiscate their printing operations.[d]  On the recommendation of Benjamin Rush, who thought highly of Bell, referring to him as the "Republican printer", and thought him courageous enough to print what became a politically volatile work,[21][22][e] Paine complied and turned over his manuscript to Bell. Paine made an agreement with him that if the publication should prove to be an unprofitable venture that he would cover any losses he incurred. To further make the prospect attractive, Paine agreed to give Bell half of any profits realized. The other half Paine intended to purchase wool mittens for the troops going to Quebec, giving a written order on Bell to two officers of the Continental Army. Bell at once set to printing the work with great enthusiasm, feeling just as strongly about the idea of independence as Paine. Bell set the price of the pamphlet at two shillings per copy.[23][f] For fear of recrimination, Paine had the first edition of Common Sense published anonymously.[14] At the time of its printing there was a serious paper shortage in the colonies, compounded by the revolution.[25] Bell placed an advertisement in the 10 January 1776, issue of William Bradford's newspaper,  The Pennsylvania Journal, following with one in The Pennsylvania Evening Post on 27 January, owned by Benjamin Towne. Common Sense was favorably received throughout the colonies and sold very quickly.[26][25]Paine's work received some criticism, most notably in a pamphlet by James Chalmers, writing under the assumed name of Candidus[g]  entitled The Plain Truth, also printed by Bell, which was not received well by a patriotic populace who drove Chalmers into exile.[14] Bell also received heavy criticism for publishing Chalmers' work from patriots who assumed Bell was lending Chalmers support for appearing to oppose independence and the ideas set forth in Paine's work. In his own defense, in reference to Plain Truth, Bell inserted in another publication a vindication of the liberty of the press which he described as "Extracted from an Old Pamphlet, Published in the Year 1756, Entitled Plain Truth." The author of this "Old Pamphlet", like that of Chalmers named Plain Truth, was Benjamin Franklin. Bell used the words of Franklin, who, like Bell, was a strong proponent of independence and freedom of the press, in vindication of a pamphlet against these ideals.[27]Bell and Paine fell into disagreement about payment and publishing terms over Common Sense which began three weeks after the first advertisement of Paine's work appeared in the Pennsylvania Journal. Bell had claimed that he had not made any profit printing and publishing Common Sense and proceeded to publish an unauthorized edition. The disagreement grew into a controversy between the two which was covered in the local newspapers. Bell's second advertisement in the Evening Post included an attack on Paine's work, while Paine was still an anonymous figure. Paine responded by taking his business to Bell's competitor, the Bradford brothers, William and Thomas, who printed a third edition that included Paine's name on the cover, with a note appended declaring that Bell's second edition was unauthorized.[29] The third edition became the standard text which became widely known to this day. It also contained an appendix, in which Paine included an “Epistle to the Quakers”. During the course of the sordid affair the attacks on the work and each other's character continued, mostly by Bell.[14][30][31]In 1776, Bell, James Humphreys and Robert Aitken together  reprinted and published The Military Guide for Young Officers, a military, historical, and definitive dictionary which included passages from essays on the recruiting, arming, supplying, training and discipline of British infantry and cavalry.[32]After the Revolutionary War  Bell became an acclaimed book auctioneer whose name was recognized from Virginia to New Hampshire. As an auctioneer he sold most of his books, which he referred to as his "jewels and diamonds", in New York, Boston, Baltimore, Norfolk, among other towns.[1] While on a book-selling trip to Richmond, Virginia, Bell became ill and died there on 16 or 23 September 1784, the accounts vary on the exact date.[3]Shortly after Bell's death, the contents of his shop, which included a printing press, office furniture, tools and books, were put up for auction. His books and other items sold for a few dollars, while the bidding for his printing press started with Mathew Carey for the modest amount of ten dollars. After fierce back and forth bidding between Carey and Colonel Eleazer Oswald, the editor of the Independent Gazette, Bell's press was finally awarded to Carey for one hundred and fifty dollars, the average price for a new press.[5][6]"

Lil Milagro Ramírez;"Lil Milagro de la Esperanza Ramírez Huezo Córdoba (San Salvador, April 3, 1946 – Ibid., October 17, 1979) was a Salvadoran poet and revolutionary leader, a founding member of the first guerrilla organizations that would come together in 1980 to form the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). She was captured by agents of the National Guard in November, 1976.[1] Her detention was kept secret and from that moment on she was considered "disappeared" until she was murdered inside the clandestine jails of the National Guard on October 17, 1979, after being tortured for three years. She is now remembered for her courage and determination in favor of the unprivileged lower classes.[2]Lil Milagro de la Esperanza Ramírez Huezo Córdoba was born in San Salvador on April 3, 1946 to philosopher and professor Tránsito Huezo Córdoba de Ramírez and José Ramírez Ávalos, who had three more children together: Luz América, Amada, and José Napoleón. Lil entered the University of El Salvador (UES) to pursue a doctorate in Case law and Social science in 1963. Despite having finished the program, Lil decided not to graduate as a form of protest against a political system that she considered unjust and oppressive, and which she had no desire to serve.[3]Lil Milagro started as head of the Juventud Demócrata Cristiana in 1966. Her early years in politics were marked ideologically by Christian socialism, though later on she was heavily influenced by Marxism. In 1970, after finishing her studies at UES, Lil decided to leave her home in San Jacinto, where she lived with her parents, and began her life in clandestinity. In 1971, she appears as part of a small movement called simply "El Grupo," which formed the core of the organization that in March 1972 would become the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), in the midst of a turbulent electoral process.[4]In 1975, Lil Milagro, together with Costa Rican Eduardo Sancho (a.k.a. Fermán Cienfuegos) and other fellow guerrilla fighters, decides to abandon the ERP and found a new political movement called Resistencia Nacional (RN). This separation was due to several ideologically-motivated clashes within the ERP that resulted in the execution of the revolutionary leader and poet Roque Dalton and Armando Arteaga, both in the hands of the ERP's high command. Lil and Roque had maintained a romantic relationship that ended abruptly in with Dalton's death.An early morning in November 1976, Lil Milagro is captured by members of the now-extinct Guardia Nacional (GN) during a search of the house where she had been staying in San Antonio del Monte, Sonsonate. Professor Manuel Rivera, member of the executive council of the National Salvadoran Association of Educators (ANDES 21 de junio), is also captured and killed, receiving two bullets, Lil, on the other hand, gets shot in the head but survives. Unconscious, she was dragged by her captors as if she were dead, which prompted eye-witnesses to the event to declare her deceased the day after. She was taken to facilities of the Customs Police, where she was tortured using Truth serum. In late-December, 1976, Lil Milagro is transferred to the secret prisons of the National Guard, where she would again be tortured. She remained in these prisons, living under extreme, inhumane conditions,[5] until she was murdered on October 17, 1979, two days after the coup d'état that overthrew President Carlos Humberto Romero and placed the Junta Revolucionaria de Gobierno in power. Her remains were never given back to her family.[6][7]Lil Milagro de la Esperanza Ramírez Huezo Córdoba is one of the many martyrs left by the violent Salvadoran Civil War, which ended with the Chapultepec Peace Accords signed on January 16, 1992, more than 12 years after her death. Several organizations have taken Lil's name, e.g. the Women's Association for Democracy "Lil Milagro Ramírez" and the Women's Rights Commission "Lil Milagro Ramírez" (CEMUJER), among others.[8][9]Her love for literature was recorded in the many poems she wrote, including some for children. A collection of poems by Lil Milagro was published in 2003 by the Literature Department of the University of El Salvador (UES), titled “Del Hombre, del tiempo y del amor.” A biographical book is currently being prepared, which will include newly-discovered documents such as letters about her militancy, correspondence while living in clandestinity, photographs, etc."

He was the ancestor of the Barnewall Baronets of Crickstown.He was born at Crickstown, County Meath, the eldest son of Sir Christopher Bernevall (died 1446) and his wife Matilda (or Maud) Drake (died before 1424), an heiress of the wealthy Drake family of Drakerath. She was a close relative, possibly a sister, of John Drake, who was three times Lord Mayor of Dublin in the early 1400s, and led the citizens of Dublin to a decisive victory over the O'Byrne clan of County Wicklow at the Battle of Bloody Bank on the River Dargle in 1402.Nicholas's father was Lord Chief Justice of Ireland for more than a decade. Nicholas was "bred up to the law", and was appointed to the same office as his father in 1457, with a knighthood. In 1461 he was superseded in favour of Sir Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket, but regained office later the same year. He retired about 1463, and was still alive in 1465.He married Ismay, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Robert Serjeant of Castleknock, County Dublin: they had at least two sons, Christopher and Edmund. Ismay's sister Joan married Sir Jenico d'Artois the younger, eldest son of the soldier and statesman Sir Jenico d'Artois and his first wife Joan Taaffe of Liscarton Castle, County Meath. There was a bitter dispute over the family inheritance between the two sisters and their respective husbands, from which the Barnewalls emerged the winners, acquiring far more than the half share of the estate to which Ismay was entitled by law.Christopher, Nicholas's eldest son, inherited Crickstown, where the Barnewall family remained for several generations. He married Ellen Butler, daughter of Edmund Butler, 8th Baron Dunboyne. In 1623 his descendant Sir Patrick Barnewall was conferred with a baronetcy in 1623, which still exists.Ismay outlived her husband, and remarried the prominent Yorkist nobleman Sir Robert Bold, 1st and last Baron Ratoath, who died in 1479.

Science is a Sacred Cow;"Science is a Sacred Cow is a book written by the chemist Anthony Standen. It was first published in 1950 by E. P. Dutton. It was in print for 40 years.[1] The book argues that some scientists and many teachers of science have "inflated egos"[1] or, in the words of Standen, "a fabulous collective ego, as inflated as a skillfully blown piece of bubble gum".[2] The book was widely reviewed.[3]Part of the book's thesis is that the general public and students of science hold the words of scientists in awe even when these are merely "latinized nonsense".[1] According to a March 1950 issue of Time, Standen's concerns are that scientists can be and have been "overbearing," "overpraised," and "overindulged".[4] The book was once praised by one of the great scientists: Albert Einstein.[1] An editorial note in the March 27, 1950, issue of Life magazine introducing several pages[5] of excerpts and a half dozen editorial cartoons from Sacred Cow states "With tongue-in-cheek hyperbole, [Standen] suggests that a group that takes itself so seriously deserves some serious skepticism. Life—without taking all Mr. Standen's funmaking too seriously—thinks he deserves a happy hearing".[6]The book is 221 pages and has eight chapters: "
Nettleden;"Nettleden is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Nettleden with Potten End, in the  Dacorum district, in the county of Hertfordshire, England. It is in the Chiltern Hills, about four miles north-west of Hemel Hempstead, near Little Gaddesden, Great Gaddesden and Frithsden. In 1931 the parish had a population of 133.[1]The village name of Nettleden is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means 'valley where nettles grow'.[2] In manorial records of the late twelfth century the village was recorded as Neteleydene.Historically, Nettleden was a hamlet in the parish of Pitstone in Buckinghamshire, although the boundary of the hamlet was almost surrounded by the county of Hertfordshire. Nettleden was included in the Berkhamsted Poor Law Union from 1835.[3] As Nettleden had its own overseer of the poor, it was deemed to be a separate civil parish from 10 August 1866 under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866. When district councils were established in December 1894, Nettleden was included in the Berkhamsted Rural District, which was temporarily allowed to straddle Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire pending Nettleden being transferred to Hertfordshire, which happened on 30 September 1895.[4]The church, St Lawrence, was first mentioned in 1285 when it became a part of the endowment of Ashridge Monastery. The church, except for the tower, was largely rebuilt in brick by John, Earl of Bridgewater, in 1811. Until 1895 it was a chapelry of Pitstone.The hamlet of St Margaret's, formerly belonging to Ivinghoe in Buckinghamshire, was added to the parish of Nettleden in 1895 at the same time as the county boundary change. Here, Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester, founded the nunnery of St Margaret's de Bosco. After the Dissolution in 1539, St Margaret's came into private hands. During the Second World War, St Margaret's Camp was a London County Council senior school for evacuee boys from London. The school closed one week after the end of the war in Europe, when all the boys were returned to their homes in London. Since 1984 it has been the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery.On 1 April 1937 the civil parish of Nettleden was abolished, joining with parts of the parishes of Great Berkhampstead Rural and Northchurch to form a new parish called Nettleden with Potten End.[4]From Nettleden to Frithsden runs the Roman Road or Spooky Lane, named in reference to the ghost of an Ashridge monk. In the early 19th century, the lane was dug deeper into the hill, with high revetted walls on both sides, and a bridge was built over the lane, in order that people using the driveway leading to Ashridge did not meet the villagers. Another feature of Nettleden is the steep Pipers Hill to the east of the village."
The Diamond Mine (short story);""The Diamond Mine" is a short story by Willa Cather. It was first published in McClure's in October 1916.[1]Aboard a ship, Cressida Garnet, a soprano, meets a cousin of her late first husband's. She tells him of her love affair with Blasius Bouchalka, a Bohemian violinist who was her second husband. After he had an affair with their maid, Ruzenka, she filed for divorce and never saw him again. She is now set to marry Jerome Brown, a financier. Later, we learn that Cressida died on the RMS Titanic. Her marriage to Jerome Brown is said to have been an unhappy one, as he constantly demanded more money from her. Similarly, we learn that after her death, her family wrangled over her will, each hoping to cash in on her fortune.The story was the last one she published in McClure's.[2] Moreover, it has been noted that Cather initially didn't think the story would suit the format of a magazine due to its length, subject matter and mode of narration.[2]It has been suggested that The Diamond Mine bears similarities with The Song of the Lark, insofar as both writings deal with a female artist's relationship with her family.[3]"

The museum has its head office in Kristiansund and is organized as a foundation. Its office is located at Storgata 19.[1]The museum currently has branches in all of the municipalities in Nordmøre:[2] two departments in Smøla (the Smøla museum and Norwegian Marsh Museum), in Averøy and Eide (the Old Kvernes Rural Museum), Tingvoll, Surnadal (the Åsen Village Museum, Kleiva Poet's Home, and Svinvik Arboretum), Rindal, Aure (the Kråksund Fishing Museum), Halsa (a museum dedicated to the traditional geitbåt 'goat boat' and the Husasnotra boat-building area), and Sunndal (the Sunndal Museum in the Leikvin Heritage Park). The museum has a cooperation agreement with the municipality of Gjemnes. The head of the museum is Ståle Tangen.The museum was established as the Kristiansund Museum in 1894, and from the beginning the main building was an exhibition pavilion from the large-scale fishing exhibition held in 1892. Together with the museum's founder, Anders Sandvig, the committed young museologist Wilhelm Lund laid plans in Lillehammer for a major open-air cultural museum in Kristiansund. The Almskår farmhouse, one of the last authentic open-hearth farmhouses from Nordmøre, was moved to Kristiansund. The museum also acquired a raised granary before it was realized that the weather in Kristiansund was not suited to a regular open-air museum with transferred buildings.The Kristiansund Museum was badly damaged when the city with its old wooden houses was bombed by German aircraft in April 1940. The museum lost most of its collection when the pavilion burned down.In the 1960s, the small open-air museum was moved to Dalen Farm on the outskirts of the city, which was regarded as preservation-worthy. In 1965 the museum opened a new fireproof brick building at the Knudtzondal Farm on the city's outskirts. In 1980, the museum focused on heritage conservation at the harbor in Kristiansund, where the museum is represented by the Norwegian Dried Cod Museum and Mellem Shipyard, where historical sailing ships are also restored.[1]Coordinates: 63°06′33″N 7°43′52″E﻿ / ﻿63.10911°N 7.73110°E﻿ / 63.10911, 7.73110"

She stayed 3 seasons in Germany and scored 30 league goals in 63 league appearances.[3]She returned to the Netherlands ahead of the 2007–08 season and played for ADO Den Haag in the inaugural women's Eredivisie.[1] Until that point in her career, Bito played as a forward but at ADO she began playing as a right-back.[4] She also made her debut in the UEFA Women's Cup (now known as UEFA Women's Champions League) during the 2007–08 UEFA Women's Cup first qualifying round match against KÍ of the Faroe Islands.[5]In 2008, she signed with AZ Alkmaar and won the Eredivisie titles in 2008–09[6] and 2009–10.[7] Bito won the KNVB Women's Cup in 2010–11, she played in the final where AZ defeated SC Heerenveen by 2–0.[8]When AZ decided to stop its women's football activities after the conclusion of the 2010–11 season,[9] Bito was amongst the many players who moved to newly created club Telstar.[10] She played in the BeNe League, when it replaced the Eredivisie in 2012. After four seasons at the club, Bito announced her retirement from football in 2015.[11][12]For 15 years, Bito was a member of the Dutch national team. Her debut came against Hungary on 14 October 2000, she came on as a substitute in the 75th minute of a qualification match for the UEFA Women's Euro 2001 play-off which the Netherlands won 3–0.[1][5][13][14]She was part of the Dutch squad which played the UEFA Women's Euro 2009 in Finland.[12] In December 2009, then national coach Vera Pauw left Bito and Claudia van den Heiligenberg out of the squad ahead of a match against Belarus. The decision proved controversial and it was reported that the duo were kicked out because they were in a relationship.[15] Pauw angrily dismissed the claims, saying it was an insult to suggest they were excluded because of their relationship.[16] Van den Heiligenberg and Bito remained together[17] and both were restored to the national team by incoming national coach Roger Reijners in 2010.On 22 April 2010, Bito made her 100th appearance for the Dutch national team at a 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification match against Macedonia.[1]In June 2013 national team coach Roger Reijners selected Bito in the squad for UEFA Women's Euro 2013 in Sweden.[18]Reijners selected Bito as part of the Dutch squad for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada.[19] Shortly after the conclusion of the tournament, she announced her retirement from football and by that time, she was the second most capped Dutch international player with 146 appearances (behind only Annemieke Kiesel's 156).[12]"

Battle of Sacramento (Kentucky);"The Battle of Sacramento was an engagement of the American Civil War that took place in Sacramento, Kentucky on December 28, 1861. Confederate cavalry under Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest, numbering between 200 and 300, attacked, encircled and defeated a Union force of 500 under Major Eli H. Murray which had been watering south of the town after moving across the bank of the Green River. Though exact casualty information is disputed, with differing accounts from each side, several eyewitnesses attested to the personal courage of Forrest, and the Confederate commander was praised by his superiors for his bravery.The engagement was one of the earliest of Forrest's career as a commander of the cavalry, and it featured several examples of tactics and traits which would become hallmarks of his military career, including the division of his forces, outflanking and encirclement, concealment, and personally leading cavalry charges. It was also an early battle for Brigadier-General Stovepipe Johnson, who was then a private. The Union force was decisively routed, and the battle became known as "Forrest's First Fight" and is annually re-enacted by local residents.Both the Union Army and the Confederate forces recruited and drilled within Kentucky, as the state's population "displayed divided loyalties" during the early stages of the Civil War.[4] Confederate Major-General Leonidas Polk began taking Kentucky villages in September 1861 with the blessing of Jefferson Davis, despite the protests of Confederate commanders Simon Bolivar Buckner and Leroy Walker. Union Brigadier-General Ulysses S. Grant approached using the Ohio River and stationed himself at Paducah, arriving to face newly appointed Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston.[4] By October, with both armies maneuvering in an attempt to gain the upper hand, Forrest's battalion was ordered to Kentucky from Memphis, Tennessee, reporting to Colonel Adolphus Heiman. Heiman was charged with constructing Fort Henry and Fort Donelson and had requested a unit of cavalry to support him.[4]Forrest had with him eight companies recruited from Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas. Drilled for close combat, the majority of the force was armed with shotguns.[4] He quickly established himself in the region, laying an ambush for a Union gunboat on November 20 and forcing it back.[4] He continued to skirmish with gunboats for the remainder of the month, captured a Union supply center on November 24 - narrowly avoiding a sniper's bullet that instead took the life of his surgeon - and received reinforcements of two new companies from Huntsville, Alabama.[4]On the morning of the battle, Forrest and his cavalry corps were approaching Sacramento when they were informed by a sympathizer named Mollie Morehead that the Union force led by Eli H. Murray was watering their horses nearby.[2] Forrest, who had been wintering in camp near Hopkinsville with his family since Christmas, had already taken scouting reports that morning which stated that the enemy force had been nearby moving along the banks of the Green River, and was keen to attack.[2] Despite cold weather and light rain, Forrest led his forces in pursuit. Morehead rode alongside Forrest, and the latter would later remark that "her untied tresses, floating in the breeze, infused into my arm and kindled knightly chivalry in my heart."[2]Major MurrayColonel ForrestForrest led two hundred cavalry troopers divided into three groups: one dismounted to attack from the front while concealed by bushes and fences, while two - one of thirty men and one of sixty - remained mounted to outflank the Union forces, which were five hundred strong.[1][2] The Union forces were at first unsure as to the identity of the arriving troops, however they returned fire once Forrest had fired the opening shot himself.[2] He then led the cavalry charge personally, signaled it with a cry to the bugler of "blow the charge, Isham."[2] The outflanking forces then became embroiled in hand-to-hand combat with the now fleeing Union troops.[2]Led by this impetuous chieftain, we swooped down upon our foes with such terrific yells and sturdy blows as might have them believe a whole army was on them, and turning tail, they fled in the wildest terror, a panic-stricken mass of men and horses... cutting and shooting right and left, and Forrest himself in his fury ignoring all command and always in the thickest of the melee.An eyewitness account by Confederate Private James Hammer noted that Forrest personally killed nine enemy soldiers, despite having his horse shot out from under him.[2] Many of Forrest's officers, who had not seen him fight before, were surprised by his aggression that replaced his "usually mild" demeanour.[2] Union and Confederate sources disagree on the number of casualties, with Union accounts recording the deaths of two officers and eight men, with thirteen prisoners. Confederate sources state that "closer to a hundred" were killed, and thirty-five captured.[1][2] Forrest himself suffered a dislocated shoulder after being dismounted by a collision with two riderless horses.[2]So fierce did his passion become that he was almost equally dangerous to friend or foe, and, as it seemed to some of us, he was too wildly excitable to be capable of judicious command. Later we became aware that excitement neither paralyzed nor mislead his magnificent military genius.The battle was Forrest's first combat victory,[1][5] and during it he demonstrated several tactics for which he would later become known:[1] in particular, the division of his forces into groups, employment of deception and encirclement, and leading the cavalry charge personally.[2] The battle is often nicknamed "Forrest's First Fight",[6] and his superior at the time, Brigadier-General Charles Clark, took note of his "skill, energy and courage."[2] Clark wrote to his government that "I am assured by officers and men that throughout the entire engagement he was conspicuous for the most daring courage, always in advance of his command. He was at one time engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict with 4 of the enemy, 3 of whom he killed, dismounting and making a prisoner of the fourth."[2] The battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998,[3] and the battle is annually re-enacted by local residents.[6]"

Marsha Garces Williams;"Marsha Garces Williams[3][4] (born June 18, 1956) is an American film producer and philanthropist.[2][3][5] She was married to actor and comedian Robin Williams from 1989 to 2010.[2][5]Marsha Lynn Garces was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She grew up in Shorewood, Wisconsin, and attended Shorewood High School.[6] Garces' father, Leon Garces, was Filipino and born in Ubay, Bohol, who moved to the United States in 1929.[7][8] He later served in the United States Navy during World War II.[7][9] Her mother, Ina Rachel Mattila,[7] was Finnish.[8][10][11]Garces married Robin Williams on April 30, 1989, following the 1988 divorce from his first wife, Valerie. Garces became pregnant with Williams' child late in 1988, and the pair were later married on April 30, 1989. Garces met Williams in 1984 when she was employed as a nanny for Williams's son Zachary. Previously, Garces was a painter working as a waitress.[12][13] According to his first wife, the romantic relationship between Robin and Marsha began after they separated.[5] During their marriage, they had two children, Zelda Rae and Cody Alan, born in 1989 and 1991, respectively.[13] In March 2008, she filed for divorce from Williams citing irreconcilable differences.[2] Their divorce was finalized in 2010.[14]After working as the family's nanny, Garces worked with Williams as his personal assistant on films such as Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Dead Poets Society (1989).[5][9][12] She was later the producer for several of Williams's films.[2][5][11] Together, they founded a film production company, Blue Wolf Productions, in 1991.[2] Garces Williams has been involved philanthropically with organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and Seacology.[2][5]"
Kluckhohn;"Kluckhohn is a surname. Notable people with the surname include:"
Osphronemus;"Osphronemus is a genus of large gouramis, the only genus within the subfamily Osphroneminae.  These fish are known as the giant gouramis and are native to rivers, lakes, pools, swamps and floodplains in Southeast Asia, with O. exodon from the Mekong basin, O. laticlavius and O. septemfasciatus from Borneo, while O. goramy is relatively widespread.[1][2][3] O. goramy has been introduced outside its native range in Asia, Africa and Australia.[4]All the species are highly prized as food fish, leading to farming of O. goramy and rearing of O. septemfasciatus.[5] Osphronemus appear in the aquarium trade, but they are very long-lived, possibly reaching up to 40 years old,[5] and require a very large tank with a strong filter.[6]As suggested by their English name, they are by far the largest gouramis, reaching 50–70 cm (20–28 in) in standard length depending on the exact species involved.[1] Possibly the largest recorded specimen, an O. septemfasciatus caught in Sarawak, was c. 72.5 cm (28.5 in) in standard length and weighed 20.5 kg (45 lb).[5] Although the species are overall similar, they do differ in details of their pattern and colour, with some species having black or red sections or markings.[2][3]Breeding has been described in detail for O. goramy: the male builds a bubble nest with plant material at the water's surface.[7][8] The pair spawns nearby and the eggs are moved to the nest by the male, who guards them by himself. He continues to guard the young for a few weeks after they hatch from the eggs.[8] A rather similar breeding behavior has been reported for O. exodon, although in this species the nest is placed at the bottom of a 0.5–1 m (1.6–3.3 ft) deep pool, the female reportedly lives inside it for more than a month, while the male stays outside and guards it.[9]Like other gouramis, the members of the genus Osphronemus are able to breathe by gulping air from the water's surface. Compared to other gouramis, their suprabranchial organ is highly elaborate, leading to speculations that they also may be able to detect smells in the air. This might help them to find the land vegetation that they feed on.[4] They feed mostly on fruits, seeds, leaves, flowers, bark and roots from land plants, macrophytes and algae, but will also take small animals like insects, worms, crustaceans, fish and amphibians.[6][7][8][9][10] Unlike the other species, adult O. exodon have quite conspicuous teeth on the outside of their lips.[3] This species often occurs in flooded forests,[11] and it will jump out of the water to pick fruits from overhanging branches.[12] Its unusual teeth may also be useful when feeding on roots and when building its nest.[9]There are currently four recognized species in this genus:[1]"
Maindample;"Maindample is a town in north east Victoria (Australia). It is located in the Mansfield Shire local government area, 174 kilometres (108 mi) north east of the state capital Melbourne. South, just outside the town, are twin hills known as The Paps. The Aboriginal name for these is Maindample.[2]The Maroondah Highway passes near the town on route to the lower alpine region of Victoria.The area was a hunting and gathering ground for the Taungurung people.Maindample was part of a 140,000 acre pastoral run taken up by overlanders and squattors James Watson and Alexander Hunter in 1840 acting as agents for a group of Scottish aristocrat investors.[3][4][5] Watson and Hunter ran into financial difficulties in the economic depression that began in 1840 and were insolvent by March 1843.[6]The property was divided into four separate properties of which Maindample was one. When offered for sale in November 1846, Maindample station consisted of 27,000 acres, 3 huts and was stocked with “4,759 sheep (more or less) ... eight working bullocks, a dray, one horse and a “Rob Roy” saddle and bridle.” The new owners, taking possession in January 1847, were William Highett and Thomas Willis.[7] Highett was the sole licensee by March 1853 and this continued till June 1866.[8]The Parish of Maindample had been proclaimed by December 1860. An early resident of the area was Andrew Crockett JP.Gold was discovered in 1867 and Maindample Reefs had a scattered population of 200 by September that year.[9] There were 600 residents by February 1868. Two quartz crushing mills were built near the creek and a post office was established in April 1868. A police station was also established that year. At its peak as a mining town, Maindample had a population of almost 1,000.[10] There was a school, several general stores and about twenty pubs and hotels.[11] Kelson’s Royal Hotel offered “first-class restaurant meals at all hours,” and had a Cobb and Co booking office.[12] Other pubs included Powel’s Reefer’s Hotel, the Pig and Whistle, the Royal Hotel and Mac’s Hotel. The latter was destroyed by fire in 1894, rebuilt, and burned down again in 1904.[13][14] The Bridge Inn Hotel was built in 1876.The bushranger Harry Power was active in the area after escaping from prison in 1869. It was reported in the press at the time that, “He visited Maindample and spoke very contemptuously of the place as not being worth the trouble of sticking up.”[15]There was a blacksmith by 1872, located next to Mac’s Hotel. The site for a township was surveyed in 1875.[16] There was a butchers and a small bakers store by 1899. And near the railway station there was a sawmill (1903-1913). There was also some dairying in the area.[17] A progress association was formed in 1899. It lapsed and was reestablished in 2007.[18]Important pastoral properties established in the area in the nineteenth century include Wappan Station, Maindample Park and Barjarg Station.[19]Tenders were called in 1888 for the construction of a railway line from Cathkin to Mansfield. The rail line was to have eight stations including one at Maindample.[20] The line had reached Maindample by January 1891.[21]The first meeting of the Maindample Racing Club was held at Mansfield in fine weather in front of a large crowd in May 1891.[22] The club continued till the 1964-65 racing season after which it was amalgamated with the Mansfield Racing Club.[23]A public hall was built in 1916.[24] It was used to host concerts, balls, dances and meetings. For instance, in October 1944 a meeting was held to form the Maindample Bush Fire Brigade (Maindample Rural Fire Brigade).The decline in mining saw residents depart in search of employment elsewhere. By 1899, the town consisted of only about 10 houses, a general store and two pubs.[25] The population had fallen to 75 by 1903. The Tallarook-Mansfield railway ceased to operate in 1978 and it is now a rail trail. The post office closed in 1989.In October 1973, a Nomad prototype aircraft crash-landed on a roadway near the Bridge Inn Hotel.[26] None of the four people aboard was injured.[27]The state primary school was pulled down and rebuilt in 1916. It closed in 1948 but a Rudolph Steiner School was established in the town in 1986.[28]The Bridge Inn Hotel, a popular stop over for travellers to the Victorian ski fields, burned down in 2010.[29]Modest growth saw the population increase to 212 by the 2016 census.Businesses in or near modern Maindample include a plant nursery and a helicopter hire firm."
Alex Webster;"Alex Webster (born 1969) is an American bass player, who is best known as a member of the death metal band Cannibal Corpse. He is one of two remaining members of the original lineup of the band, along with drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz. He is also the bassist for the band Blotted Science and the supergroup Conquering Dystopia. Before Cannibal Corpse was formed, he was part of Beyond Death.Webster was born in Akron, New York. When describing his relationship with music, he has stated "I just always liked music since I was a little kid. Music was always a soundtrack in my head to things going on in my life. I always wanted to play. I wanted to play drums when I was about three. I made a drum out of an old butter container and hit it with tinker toys. I was going to make music. Most people who are musicians didn't have to have anyone tell them to do it. I would never push music on someone, because it is something that doesn't need to be pushed. If you're going to make music, you're going to make it."[1]Webster was originally of the band Beyond Death, with ex-Cannibal Corpse guitarist Jack Owen, back in 1987. Both met up with Chris Barnes, Bob Rusay and Paul Mazurkiewicz, all of whom were in the band Tirant Sin. Webster was the one to come up with the band's name, Cannibal Corpse. In an interview he said that he thought it was a very catchy name for a band. He has a reputation for being friendly to his fans, often asking questions, and genuinely caring what his fans think, regularly answering questions on the band's forum.[2] Webster also recorded bass for Hate Eternal, Erik Rutan's death metal band. Rutan is the producer for Cannibal Corpse's albums that were released between 2006 and 2012, Kill, Evisceration Plague, and Torture. In 2005, Alex was contacted by guitarist Ron Jarzombek about a possible collaboration which became Blotted Science, an all-instrumental extreme metal project. They released their debut album, The Machinations of Dementia, in the fall of 2007.When asked about his favorite Cannibal Corpse song, Webster answered: "I don't know, it would be hard to choose one that's the "best", but one of my favorites is "From Skin to Liquid", mainly because it was so different for us. It showed we didn't necessarily have to be playing at warp drive and have gory lyrics to be heavy."[3]Webster is recognized as an extremely experienced and talented metal bass player. He can play at exceptionally fast speeds, and does a signature 3-finger walk (a "galloping" finger motion). He revealed in a making-of DVD for Cannibal Corpse's album The Wretched Spawn that he initially started playing guitar but changed to bass because he felt he could master the instrument more quickly. Unlike usual heavy metal bassists that play at high speeds, Webster is able to play his instrument without the use of a pick, while still retaining a clean clear tone, which helps maintain clarity in the complex and very fast lines he plays in conjunction with the heavily distorted guitars of Cannibal Corpse."When I was six years old I took some acoustic guitar lessons. It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn "Mary Had a Little Lamb," and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun. In the beginning my concern was playing in a band."[1]"I took some lessons from a friend of mine when I first started. He was in the school jazz band and he taught me the basics. I didn't take lessons for about a year, but I started again when I was a senior in high school. I've had about four different teachers throughout the years, but I never took lessons for more than a few months. I did, however, gain a lot from them and I've tried to learn as much on my own as I can. Anything I can learn about music or bass playing, I'll try to learn. I mean, the more you learn and the more you apply to your playing, it just makes you a better musician."[4]"I liked the bass player from AC/DC. I really loved the stuff he did. Peter Baltes from Accept was another. I liked the really good guys too, but that seemed out of reach at the beginning. Geddy Lee from Rush and Steve Harris were like gods to me. Billy Sheehan was from Buffalo, and we all knew about Billy before the rest of the country did. Billy has been a legend in Buffalo for a long, long time. He's still one of my favorites. By the time I was listening to Cliff Burton I was getting a little better. I had been playing a year or so before I started listening to Metallica. I thought he was great. I always thought he could have been a little louder on those albums though. That's the thing. In thrash metal or any other kind of metal where the bass is playing exactly what the guitar is playing, automatically the bass went down in the mix. If you notice those older bands like Accept, the bass is doing something that's a little bit different from the guitar. It's more with the kick drum instead of playing the riff the guitar is doing. In thrash metal and then death metal, the bass player always wound up playing what the guitar player was doing most of the time. It's been a decade long fight for us to be heard in the mix."[1]"I'd like to do some instructional material, but I'm still not sure if I'll try and do a DVD or book though. It will probably be easier to do a DVD, actually. Hopefully I'll be able to come up with some stuff that's worth releasing. I definitely won't put anything out until I'm sure it's of really high quality, and full of lots of good information. Also, you might have heard about the possibility of us doing a tab book. Well, we still haven't found a publisher for that."[5]"I practice the most when I have something I'm working on that's difficult, like one of Pat's songs for example. I usually won't practice for more than 3 or 4 hours a day unless I'm really inspired, or I have some kind of deadline."[6]Besides playing bass, Alex has also contributed to lyric and music writing on many occasions for the band, some examples being "Fucked with a Knife," "Puncture Wound Massacre," "I Will Kill You," "Devoured by Vermin," "Unleashing the Bloodthirsty," "Scavenger consuming death," "Scourge of iron" and "Murder Worship".Webster is also known for his bass guitar solos/fills in such songs as "Addicted to Vaginal Skin", "Mangled", "The Undead Will Feast", "Crushing the Despised", "Fucked with a Knife", "Hammer Smashed Face", "The Discipline of Revenge", "Put Them To Death", "She Was Asking For It", "Staring Through The Eyes of the Dead", "Bloodlands", "They Deserve to Die", "Rabid", and "The Strangulation Chair".From 2013 to 2015 Webster wrote a monthly tuition column for the UK's Bass Guitar Magazine.Webster currently uses Spector 'Alex Webster Signature Edition'[7] (based on Euro 5lx basses), DR Strings, and His signature Hammer Smashed Bass pickups by Seymour Duncan paired with a Darkglass Electronics tone capsule preamp wired for 18 volt operation. All of his signature basses have been set up by scooter at granville guitars and are wired using 4 single stack knobs for reliability on a heavy tour rotation (1 volume with both pick ups hardwired and 3 tone controls) Before his signature model, he used Modulus Quantum 5 and Spector Euro 5lx basses. He also used a white 1987 Fender Precision bass on the albums Eaten Back to Life and Butchered at Birth, an Ibanez Sabre SB900 on the album Tomb of the Mutilated, an Ibanez Soundgear SR1500 on The Bleeding and both a 1971 Precision Bass with EMG Pickups and a Badass bridge on the C# songs as well as a Spector NS Series 5-string bass that was rented on Vile. In the past, he used an Ampeg SVT200T with an Ampeg 8x10 cabinet, then switched to the SVT-4PRO head. Later, he signed an endorsement deal with SWR and used 2 SWR SM-1500 and 2 SWR Megoliath 8x10 cabinets. Currently he is using Aguilar DB 751 and DB810 cabinets. Not much of an effects user, however on the album Torture he stated that he began using a Darkglass Microtubes B3K switched to a B7kU (2016) overdrive pedal and commented that it's the heaviest tone he has achieved yet. He also uses a Radial Bassbone and a Boss TU-2 Chromatic Tuner, and a Seymour Duncan Bass Studio Compressor.Webster is prominently featured in the heavy metal documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey where he comes off as musically knowledgeable and well-spoken."Cannibal Corpse's bassist Alex Webster exudes a quiet, intellectual and particularly amiable persona which seems so at odds with the music that he is a driving force behind that one is immediately reminded of the old adage about not judging books by their covers."- Sinister Online[8]When asked about what he likes to do in his spare time outside of Cannibal Corpse, Webster commented: "working out, I’ve been doing some martial arts stuff for a while  [sic] now, so I just like to run, I like to go mountain biking"[9]"I'm not very proud of myself if I lose my temper. That's something I would love to be able to change. I've worked on it throughout my life and hope to eventually have it conquered and react as peacefully as Gandhi in the worst situation."[1]"Forrest Gump, that was OK actually, but I prefer... I'll tell you what one of my favorite all-time movies was, as far as horror. I like The Shining and I like Jacob's Ladder. I don't know if you'd call Jacob's Ladder horror anyway, but I really liked that movie. I like, Jesus there's a lot of them... I like the Evil Dead stuff, just total splatter action and Nekromantik from Germany. I have a very bad copy of Necromantik 2 and it's all in German and you can barely watch it. You can't even see the picture, really, but I saw Necromantik 1 and it's classic. I was just in a bar in Paris where they were playing Necromantik while you were just hanging about in the bar – yes!" "I just like the really low budget splatter. It's fun. And I like high budget psychological horror like Jacob's Ladder and The Shining. Everything's entertaining for different reasons. Here's kinda the way I see it: you can appreciate a lot of different things for what they are. Like, we're obviously a much different type of death metal band from, say, My Dying Bride or something like that, but there's no reason you can't appreciate both of them for what they are. I like Anathema and My Dying Bride. I also like Morbid Angel and Vader, and I also like us and Autopsy – of course I like us! I'm in the band! You know what I mean. It's good for what it is. When I see a movie like Evil Dead I don't expect it to be like The Shining, just like a person who likes Cannibal Corpse. They shouldn't expect us to be like Anathema. You know what I'm saying? But they can like us for being... the Evil Dead of death metal! [laughs] And they can like those other bands for being more psychological or whatnot."[10] Alex is agnostic.The fossil marine worm species Websteroprion armstrongi is named for Webster, the researchers who named it — both heavy-metal fans — stated that "Alex Webster just seemed like the perfect fit for a giant worm with saw-like jaws".[11]"Films: Phantasm, Fargo, The Reflecting Skin, Burnt Offerings, The Shining, Goodfellas, Casino, Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, The Exorcist, Full Metal Jacket, The Warriors, City of God, Romper Stomper, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Freddy Got Fingered, The Road Warrior, and tons more..."Television: "Most of the original programming on HBO, I also watch the news a lot."Books: 1984 by George Orwell, Murder Machine by Gene Mustain and Jerry Capeci, The Westies by T.J. English, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion by Tolkien, Gulag by Anne Applebaum, etc..."[12]When asked about his favorite song on the Morbid Angel album Altars of Madness, Webster answered: "that whole album is so amazing, it's hard to choose. Maybe "Chapel of Ghouls", "Immortal Rites", or "Visions from the Darkside"."[13]In a 2006 interview, he commented that his favorite albums of the previous five years are Spawn of Possession's Cabinet, Necrophagist's Epitaph, Aeon's Bleeding the False, Hate Eternal's I, Monarch, and Spastic Ink's Ink Compatible.[14]His five all-time favorite albums are (in descending order) Accept's Restless and Wild, Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness, Metallica's Master of Puppets, Iron Maiden's Powerslave and Slayer's Reign in Blood.Alex Webster is a big Slayer fan. "I got into them back in the mid 80's. I learned about them through word of mouth from some other metal heads at my school. They were the best of the evil thrash bands at the time. I can't really stress how much I and the other Cannibal guys listened to Slayer. They were a massive influence on us."[15] He said that his favorite song lyric would be "anything by Slayer.."[4] He also said if any band could cover a Cannibal Corpse song, it would be Slayer.[4]"
Common ARTS;"Common ARTS (or Automated Radar Terminal System) is an air traffic control computer system that air traffic controllers use to track aircraft. The computer system is used to automate the air traffic controller's job by correlating the various radar and human inputs in a meaningful way. This system is being used in most of the TRACONs around the United States. Common ARTS is the most modern implementation of ARTS in use at various locations in the United States. Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) was designed to replace Common ARTS at all the US TRACONS, however that project was stalled until 2010.  The United States Federal Aviation Administration announced in Spring 2011 that STARS will be replacing the 11 largest CARTS sites under the TAMR Segment 3 Phase 1 plan. The remaining CARTS sites will be replaced under TAMR Segment 3 Phase 2 in the near future.A typical short range radar used in air traffic control will scan the area about 60 miles every 4–6 seconds. The primary signal returned will contain a range and azimuth of a target. Automation will correlate these targets scan to scan and make estimates of speed and direction. A secondary signal (Transponder (aviation)) may be available, containing the aircraft transponder code, and possibly altitude (and possibly other information if Mode S). The automation will correlate the primary and secondary signals, and measure horizontal and vertical speed estimates. Once the automation systems know the details of the aircraft it is tracking, this information is available on the display, as part of the datablock near the aircraft representation. The information will typically show an aircraft ID, if the transponder code is associated with a known flight plan, the altitude, and speed. Other systems can use the speed and direction information. The safety systems need to use this information. The conflict alert (CA) system will compare the direction, altitude and speed of multiple aircraft to see if there are any possibilities of aircraft being too close together. Maps of the area along with Mode C or S transponder elevations will allow minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) systems to warn controllers of possible terrain conflicts. Additional systems may include any of the Final Approach Spacing (FAST/pFAST) tools available, User Request Evaluation Tool, and Parallel Runway monitors.ARTS was developed in the late 1960s by Univac corporation to help automate the TRACONS operations in the United States. At many TRACONs, a Unisys mainframe computer was installed to handle the processing. In the early 1970s virtually all TRACONs in the US were running ARTS software to help track aircraft displayed on the radar console. The Burroughs Corporation was also working on radar display consoles in the 1970s to 1980s. In 1986, Univac and Burroughs Corporations merged creating Unisys.By the early 1980s an effort was proposed to port the ARTS functionality to microprocessors. Unisys began this program, and the name changed to CommonARTS. The CommonARTS processes were running on Motorola 68000 microprocessors. The software was mostly rewritten in the C language, running on various real-time operating systems. In the 1990s, Unisys split out some of the defense work, and Lockheed Martin acquired the air traffic management unit. In the 1990s, most of the Common ARTS software was ported to PowerPC processors, still using the same source code, but with larger memory footprint, allowing control of more aircraft. By 1997, there were 131 small to medium TRACONS and five large TRACONS running Common ARTS software. The PowerPC also allowed the display software to drive ARTS Color Displays (ACD) replacing the vector-based Full Digital ARTs Displays (FDAD). The STARS program was started to replace the Common ARTS systems at all TRACONS in the late 1990s. In the late 1990s Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) support was added to Common ARTS software to augment RADAR sensors. Multiple sensor inputs were added including long range (ARSR) allowing larger TRACONS to have variable size and shape sectors, since they no longer needed to have round coverage areas matching a single sensor scan area."

Río Piedras massacre;"The Río Piedras massacre occurred on October 24, 1935, at the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras. Puerto Rico Police officers confronted and opened fire on supporters of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Four Nationalist Party members were killed, and one police officer was wounded during the shooting.[1]In 1931, the U.S.-appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. named Dr. Carlos E. Chardón as Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico. He was the first Puerto Rican to have this position. In 1935, Chardón initiated a project based on the ideas of Luis Muñoz Marín, who at the time was a Senator in the Puerto Rican legislature and member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. It was known as the Reconstruction of Puerto Rico Project. The plan, which was within the New Deal criteria established by U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression, was well received and became known as Plan Chardón.[2]Pedro Albizu Campos, president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, knew that Roosevelt had been implicated as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in helping Secretary Albert Fall of the Department of Interior to arrange for private leasing of Navy oil fields, in what became known as the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.[2]  Albizu Campos worried that Plan Chardón would strip Puerto Rico of her natural resources. He believed that Chardón had been placed in charge of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) in order to "Americanize" the university with the support of the Liberal Party.[2] On October 20, 1935, in a political meeting which the Nationalist Party held in the town of Maunabo and which was transmitted by radio, Albizu Campos denounced Chardón, the university deans and the Liberal Party as traitors, saying they wanted to convert the university into an "American" propaganda institution.[3]On October 23, 1935, a group of students at the university who supported Chardón began to collect signatures for a petition to declare Albizu Campos "Student Enemy Number One." In turn, a protest against the group by the pro-Nationalist faction of students denounced Chardón and the Liberal Party as agents of the United States.[4]On October 24, 1935, a student assembly held at the university declared Albizu Campos as persona non grata. Chardón requested that the governor provide armed Puerto Rico Police officers on the university grounds, in case the situation turned violent. Two police officers spotted a "suspicious-looking vehicle" and asked the driver, Ramón S. Pagán, and his friend Pedro Quiñones, for identification. A struggle ensued, and the police killed Pagán and Quiñones.  The local newspaper, El Mundo, reported on October 25, that the day before observers heard an explosion followed by gunfire, Eduardo Rodríguez Vega and José Santiago Barea were also killed that day.[4]An eyewitness, Isolina Rondón, testified that she saw the police officers shooting at the victims and heard one police officer screaming "not to let them escape alive." Her testimony was ignored, and no charges were filed against the police officers. The Río Piedras massacre left four men dead.[5][6]The supporters of the Nationalist Party killed during the shooting were:[6]A bystander (not a Nationalist) who was also killed:[8]Among the wounded were:At the time of the massacre, the top-ranking U.S.-appointed police chief on the island was a former U.S. Army Colonel named Elisha Francis Riggs. Colonel Elisha Francis Riggs was born in Georgetown in northwest Washington, D.C. and was appointed Chief of Police of Puerto Rico in 1933, by Blanton Winship, the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico. He was an unpopular police chief, stemming from his decisions to repress the growing organized labor movement among sugar cane workers and the Nationalist Pro-Independence Movement. Since the entire Puerto Rico Police took their orders from Colonel Riggs, the Nationalist Party considered him responsible for the massacre.[11]On February 23, 1936, Colonel Riggs was assassinated by the Nationalists Hiram Rosado and Elías Beauchamp, both members of the Cadets of the Republic, the paramilitary wing of the Nationalist Party. They attacked and fatally shot the police chief as he was returning home after attending Mass at San Juan's Cathedral. Rosado and Beauchamp were arrested and were either subjected to summary execution or shot while attempting to escape at Puerto Rico Police headquarters in San Juan. Before his death, Beauchamp posed giving a military salute for a news photographer.[1][12]News of the assassination spread throughout the United States. The Puerto Rican Senator, Luis Muñoz Marín, who was in Washington, D.C. at the time, was asked by Ernest Gruening, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (1935–1937), to publicly condemn Col. Riggs's assassination. Senator Muñoz Marín declined, unless he was also allowed to condemn the Puerto Rico Police for allegedly executing the two assassins without trial.[1]Gruening joined US Senator Millard Tydings from Maryland, a Democrat, in a 1943 legislative proposal to grant independence to Puerto Rico. Although the measure was welcomed by every political party in Puerto Rico, including Muñoz' Liberal Party, the senator opposed the measure. Senator Muñoz Marín said that independence would hurt Puerto Rico's economy. He contrasted the proposed bill with the provisions of the Tydings–McDuffie Act, which provided independence for the Philippines after a 10-year transition period. Due to his opposition, the bill did not progress in Congress, and Puerto Rico did not receive its political independence from the U.S.[1]In 1950, the 81st United States Congress passed legislation to enable the people of Puerto Rico to organize a local government pursuant to a constitution of their own, comparable to those of other territories and states of the United States. From its enactment until this day, the act has served as the organic law for the government of Puerto Rico and its relation with the United States. Muñoz Marín, as Governor of Puerto Rico, supported the measure. Muñoz Marín became the first native-born elected governor of Puerto Rico.[13]After Col. Riggs's assassination, many Nationalist Party leaders were imprisoned. Members of the Puerto Rican independence movement came under greater scrutiny and prosecution. Among the leaders arrested were Pedro Albizu Campos, Juan Antonio Corretjer, Luis F. Velazquez, Clemente Soto Vélez, Erasmo Velazquez, Julio H. Velazquez, Juan Gallardo Santiago, Juan Juarbe Juarbe, and Pablo Rosado Ortiz. They were later released on $10,000 bail.[9] The Nationalist Rafael Ortiz Pacheco fled to the Dominican Republic.[5]These leaders were charged with having "conspired to overthrow" the U.S. government on the island. They were tried in the U.S. District Court in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. The first trial jury, which included a minority of Puerto Ricans among its members, ended in a hung jury. A second jury was picked, consisting solely of "Anglo-Americans." This jury found every Nationalist charged to be "guilty", with the exception of Juarbe Juarbe.  The guilty findings and sentences were appealed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston, MA, which affirmed the lower court’s determinations.[14]"

Edgar Baird;"Edgar Albert Baird, ONL (May 28, 1911 – May 1, 2005) was a businessman born in Campbellton in the Dominion of Newfoundland. Baird was the founder of the Newfoundland chapter of the Junior Forest Rangers, and worked in the forestry and aviation industry where he was Chief Woods Ranger for Newfoundland, responsible for forest fire protection initiatives for Newfoundland and Labrador.As superintendent of the Newfoundland Forestry Unit, Baird led a battalion of 960 foresters to Scotland in 1940, the largest single battalion ever to leave the province. In 1941 he signed up with the Royal Air Force and rose to the rank of Flight Lieutenant.Following the war, Baird led a group of local residents who were lobbying to form a new town site in what would become  Gander. He was later appointed the first chairman of the Gander Local Improvement District and built the first private dwelling in Gander in 1951. Both a Gander street and local trail are named in his honour.In 1961, Baird volunteered as fire boss during the great forest fire that devastated Bonavista North.He was invested as a member of the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2004."

Gita Mittal;"Justice Gita Mittal (born 9 December 1958) is an Indian judge.She is the former Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court and the first woman judge to serve in that capacity.[2] She has also served as the Acting Chief Justice and Judge of Delhi High Court.Mittal was educated at Lady Irwin School in Delhi, graduating in 1975 with a focus on science.[3] As a school student she was a member of the Girl Guides in India, and represented the organisation internationally at several events.[4] She went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with Honours from the Lady Shriram College for Women, Delhi, in 1978, and also participated actively in athletics, acting as Sports President of the Lady Shri Ram College (1977-1978).[3] Mittal studied law at the Campus Law Center in Delhi, graduating with an LL.B in 1981.[3]Mittal practiced law in Delhi from 1981 to 2004, prior to her appointment as an Additional Judge in the Delhi High Court.[3] She also acted as a counsel for the Delhi Development Authority, appearing for them in a case concerning demolitions of illegal structures.[5]Mittal was appointed an additional judge to the Delhi High Court on 16 July 2004, and was confirmed as a permanent judge on 20 February 2006.[3] During her tenure as a High Court judge, she heard both civil and criminal matters.During her tenure as a High Court Judge, Mittal served on a number of administrative and judicial committees at the Court. She was the Chair of the Delhi High Court's Mediation and Conciliation Center, and served on committees that dealt with complaints concerning sexual harassment, working conditions, performance assessment of judges in subordinate courts, and judicial training.[3]  Mittal also served on a committee concerning the implementation of legal guidelines that governed child witnesses in cases concerning sexual offences.[3] As part of this, she led an initiative to establish special courtrooms for vulnerable witnesses in the Delhi High Court, with the first such courtroom being established in 2012.[3][6]On 14 April 2017, Mittal was appointed the Acting Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court.[3]On 17 May 2016, the Times of India published an article reporting that a litigant had written to the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court, complaining that Justice Mittal's disposal of cases was slow and constrained by her involvement in administrative work, as a result of which she allegedly did not sit in court for a sufficient period of time to hear matters, and that this had personally affected the litigant.[7] Times of India reported that they had verified the numbers presented by the litigant and confirmed them.[7] Justice Mittal's office responded, indicating that the litigant had no pending cases in her court.[7] The report was widely criticised by members of the Bar. The Delhi High Court Bar Association condemned it as inaccurate[8] and thirty-four senior advocates wrote a letter to the Times of India calling on the newspaper to issue an apology to Justice Mittal for inaccuracies in their report, and attesting to her work at the Delhi High Court in disposing of disputes.[9] On 31 May 2016, it was reported that the Delhi High Court had accepted an unconditional apology from Times of India for the report.[10]Mittal wrote a number of significant judgments as a judge at the Delhi High Court, many of which concern the conditions of service and recruitment in military and para-military forces in India. In 2011, along with Justice R. Midha she passed a significant ruling concerning the rights of transgender individuals, holding that a woman with a congenital hormonal anomaly had been unfairly discriminated against when she was prohibited from joining the Sashastra Seema Bal (a border patrol organisation) as a female constable.[11] In 2013, along with Justice Deepa Sharma, she held that colour-blindness could not be grounds for discrimination in the context of promotion in the Central Reserve Police Force.[12] In 2018, she held that advertisements prohibiting women from applying for recruitment to the Indian Territorial Army violated the Territorial Army Act, 1948, which allows men and women to apply.[13][14]She has also served on the benches of several significant cases concerning political figures. In 2013, she held that Congress leader N.D. Tiwari could not be compelled to provide a blood sample against his will, in a paternity suit filed against him, although an adverse inference could be drawn from his refusal to provide the sample.[15] Her order was later reversed by a different High Court bench, which compelled him to provide a sample.[16] However, in 2016, along with Justice IS Mehta, she laid down principles that courts should follow in hearing cases concerning pleas for court-ordered paternity tests.[17] In 2014, along with Justice J.R. Midha, she dismissed an appeal filed in the Nitish Katara murder case, upholding the trial court's conviction of Vikas Yadav, the son of Uttar Pradesh politician D.P. Yadav.[18] In 2017, along with Justice C. Hari Shankar, she dismissed an appeal filed by retired Calcutta High Court judge C.S. Karnan, in which he had challenged the constitutionality of the Indian Contempt of Courts Act.[19]Mittal has also contributed to jurisprudence that focuses on constitutional rights. In 2013 she ruled that the Delhi High Court could not prohibit entry to persons who didn't have identity cards, noting that access to justice would be impeded by such a rule.[20] In August 2018, she and Justice C. Hari Shankar found that the provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 were largely unconstitutional, and struck it down.[21]On 3 August 2018, Mittal was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir.[4] She is the first female Chief Justice of that court.She retired on 8 December 2020.[22][23]In 2019, Mittal wrote to the Supreme Court of India calling for the appointment of additional judges to handle the caseload at the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, noting that the Court was functioning at half its judicial capacity with only ten judges serving instead of the allocated seventeen.[24] Justice Mittal forwarded seven names for the consideration of the Supreme Court collegium, which appoints judges to the High Courts in India.[24] In April 2020, three Permanent Judges were appointed to the Court, bringing the total number of serving judges to thirteen.[25]In May 2020, Mittal wrote to the Government of India in her capacity as Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, calling for the establishment of a bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal in Jammu and Kashmir, to hear cases concerning the service conditions of officers in the Indian Administrative Service.[26][27] In her letter she noted that the passing of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act 2019 had resulted in the need to transfer a number of pending service matters from the High Court to such tribunals.[26] The publication of her letter met with opposition from the Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Justice L. Narasimha Reddy, who disputed the need for a separate bench in Jammu and Kashmir at that time.[28] In April 2020, the Central Government issued a notification extending the jurisdiction of the Chandigarh bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal to Jammu and Kashmir, however, following criticisms that this would cause difficulties in access, the Government modified its order to create a separate Central Administrative Tribunal bench in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.[29]On 25 October 2019, Mittal authored a significant judgment in Suhail Rashid Bhat v State of Jammu and Kashmir, striking down the Jammu & Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Act, 1960, a law drawing from colonial legal principles to penalise poverty and public movement.[30] Along with Justice Rajesh Bindal, she held that the criminalisation of beggary violated constitutional principles and constituted a “disproportionate infringement of the right to meaningful life, dignity, privacy and liberty guaranteed under Article 21”.[31]Mittal has served as a member of the Advisory Board constituted under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange & Prevention of Smuggling Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA).[3]In February 2008, she was appointed the sole judge in a tribunal constituted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 to investigate a ban on the activities of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).[3] As judge, Mittal found that the government did not have grounds to enforce an extension of a previous ban against SIMI, as it had failed to present new evidence to support its argument for the extension.[32][33] Her decision was stayed soon after by the Supreme Court, allowing the ban on SIMI to continue.[34][35]Mittal has served on the governing boards of several educational institutions. She has been a member of the Governing Council of the National Law University, Delhi since 2008, and Governing Council of the Indian Law Institute, New Delhi since 2013.[3][36] She was a member of the Delhi University Court from 1999 to 2004, and was nominated to the governing body of Ram Lal Anand College in Delhi from 1997 to 1999.[3]Justice Mittal also serves on the editorial advisory board of the National Law University Delhi's Journal of Legal Studies.[37]In 2008, the Vice President of India, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, awarded Mittal the 'Distinguished Alumna Award' from Lady Shriram College, recognising her contributions to jurisprudence.[3] In 2019, she received the Justice P.N. Bhagwati Award for her contributions towards improving access to justice and for her work in designing and introducing special courts for vulnerable victims in the Delhi High Court.[38]In 2017, Mittal was one of the recipients of the Nari Shakti Puraskar, a civilian honour presented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development of the Government of India to individuals and organisations contributing to female empowerment.[39] Her acceptance of a government award while serving as a judge led to public criticism and concerns about conflicts of interest and the independence of the judiciary, particularly as it was the first instance of a sitting judge accepting an award from the government.[40] Several advocates and retired judges noted that prior to this, only retired judges had accepted government awards, and argued that her acceptance of a government award ought to disqualify her from hearing cases in which the government is a litigant.[41]"
Marrubium;"Marrubium (horehound or hoarhound) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, native to temperate regions of Europe, North Africa, and Asia as far east as the Xinjiang region of western China. A few species are also naturalized in North and South America.[1][2][3][4]The genus name Marrubium derives from the Latin word marrubii, meaning horehound. The French Talmudic exegete, Rashi, thinks that this herb may have been used as one of the bitter herbs on the night of Passover.[5] The common English name horehound is of unknown origin, but with the first part 'hore' derived from "hoary", "hairy".The species formerly classified as Marrubium nigrum (Black Horehound) is now placed in the genus Ballota.Marrubium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora lineolea."

Eren Eyüboğlu;"Eren Eyüboğlu (née Ernestine Leibovici,[1] 1913–1988)[2][3] was a Romanian-born Turkish painter, ceramicst, and mosaic artist.[4] She is considered one of the forerunners of modernism in Turkey.[5]Ernestine Leibovici was born on February 5, 1913 in Iași, Romania. She attended George Enescu National University of Arts (formerly Academy of Fine Arts Lași), where she graduated in 1928.[4] From 1930 to 1932, she continued her education at Andre Lhote's studio (also known as Academy André Lhote) in Paris and Académie Julian.[4][6] In 1933, she studied art in Istanbul.[4]In 1933, she married artist Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu, whom she met at Andre Lhote's studio.[4][7] When she married, Ernestine adopted the Turkish name “Eren”.[1] Bedri would go on to have an affair with artist Mari Gerekmezyan in the 1940s, which put a strain on their marriage.[8]Eyüboğlu worked in many different mediums, including ceramic, charcoal, oil, watercolor, and gouache.[9] She took part in D Group exhibitions starting in 1936, as well as the Edinburgh Art Festival in 1957, and the Hamburg Turkish Women Painters Exhibition in 1958.[10] In 1941, she had her first solo exhibition.[10]She died on August 30, 1988 in Kalamış, Turkey.[11] Her work is in museum collections, including at Grey Art Gallery, and Istanbul Museum of Modern Art.[12][1]In 2020, her work was part of the exhibition, “Modernisms: Iranian, Turkish and Indian Highlights from NYU’s Abby Grey Collection” at the Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University.[13]"
Special Forces Command (Switzerland);"The Special Forces Command (German: Kommando Spezialkräfte) is an infantry corps of the Swiss Armed Forces specialised in rapid offensive operations, intel gathering and operations in urban areas, open fields and other difficult terrains, capable of acting on short notice.[3] Grenadiers are subjected to considerable physical strain, applicants are required to be in excellent physical conditions, and recruits are chosen through a strict selection process.[4]The Grenadiers have been part of the Grenadier Command 1 since the "Army XXI" reform in late 2004, before which Grenadier units were integrated in other regiments. Grenadier Command 1, subordinated to the "Reconnaissance Formations of the Armed Forces and Grenadiers", is headquartered in Rivera.[2] The Grenadiers' motto, shared with many other military institutions and most famously with the US Marines, is "Semper Fidelis".[5]Soldiers denominated "grenadiers" have long been part of Switzerland's military tradition: even before the 19th century, grenadiers served as part of the cantonal contingents of the Swiss Confederacy.[6] Modern Grenadiers were formed in the early 1940s, originating from the "Infantry Pioneers" trained by Chief instructor Matthias Brunner, the commander of a riflemen company who developed a close combat technique in the shooting schools of Walenstadt. This company, made up of volunteers, faced a stricter and more intensive training than other infantry companies.[7]In 1943, General Henri Guisan, convinced of the necessity of shock troops specially trained for close combat, decided to form a similar company in each of the 37 infantry regiments of the army. In the same year, the designation of "Grenadiers" replaced that of "Pioneers", marking the birth of the corps. Also in 1943, the first recruit school of Grenadiers were held in Locarno and Solduno.[8] After the war, the makeshift training grounds were relocated twice, first to Losone, but after complains about having a military installation in a touristic area they were moved again to Isone, where they remain to this day.[9]In 1968, to answer the necessity of a specific training for combat and deployment in difficult terrains, units of Mountain Grenadiers were created. In 1970 Airborne Grenadiers, while subordinated to aviation troops, were first trained in the Grenadier recruit school. In 1971, companies of motorised Grenadiers were created.[10] In the 1970s, the guerrilla tactics first introduced in 1943 were resumed and adapted with the name of "hunting war" (German: Jagdkrieg).[11] The Army XXI reform of 2004 reassembled all Grenadier formations of the previous "Army 95" model in the Grenadier Command 1.[2]The Special Forces Command is an infantry formation of about 3,000 soldiers and consists of the following units:[12]The recruitment process of Grenadier units takes place one year before recruit school, and generally matches the ones of other corps, with the exception that one must volunteer to become a Grenadier. Those interested are subjected to comprehensive medical and psychological tests.[13]Recruit school, extending over a period of 23 weeks, is very demanding, both physically and psychologically.

Composite video;"Composite video is an analog video signal format that carries standard-definition video (typically at 525 lines or 625 lines) as a single channel. Video information is encoded on one channel, unlike the higher-quality S-Video (two channels) and the even higher-quality component video (three or more channels). In all of these video formats, audio is carried on a separate connection.Composite video is also known by the initials CVBS for composite video baseband signal or color, video, blanking and sync,[3][4] or is simply referred to as SD video for the standard-definition television signal it conveys.There are three dominant variants of composite video signals, corresponding to the analog color system used: NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. Usually composite video is carried by a yellow RCA connector, but other connections are used in professional settings.A composite video signal combines, on one wire, the video information required to recreate a color picture, as well as line and frame synchronization pulses. The color video signal is a linear combination of the luminance (Y{\displaystyle Y}) of the picture and a modulated subcarrier which carries the chrominance or color information (C{\displaystyle C}), a combination of hue and saturation. Details of the combining process vary between the NTSC, PAL and SECAM systems.The frequency spectrum of the modulated color signal overlaps that of the baseband signal, and separation relies on the fact that frequency components of the baseband signal tend to be near harmonics of the horizontal scanning rate, while the color carrier is selected to be an odd multiple of half the horizontal scanning rate, this produces a modulated color signal that consists mainly of harmonic frequencies that fall between the harmonics in the baseband luma signal, rather than both being in separate continuous frequency bands alongside each other in the frequency domain. The signals may be separated using a comb filter.[5] In other words, the combination of luma and chrominance is indeed a frequency-division technique, but it is much more complex than typical frequency-division multiplexing systems like the one used to multiplex analog radio stations on both the AM and FM bands.A gated and filtered signal derived from the color subcarrier, called the burst or colorburst, is added to the horizontal blanking interval of each line (excluding lines in the vertical sync interval) as a synchronizing signal and amplitude reference for the chrominance signals. In NTSC composite video, the burst signal is inverted in phase (180° out of phase) from the reference subcarrier.[6] In PAL, the phase of the color subcarrier alternates on successive lines. In SECAM, no colorburst is used since phase information is irrelevant.The combining of component signals to form the composite signal does the same, causing a checkerboard video artifact known as dot crawl. Dot crawl is a defect that results from crosstalk due to the intermodulation of the chrominance and luminance components of the signal. This is usually seen when chrominance is transmitted with high bandwidth, and its spectrum reaches into the band of the luminance frequencies. Comb filters are commonly used to separate signals and eliminate these artifacts from composite sources. S-Video and component video avoid this problem as they maintain the component signals separately.Most home analog video equipment record a signal in (roughly) composite format: LaserDiscs store a true composite signal, while consumer videotape formats (including VHS and Betamax) and commercial and industrial tape formats (including U-matic) use modified composite signals (generally known as color-under).[7] The professional D-2 videocassette format digitally records and reproduces composite video signals using PCM encoding of the analog signal on the magnetic tape.A number of so-called extensions to the visible TV image can be transmitted using composite video. Since TV screens hide the vertical blanking interval of a composite video signal, these take advantage of the unseen parts of the signal. Examples of extensions include teletext, closed captioning, information regarding the show title, a set of reference colors that allows TV sets to automatically correct NTSC hue maladjustments, widescreen signaling (WSS) for switching between 4:3 and 16:9 display formats, etc.In home applications, the composite video signal is typically connected using an RCA connector, normally yellow. It is often accompanied with red and white connectors for right and left audio channels respectively. BNC connectors and higher quality coaxial cable are often used in professional television studios and post-production applications. BNC connectors were also used for composite video connections on early home VCRs, often accompanied by either RCA connector or a 5-pin DIN connector for audio. The BNC connector, in turn, post dated the PL-259 connector featured on first-generation VCRs.Video cables are 75 ohm impedance, low in capacitance. Typical values run from 52 pF/m for an HDPE-foamed dielectric precision video cable to 69 pF/m for a solid PE dielectric cable.[9]Some devices that connect to a TV, such as VCRs, older video game consoles and home computers, output a composite signal. This may then be converted to RF with an external box known as an RF modulator that generates the proper carrier (often for channel 3 or 4 in North America, channel 36 in Europe). Sometimes this modulator was built into the product (such as video game consoles, VCRs, or the Atari, Commodore 64, or TRS-80 CoCo home-computers) and sometimes it was an external unit powered by the computer (in the case of the TI-99/4A or some Apple modulators) or with an independent power supply.[a]Because of the digital television transition most TV sets sold these days no longer have analog television tuners and cannot accept a signal from an analog modulator. But because composite video has a well-established market for both devices that convert it to channel 3/4 outputs, as well as devices that convert things like VGA to composite, it has offered opportunities to repurpose older composite monitors for newer devices.The process of modulating RF with the original video signal, and then demodulating the original signal again in the TV, introduces losses including added noise or interference. For these reasons, it is best to use composite connections instead of RF connections if possible. Older video equipment and some very low-end modern televisions have only RF input (essentially the antenna jack). While RF modulators are no longer common, they are still available to translate composite signals for older equipment."
Social Democratic Party (Estonia);"The Social Democratic Party (Estonian: Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond, SDE) is a centre-left political party in Estonia.[2] It is currently led by Lauri Läänemets.[3]The party was formerly known as the Moderate People's Party (Estonian: Rahvaerakond Mõõdukad).[4] The SDE has been a member of the Party of European Socialists since 16 May 2003 and was a member of the Socialist International from November 1990 to 2017.[5] It is orientated towards the principles of social-democracy,[6][7] and it supports Estonia's membership in the European Union.[8]During the perestroika era, the Estonian Social Democratic Party (Eesti Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Partei, ESDP) was formed as Estonia's social-democratic movements merged in 1990. The movements were: the Estonian Democratic Labour Party, the Estonian Social Democratic Independence Party, the Russian Social Democratic Party of Estonia and the Estonian Socialist Party's Foreign Association (successor of Estonian Socialist Workers Party in exile). The ESDP's first leader was Marju Lauristin. They restored their contacts with the Socialist International in 1990. ESDP formed an electoral alliance with the agrarian Estonian Rural Centre Party (formed in 1990) for 1992 and 1995 elections. In 1996, after electoral defeat these two parties finally merged and named themselves the Moderates (Mõõdukad). The Moderates were accepted as a full member of the Socialist International at its 20th congress in September 1999.[9]In 1999 the Moderates and the centre-right People's Party, set up in May 1998 after a fusion of Peasants' Party and People's Party of Republicans and Conservatives (a 1994 splinter group from the Fatherland Alliance), formed the Moderate People's Party (Rahvaerakond Mõõdukad). The seemingly unlikely decision to fuse took place on 29 May 1999, with some foreign commentators drawing parallels with 'right-wing socialists'.[10] In November the same year, the unification was formally approved by party's general assembly.The Moderates' contacts with People's Party predecessors had started in 1998. The two parties had a joint list in 1999 parliamentary election and formed a governing coalition with Pro Patria Union and Reform Party. In 2003, the Moderate People's Party joined the Party of European Socialists. After disappointing election results in 2003, the party renamed itself the Social Democratic Party (SDE) on 7 February 2004.It was the most successful party in the 2004 European Parliamentary Election, obtaining 36.8% of the national vote (most of which went to their leading candidate Toomas Hendrik Ilves) and returning 3 MEPs.The SDE is committed to the social market economy model, in addition to conventional social-democratic values including equality, social justice, solidarity, and the welfare state. On 10 May 2005 former social-liberals Peeter Kreitzberg and Sven Mikser joined them. On 28 November former social-liberal Mark Soosaar re-joined the SDE. The party was in opposition from 2002 on, but they participated talks for a common alternative presidential candidate to Arnold Rüütel, SDE's Toomas Hendrik Ilves was elected on 23 September 2006 as the next president of Estonia (apart from the Social Democrats, he was supported by the Reform Party of Estonia, Pro Patria Union and Res Publica deputies).After last elections to the local government councils on 16 October 2005, the party in most major cities is in opposition, but are a part of the governing coalition in Rakvere and Tapa. The party improved its position in most areas. In Tallinn, it formed a joint list with the agrarian People's Union, which got 6 seats out of 63 seats with 11.1% share of votes. Comparing to 2003. elections to the local government council in Tallinn SDE and People's Union gained seats. In the 2003 election, SDE got a 4.9% share of votes and People's Union 3.4% share of votes, which were both below a 5% election threshold. In Estonia, SDE local lists won 6.43% share of votes. In 2003 they got only 4.39% share of votes nationally. SDE is today represented on 65 local councils out of 206 and is governing in 20 local councils. After the 2003 election the party was represented in 104 local councils out of 247.SDE's aim in the 2007 Estonian parliamentary election was to win at least 17 seats out of 101. Independent member of current Riigikogu Liina Tõnisson ran as a candidate in their list. All SDE's MEPs and their current MPs were candidates in the 2007 election. The party got 58,354 votes (10.6% of the total), a gain of +3.6%, it won 10 seats in the new Riigikogu, a gain of four.In April 2007, the Social Democrats joined the coalition government led by the Estonian Reform Party.In the 2011 parliamentary election on 6 March 2011, the SDE received 17.1% of the vote and 19 seats.The small Russian Party in Estonia merged into the SDE in 2012.Following the resignation of Prime Minister Andrus Ansip, a new cabinet was sworn in on 26 March 2014, with Taavi Rõivas of the Reform Party serving as Prime Minister in coalition with the SDE.[11]In the 2014 European elections held on 25 May 2014, the SDE won 13.6% of the national vote, electing a single Member of the European Parliament.[12]In the 2015 parliamentary election on 1 March 2015, the SDE received 15.2% of the vote and 15 seats in the Riigikogu.[13] After the coalition formation with Reform and IRL, MP Jevgeni Ossinovski announced that he would challenge Sven Mikser in the party congress on 30 May 2015.[14] Mikser however stepped down before the election at the congress and Ossinovski was chosen as the new party leader.[15] On 7 November 2016, the Social Democratic Party and IRL announced that they were asking Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas to resign and were planning on negotiating a new majority government.[16] In the following vote of confidence on 9 November, the majority of Riigikogu voted in favor of removing the prime minister's government.[17]On 23 November 2016, a new coalition government consisting of the Estonian Centre Party, SDE and IRL was sworn in.[18]The party was in government in the following periods: 1992–1994 (Mart Laar's first government), 1994–1995 (Andres Tarand's government, often called to Christmas Peace government [jõulurahu valitsus]), 1999–2002 (Mart Laar's second government, often called the Triple Alliance [kolmikliit]), and 2007–2009, some of which included participating in three centre-right governments with the Fatherland Union and Reform Party. The party will return to government in Kaja Kallas' second cabinet on 18 July 2022 in a coalition with Reform and Isamaa.The following are MPs representing the party in the legislature, along with their electoral district[19]Since 2019 the SDE has 2 MEPs:logo of the Moderate People's Partylogo until 2016logo 2016–"

Audi RS5 Turbo DTM;"The Audi RS5 Turbo DTM is a Class One Touring Car constructed by the German car manufacturer Audi AG for use in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters. The car was an updated version of the previous Audi RS5 DTM that had a naturally aspirated engine. The Audi RS5 Turbo DTM would remain to be based on the production Audi RS5 car. The car made its DTM debut in the 2019 season under "Class 1" regulations and was used until the 2020 season. The RS5 Turbo is Audi's first-turbo powered DTM car.[citation needed]With a total of 12 wins, 12 pole positions, 18 podium finishes and a total record of 1,132 manufacturer's championship points in 2019, the RS5 Turbo DTM is statistically the fourth most dominant DTM car in the history of the sport with a win percentage of 66.67% against the sport's most dominant car, the 2003 Mercedes CLK DTM with a record of 90%. The car brought Audi its first year of domination in its history in the sport.[citation needed]At the end of the 2020 season, Audi Sport left DTM after 31 years of participation (with an exception of 1993–1996) as they will be focusing on Formula E. This was the last Audi vehicle in DTM before they left the sport.[3]Audi carried over the RS5 DTM car to undergo a major development for the Class 1 project which will be used for the 2019 season and beyond and rebrand it as Audi RS5 Turbo DTM. The aerodynamic packages of the RS5 Turbo DTM also has significant change including front splitter length cut to 90 millimetres, radiator grill revamp, rear wing width increased to 520 millimetres and also DRS improvement to make cars aggressive for overtaking compared to the Audi RS5 DTM naturally-aspirated. The car made its first shakedown at Circuito do Estoril on 8 November 2018.[citation needed]The design also features the newly-firewall interior cockpit protection to deflect debris away from a driver's head in the event of an accident.[citation needed]The RS5 Turbo DTM features a brand-new RC8 2.0 TFSI engine package built specifically for the car that based on Japanese Super GT GT500 Class 1 regulations dubbed Nippon Race Engine (NRE). The aging Audi 4.0 litres (244 cubic inches) V8 naturally-aspirated engine—which had been used since the inaugural season of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters— was replaced by a 2.0 litres (122 cubic inches) inline-4 turbocharged direct-injected RC8 engine developed by Audi which was full custom-built but the cylinder blocks from RC8 engine borrowed from Volkswagen-Audi EA888 2.0 R4 16v TSI/TFSI. During the car's shakedown and preliminary testing phase at the Circuito do Estoril, drivers noted that the change from natural aspiration to a turbocharger meant that the RS5 Turbo DTM required a different driving style to its predecessor, the Audi RS5 DTM NA, as the turbocharger produced more torque and thus required the driver to exercise greater control over the throttle. The Audi RC8 TFSI I-4 turbo engine will also feature the push-to-pass for overtaking manoeuvre improvement.[citation needed]"
Boeing F3B;"The Boeing F3B was a biplane fighter and fighter bomber that served with the United States Navy from 1928 into the early 1930s.Designed by the company as its Model 74, the plane was an incremental improvement over the F2B. The Navy-designated prototype XF3B-1 still had the tapered wings of the F2B for instance, but was built as a single-float seaplane using the FB-5 undercarriage. However, the growing use of aircraft carriers took away most of the need for floating fighters, and by the time other test results had been taken into account, the production F3B-1 (Model 77) had a larger upper wing that was slightly swept back and a redesigned tail with surfaces made from corrugated aluminum.[2] It also eliminated the spreader bar arrangement of the undercarriage and revised the vertical tail shape.[3]It first flew on 3 February 1928, turning in a respectable performance and garnering Boeing a contract for 73 more. F3Bs served as fighter-bombers for some four years with the squadrons VF-2B aboard USS Langley, VB-2B aboard USS Saratoga (later VF-6B), and VB-1B on USS Lexington,[1][3] during which period some were fitted with Townend rings and others with streamlined wheel fairings.[2] The aircraft remained in first-line service to 1932 and were then retained as "hacks" (command and staff transports) for several more years.[3]Data from The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft [3]General characteristicsPerformanceArmamentRelated developmentRelated lists"

Lord & Taylor Building;"The Lord & Taylor Building is an 11-story commercial building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, that formerly served as Lord & Taylor's flagship department store in the city. It is at 424–434 Fifth Avenue between 38th and 39th Streets.Designed by Starrett & van Vleck in the Italian Renaissance Revival style, the building contains a two-story base of limestone, a gray brick facade, copper cornices, and a chamfered corner. It was described as the first "frankly commercial" structure on Fifth Avenue north of 34th Street, and it replaced several of the company's previous headquarters.The building was constructed from 1913 to 1914 and served as Lord & Taylor's flagship store for over a hundred years. During the building's operation as Lord & Taylor's flagship store, it was renovated several times, and by the late 20th century, the store had expanded into an adjacent building. The Lord & Taylor Building was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on October 30, 2007. The building was mostly sold in a joint venture to workspace company WeWork in 2019. Amazon acquired the building in 2020, with plans to open an office there in 2023.The Lord & Taylor Building is located on an L-shaped lot at 424–434 Fifth Avenue between West 38th and 39th Streets in Midtown Manhattan.[2] Its frontage totals about 260 feet (79 m) to the south on 38th Street, 200 feet (61 m) to the west, 160 feet (49 m) to the north on 39th Street, and 150 feet (46 m) to the east on Fifth Avenue. The lot wraps around the Dreicer Building, erected on a holdout lot at 39th Street and Fifth Avenue, which was separately owned when the Lord & Taylor Building was erected. The holdout lot's owner had refused to sell the land,[3][4] and the Dreicer Building was ultimately combined with the Lord & Taylor Building after 1992.[5]The 11-story Lord & Taylor Building was designed by Starrett & van Vleck in the Italian Renaissance Revival style.[3] The total square footage of the building exceeds 600,000 square feet (56,000 m2) and includes two basement levels and ten above-ground levels.[4]The 10-story facade of the building is split into three layers:[3] the two-story limestone base, the brick-bonded facade of the third through eighth floors, and the terracotta-faced ninth and tenth floors.[6] The ninth- and tenth-floor facade is designed to look like a colonnade with the windows located in recessed bays between the "columns" of the colonnade.[3][4] These "columns" are spaced at intervals of 22 feet (6.7 m).[4] The chamfered corner at Fifth Avenue and 38th Street, which intersects at a 45-degree angle with each facade, is a visual element that unites the Fifth Avenue and 38th Street elevations. The chamfer is clad with terracotta below the eighth floor and blends with the colonnade wrapping around the ninth- and tenth-floor facades.[7] The section of the facade that wraps around the holdout lot is windowless and undecorated.[6]Decorative elements were used sparingly on the facade. These included the two-story coffer-vaulted main entrance on Fifth Avenue, the balustrade and balconies on the facade, the ninth- and tenth-floor colonnade, and the copper cornice on the facade above the tenth floor.[3] The main entrance was spanned by an arch topped by an elaborately decorated keystone, while cartouches and other decorations were present in other parts of the entrance vestibule.[6] "Multi-light windows" were added on the third through tenth floors, deviating from the plate glass windows typically used in retail buildings, which one critic said "added much to the appearance of the openings".[4] In addition to the main entrance, there were smaller side entrances on 38th and 39th Streets.[8]Travertine was used for the surface of the first floor.[9] Cork surfaces were incorporated into the selling counters to reduce strain on employees who leaned on the counters.[7] Wood was also used in the decorative features and on the fifth floor, where there was originally a carpet department.[4]The building was designed with several features that enabled the store to function efficiently. For instance, ramps led from 38th and 39th Streets to a receiving/delivery dock in the building's basement, obviating the need for delivery trucks to load and unload cargo on the street.[7][10] Additionally, the displays in the store's front windows were located on small elevators, which could be lowered into the basement whenever the displays had to be changed.[11][7][9] There were several conveyor systems and dumbwaiters that could move products from the basement to the shipping department or customers.[7][4] A packaging department was located on the eighth floor.[10]The above-ground floors were connected via 20 passenger elevators, seven staircases, and numerous freight elevators and conveyor systems.[4] Lord & Taylor was considered the first department store to have installed elevators, though it is unclear whether the Fifth Avenue flagship was the first Lord & Taylor store with elevators.[12][13] On the walls outside the passenger elevator landings on each floor, there were lighted arrows that indicated each elevator's direction of travel, at the time of the building's construction, this was still an uncommon feature.[14]There were no retail areas on the tenth floor, which instead contained a food court with restaurants that could collectively seat 500 people.[11][7][14] The dining areas were named after their theming: the Adam style Wedgewood Room, the Chinese-themed Mandarin Room, and the Italian villa-themed Loggia.[11][14] Other customer amenities included a concert hall within the seventh-floor music department, and restrooms, telephones, and travel counters on the fifth floor.[7] There was also a "manicure parlor for men" as well as a mechanical horse ride.[13] Employee amenities were also built into the design of the building. There was a gym, solarium, and dental and medical departments on the 11th floor,[11] while other floors contained dining rooms and a men's smoking area.[7] A plaque, commemorating 68 Lord & Taylor employees who died in wars, was hung on the wall just inside the entrance.[15]In 1826, English immigrant Samuel Lord founded the original Lord & Taylor store at 47 Catherine Street in what is now Two Bridges in Lower Manhattan.[16][17] The original Lord & Taylor moved several times,[16][18] opening new flagship stores at Broadway and Grand Street within SoHo in 1859,[16][17][18] and then at Broadway and 20th Street in the "Ladies' Mile" area in 1870.[17][18] After a period of economic decline and growth, the company opened stores along Fifth Avenue in 1903 and 1906, becoming one of the avenue's first retailers.[18]Meanwhile, the residential core of Manhattan relocated north from lower Manhattan during the late 19th century. Many stores established in the 1850s and 1860s were located along Broadway south of 14th Street, including the Grand Street flagship store of Lord & Taylor. By the 1870s, stores were being established between 14th and 23rd Streets in the Ladies' Mile area, including the Lord & Taylor Building at 901 Broadway.[3] At the beginning of the 20th century, development was centered on Fifth Avenue north of 34th Street, where new department store buildings were quickly replacing the street's brownstones.[3][19][20] The first of these was the B. Altman and Company Building, which opened in 1906.[21]Edward Hatch, a partner in Lord & Taylor, and his grandson Wilson Hatch Tucker decided to look for a new location for Lord & Taylor's headquarters in 1909.[16]: 43–44 [3] A site abutting the western sidewalk of Fifth Avenue, running from West 38th to 39th Streets, was leased from the Burton brothers in October 1912. The site measured 260 feet (79 m) on 38th Street by 200 feet (61 m) deep, but excluded a holdout lot at the site's northwest corner, at 39th Street.[3][22] Starrett & van Vleck were announced as the architects,[3] while the structure was erected by E. Brooks & Company Inc.[14] At the time, the store was planned to open at the beginning of 1914.[23] An old home on the site was torn down at the end of 1912,[24] and construction was well underway by the middle of the following year.[25]The Lord & Taylor Building opened on February 24, 1914,[26] and the Broadway store was sold a month later, on March 26.[27] The new building had cost more than estimated,[28] and Lord & Taylor announced in November 1915 that it would sell off its wholesale business because of a lack of funding.[29]Dorothy Shaver, a full-time employee at Lord & Taylor since 1924, became its president in 1945, making her the first woman in the United States to head a multimillion-dollar firm.[30] Under her tenure, the Lord & Taylor Building was expanded to include several specialty and clothing departments, and Lord & Taylor became the first U.S. department store to include such divisions.[28] The fourth floor was renovated to accommodate an older women's clothing department, reopening in March 1938.[31] That September, the renovated third floor opened to the public with divisions for dresses, millinery, and suits and coats. The third floor used colored furniture to contrast with gray walls, several mirrors for customers to quickly preview garments, and narrow entrances that drew customers' attention to the rear sections of the department, rather than to the items near the entrances. According to The New York Times, these additions were "deliberately violating several cardinal principles of store layout".[32] The redesign was planned by Raymond Loewy, who also designed the lamp and gift departments on the ninth floor, the girls' departments, the Men's Budget Shop, and the ground-floor stationery department.[33][34]The company expanded to its first branch location in 1941,[16]: 38  but the main building on Fifth Avenue continued to serve as Lord & Taylor's flagship store and headquarters.[28] In November 1938, an atypically warm month for the city, the company was involved in a dispute with the Fifth Avenue Association over a window display that did not display any merchandise, but instead depicted a blizzard with a sign stating "It's coming! Sooner or later!".[35] The display supposedly went against a ban on "cheap trinket shops",[11] and the company took down the displays[36] before later putting them back up.[11]In January 1976, it was announced that five of the building's floors, including the main floor, would be remodeled with mirrored glass on the columns and walls, as well as travertine sales counters.[37] The renovation was completed that September, at which point Lord & Taylor CEO Joseph E. Brooks announced that the branches would receive similar renovations.[38] Starting in 1979 during the Iran hostage crisis, the store played The Star-Spangled Banner (the U.S. national anthem) each morning before opening. The tradition was implemented because Lord & Taylor's chairman at the time wanted to send the message that the U.S. was "the greatest country in the world".[15] In 1986, Lord & Taylor's parent company signed a lease for the Dreicer Building, the "holdout" building at Fifth Avenue and 39th Street. The store was later expanded into the Dreicer Building.[7] New windows were added in 2003.[11]In 2006, Lord & Taylor was sold to Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.).[39][40] The building was made a New York City designated landmark on October 30, 2007.[1] Most of the floors were extensively remodeled in 2009–2010 after Hudson's Bay Company pledged to spend $150 million on upgrades.[41] The beauty level received brighter lighting and a new chandelier, and several windows that were previously located in storage rooms were incorporated into the publicly accessible space.[42]Plans to add a large skyscraper above the store were discussed in April 2017.[43] That October, it was reported the company planned to sell the Fifth Avenue flagship and headquarters as part of a joint venture with WeWork for a reported $850 million.[44][45][12] WeWork was set to occupy the uppermost floors of the building, with the rest of the building remaining a flagship space for Lord & Taylor.[46] Lord & Taylor shuttered in January 2019 for construction which was to begin in the next month.[47][15] Lord & Taylor's parent company subsequently subleased space at 275 Madison Avenue.[48][49] The building's sale to WeWork was officially finalized in February 2019.[50] As part of the final transaction WeWork converted $125 million of the purchase price into equity, forming the joint venture for the building's ownership.[51]In June 2019, technology company Amazon expressed interest in renting out almost the entire building from WeWork.[52][53] At the time, WeWork was spending $438 million to renovate the Lord & Taylor Building.[54] By that October, the Lord & Taylor Building had become a burden for WeWork. Controversies had led to the company's initial public offering being withdrawn the previous month, and WeWork had paid $105 per square foot ($1,130/m2) per square foot for the building, substantially more than the average price of $80 per square foot ($860/m2) for comparable office space in the area.[55] Amazon purchased the building in February 2020 for $978 million,[56] and the acquisition was finalized the following month.[57] That August, Amazon announced that up to 2,000 employees in the company's advertising, music, video, and fashion divisions would start working in the building in 2023.[58][59] These plans had been finalized before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in early 2020, which had caused an increase in remote work, but Amazon proceeded with the original plans.[60]Upon the building's completion, its design was lauded by Architecture magazine as a public "gift and a benefit".[11][7] In the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City, the Federal Writers' Project described the Lord & Taylor Building's construction as being "a break with tradition" and that "the avenue now had a building that was frankly commercial as well as dignified".[61] Upon the sale of the building in 2017, a New York Times reporter wrote that the move was "a story of the new economy cannibalizing the old".[13]"
First Cabinet of Waldemar Pawlak;"Waldemar Pawlak is the only person to serve twice as Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland during the Third Republic period (1989–present).[1]His first premiership (5 June – 7 July 1992) was the briefest Government during this period, lasted only 33 days.[1] This was, however, notable period, known commonly as Pawlak's 33 days (33 dni Pawlaka).[2]After the downfall of Jan Olszewski's cabinet, Pawlak, a leader of the agrarian Polish People's Party, was named new Prime Minister by President Lech Wałęsa with mission, to form a new coalition government included agrarians, Christian democrats and liberals.[2]However, Pawlak government failed to gain a support from Sejm majority and failed in a vote of confidence.  He resigned and President replaced him by Hanna Suchocka, who won support from the majority.Pawlak's first premiership and his role was and is widely viewed as caretaker administration, to give a new coalition time to form next government, after political disturbance after fall of the Olszewski government.[2]Because cabinet did not receive support from Sejm, at this time Pawlak had no official ministers, only temporary chiefs of executive branches.[3]Pawlak returned to Prime Minister office in 1993, this time as a head of the agrarian-socialists Polish People's Party-Democratic Left Alliance coalition. He served from 1993 to 1995."
Give Thanks (horse);"Give Thanks (13 April 1980 – December 1998) was a British-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After showing little ability as a juvenile she emerged as a leading performer over middle distances in 1983. She won six of her first seven races including the Lingfield Oaks Trial, Musidora Stakes, Lancashire Oaks and Irish Oaks. She was also placed in the Yorkshire Oaks, Park Hill Stakes and Gallinule Stakes and ended the year rated the best filly of her generation in Ireland. After her retirement from racing she had some success as a broodmare, being the dam of the Falmouth Stakes winner Alshakr, and the grand-dam of Harayir.Give Thanks was a "workmanlike"[2] bay mare with a small white star bred in England by Mrs M. P. Pitt. As a yearling in December she was put up for auction and was sold for 33,000 guineas.[3] She entered the ownership of Mrs Ogden White and was sent to Ireland where she was trained by Jim Bolger. She was ridden in most of her races by the Irish jockey Declan Gillespie.She was sired by Relko, the French-trained winner of the 1963 Epsom Derby. Relko was not a conspicuous success as a breeding stallion,[4] although he did sire Relkino, Olwyn, Lanfranco. Her dam Parthica showed some ability as a racehorse and was a daughter of the influential broodmare Violetta, whose other descendants have included  Sir Percy, Teenoso, Harayir, Rule of Law and Olympic Glory.[5]As a two-year-old in 1982 Give Thanks failed to win in three races. She finished unplaced in her first two races over seven furlongs and then finished third over one mile on her final appearance of the season.[3]On her first appearance as a three-year-old Give Thanks recorded her first success as she won a maiden race over ten furlongs on heavy ground at Navan Racecourse. She followed up by winning a race over nine furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse by three lengths. Although she had never been entered for The Oaks, the filly was then sent to England to contest two of the major trials for the race. In the Lingfield Oaks Trial over one and a half miles on 6 May she won by five lengths from the highly regarded British filly Cormorant Wood. Five days later she was dropped back in distance and started the 13/8 favourite for the Musidora Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. She produced an even better performance as she won by eight lengths from So True and New Coins, with the other three runners (including the Fillies' Mile winner Acclimatise) reportedly "strung out like washing". Later that month she was matched against male opposition in the Gallinule Stakes at the Curragh and finished second to the colt Carlingford Castle. Although there was some disappointment at the result (she had started 5/6 favourite), the form of the race looked much better after Carlingford Castle finished second to Teenoso in the 1983 Epsom Derby on 1 June.[3]Give Thanks was back in England in July for the Lancashire Oaks on good ground at Haydock Park an starte at 4/1 with the best of her twelve opponents looking to be Acclimatise, who had finished second to Sun Princess in the Epsom Oaks and Ski Sailing who had beaten Sun Princess at Newbury earlier in the season. In a slowly-run race. the Irish filly looked to be struggling when the pace quickened in the straight but got to the front a furlong out and drew away in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Ski Sailing. On 21 July, on her seventh run of the campaign, Give Thanks was moved up to Group 1 class for the first time to contest the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles on firm ground at the Curragh, and started the 7/4 favourite ahead of the British-trained challengers High Hawk (winner of the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot) and Shore Line (fourth in the Epsom Oaks). The best-fancied of the other nine runners were Safe Process, Bay Empress (third in the Pretty Polly Stakes) and Green Lucia. After tracking the pacemaker Hocus Pocus, Give Thanks took the lead entering the straight, accelerated clear of her rivals and stayed on to win by two and a half lengths from High Hawk with Green Lucia in third place.[3]The much-anticipated meeting between Give Thanks and the English champion Sun Princess took place in the Yorkshire Oaks on 16 August and the fillies started at 7/4 and 6/5 respectively in a six-runner field. In the event Give Thanks failed to show her best form and was beaten seven lengths into third place by Sun Princess and Green Lucia. She was then moved up in distance and started favourite for the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 7 September but was beaten three-uarters of a length by the improving High Hawk. The filly ended her season with a trip to the United States for the Washington, D.C. International at Laurel Park on 12 November. She finished fifth of the eight runners behind All Along, losing third place in a multiple photo-finish.[3]At the end of the 1983 season Give Thanks was retired from racing and was covered by the stallion Kings Lake in early 1984. She failed to conceive and was sent back into training later that year. On her return to the track in September at the Curragh she ran promisingly when taking third place behind Opale and Marble Run in the Meld Stakes. Later that month, on her only subsequent start she finished fifth behind the gelding Bedtime in the September Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse.[2]The level of Give Thanks' performances in 1982 were insufficient to earn her a place in the Irish Free Handicap.[6] In the official International Classification for 1983 she was rated on 82, nine pounds behind the top-rated three-year-old filly Habibti. She was the top-rated Irish three-year-old filly, alongside Flame of Tara. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 123, 13 pounds behind Habibti who was their Horse of the Year.[3] She was rated 106 by Timeform in 1984.[2]Give Thanks is honoured in the name of the Give Thanks Stakes, established in 2003 at Cork Racecourse.After the end of her racing career, Give Thanks became a broodmare for Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Stud. She produced eight foals and three winners between 1986 and 1995:Give Thanks died at Shadwell Stud in December 1998 at the age of 18.[10]"
St Mary Mead;"St Mary Mead is a fictional village created by popular crime fiction author Dame Agatha Christie.The quaint, sleepy village was home to the renowned detective spinster Miss Marple. However, Christie first described a village of that name prior to Marple's introduction, in the 1928 Hercule Poirot novel The Mystery of the Blue Train. In that novel, St Mary Mead is home to the book's protagonist Katherine Grey. The village was first mentioned in a Miss Marple book in 1930, when it was the setting for the first Marple novel, The Murder at the Vicarage.Miss Marple's St Mary Mead is described in The Murder at the Vicarage as being in the fictional county of Downshire, but in the later novel The Body in the Library Downshire has become Radfordshire. In the BBC Miss Marple TV adaptation of Nemesis, a letter from Mr Rafiel's solicitors indicate that St Mary Mead is located in the (also fictional) county of Middleshire. The St Mary Mead of Katherine Grey is in Kent.Miss Marple lives in Danemead Cottage, the last cottage in Old Pasture Lane. Her telephone number is "three five" on a manual exchange.[1]Once it has been fully established as Miss Marple's home village, St Mary Mead is supposed to be in South East England, 25 miles (40 kilometres) from London.[2] It is just outside the town of Much Benham and is close to Market Basing (which appears as a name of a town in many of Agatha Christie's novels and short stories), 12 miles (19 kilometres) from the fashionable seaside resort of Danemouth, and also 12 miles (19 kilometres) from the coastal town of Loomouth.[3] Other towns said to be close by include Brackhampton, Medenham Wells, and Milchester. The neighbourhood of St Mary Mead is served by trains arriving at Paddington railway station, indicating a location west or south-west of London. It has been suggested that Market Basing is Basingstoke and Danemouth is Bournemouth. In the BBC Miss Marple television adaptations the Hampshire village of Nether Wallop was used as the setting for St Mary Mead. Brackhampton could be Bracknell, just north of Basingstoke.Before the Second World War, the village itself was not particularly large. The only road of significance passing through it was the High Street. Here were the well-established purveyances of Mr Petherick, the solicitor, Mrs Jamieson, the hairdresser, Mr Thomas's basket-weavers, the 'Blue Boar' pub, Mr Footit the butcher, Mr Jim Armstrong's dairy, Mr Berks the baker, and Mr Baker's grocery shop. The little-trafficked railway station, featured in the book Murder at the Vicarage, is also to be found at the very end of the High Street, although the station may have closed by the period of the novel 4.50 from Paddington, as Mrs McGillicuddy has a taxi arranged for the 9 miles (14 kilometres) from Milchester station to Miss Marple's house.[4]Then, slightly further up Lansham Road, was the fine Victorian structure of Gossington Hall. Until the 1950s this was lived in by a pompous retired soldier, Colonel Arthur Bantry, and his wife Mrs Dolly Bantry, Miss Marple's best friends in the village. However, after Colonel Bantry died, Mrs Bantry sold the estate, but continued to live on in the grounds in the East Lodge. After one or two changes of ownership, the Hall was later bought by the film star Marina Gregg. One mile down Lansham Road was a very modern cottage called Chatsworth, also known as the "Period Piece" and "Mr Booker's new house". It was bought in the early 1930s by Basil Blake, a member of the art department at Lemville film studios. It was also inhabited by Basil's wife, Dinah Lee, an actress.At the other end of Lansham Road, a small lane called Old Pasture Lane broke away from the main street. Nestled in this lane were three Queen Anne or Georgian houses, which belonged to three spinsters. The first house belonged to the long-nosed, gushing and excitable Miss Caroline Wetherby. The second was Miss Amanda Hartnell, a proud, decent woman with a deep voice. The last cottage was called Danemead Cottage and belonged to Miss Jane Marple, the famous spinster who solved countless cases between 1930 and 1976. The Post Office, and the dressmaker's shop belonging to Mrs Politt, are located in front of the lane.The centre of the village was the Vicarage, a very grand Victorian structure at the end of the Lane. The Vicarage was home to the Vicar, Leonard Clement, his pretty young wife, Griselda, with their nephew, Dennis, and later with their two sons, Leonard and David.Near the gardens of the Vicarage was a back lane which led to a small cottage called Little Gates. Until 1930, it was inhabited by an Anglo-Indian colonel who moved away and briefly rented it out to Mrs Lestrange.Beyond the Vicarage were two more houses. The first was the residence of the village GP, Doctor Gerard Haydock. He continued to live on in the village beyond 1960. The other cottage was much larger than Dr Haydock's and belonged to Mrs Martha Price-Ridley, a rich and dictatorial widow, and the most vicious gossip of all the old ladies in the village. There was also a large estate, Old Hall, belonging to the despised local magistrate, Colonel Lucius Protheroe. He was murdered in 1930 in Mr Clement's study in the Vicarage. After his death, the house was turned into a block of flats, to the great disapproval of the villagers. The flats housed Mrs Carmichael, a rich and eccentric old lady who was bullied by her maid, the Larkins, two sisters by the name of Skinner, one of whom was a supposed hypochondriac, and a young married couple. A robbery was later committed by the Skinner sisters.Finally, just beyond the home of the dreaded Price-Ridley (as she is known by other villagers) was a small stream, leading to the fields of Farmer Giles. However, the Second World War took its toll on the village, and soon after the war Farmer Giles's fields were bought and tarmacked over, and a new housing estate was built upon it. This was referred to as 'The Development' by the villagers who survived the war. A large hospital was also built nearby, staffed by many doctors and nurses. As well as this, there were some very large hotels and three film studios: Lenville, Elstree and Hellingforth."

Estienne Roger;"Estienne Roger (1664 or 1665 in Caen, France – 7 July 1722 in Amsterdam) was a francophone printer, bookseller and publisher of sheet music working in the Netherlands.Roger was born a French Huguenot. The revocation of Edict of Nantes in 1685 made him flee with his family to the Netherlands where he settled in Amsterdam. In 1691 he married Marie-Suzanne de Magneville (c. 1671–1712), by that time his father had settled in England. He learned the trade of printing from Antoine Pointel and Jean-Louis de Lorme. In 1696 he opened his own shop in the Kalverstraat.[1]Roger concentrated on histories, grammars, dictionaries, and eventually became a renowned publisher of musical scores. Between 1696 and 1722 he published over 500 editions of music written by a wide range of composers. In some cases, Roger offered mere reprints aiming at the European market he successfully reached (works that had been published by Giuseppe Sala in Venice or Ballard in Paris). His own publications were reprinted especially by Pierre Mortier in Amsterdam and John Walsh in London. Apart from "serious" music, or "classical" as it would be termed today, he also published popular music, such as his volumes of Oude en Nieuwe Hollantse Boerenlietjes en Contradansen, published 1700-1716.[2]In 1711 he published Vivaldi's Opus 3 L'estro armonico, a collection of 12 concerti for one, two, and four violins with strings.[3]  In 1714 he posthumously published Arcangelo Corelli's Concerti Grossi with a secondary title page engraved by Gilliam van der Gouwen after a design by the Italian painter Francesco Trevisani.[4]Roger was famous for the taste and the diligence of his work and for his ability to sell large editions he would advertise in Western Europe. Trade connections to Rotterdam, Brussels, Liege, Paris, Cologne, Leipzig, Halle (Saale), Berlin, Hamburg and London ensured international outreach. His command of the European market was striking, with publication histories such as the one he could grant Constantin de Renneville's French Inquisition. The edition he sold in 1715 was reprinted in London and Nuremberg that very year, proof that his copies had reached readers in both cities within weeks.[citation needed]In 1716 Roger's daughter Françoise (1694–1723) had married the printer Michel-Charles Le Cène, his father Charles Le Cène was a renowned Huguenot minister, who worked in the shop until 1720, the date he opened his own business. Roger's second daughter Jeanne (1701–1722) was his official heiress when Roger died on 7 July 1722. She had acted as publisher a few times before 1722. She died only five months after her father.[citation needed]Instead of passing the shop into the hands of her sister Françoise and her husband Le Cène, Jeanne had left it to Gerrit Drinkman, a company employee who in turn died only a few months later. Le Cène finally acquired the shop and continued its main business of music publishing until his death in 1743 with more than 100 new publications. The inventory was then purchased by the bookseller Emanuel-Jean de la Coste (fl. 1743-1746), who soon thereafter published a full catalog entitled "the books of music, printed at Amsterdam, by Estienne Roger and Michel-Charles Le Cène,". De la Coste did not continue the printing business.[5] In 1746 he sold the business to Antoine Chareau, who had previously worked for Le Cène.[5] The shop ultimately ceased operation in 1748."
Triangle strip;"In computer graphics, a triangle strip is a subset of triangles in a triangle mesh with shared vertices, and is a more memory-efficient method of storing information about the mesh. They are more efficient than un-indexed lists of triangles, but usually equally fast or slower than indexed triangle lists.[1][2] The primary reason to use triangle strips is to reduce the amount of data needed to create a series of triangles. The number of vertices stored in memory is reduced from 3N to N + 2, where N is the number of triangles to be drawn.  This allows for less use of disk space, as well as making them faster to load into RAM.For example, the four triangles in the diagram, without using triangle strips, would have to be stored and interpreted as four separate triangles: ABC, CBD, CDE, and EDF. However, using a triangle strip, they can be stored simply as a sequence of vertices ABCDEF. This sequence  would be decoded as a set of triangles with vertices at ABC, BCD, CDE and DEF - although the exact order that the vertices are read will not be in left-to-right order as this would result in adjacent triangles facing alternating directions.OpenGL has built-in support for triangle strips. Fixed function OpenGL (deprecated in OpenGL 3.0) has support for triangle strips using immediate mode and the glBegin(), glVertex*(), and glEnd() functions. Newer versions support triangle strips using glDrawElements and glDrawArrays.To draw a triangle strip using immediate mode OpenGL, glBegin() must be passed the argument GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, which notifies OpenGL a triangle strip is about to be drawn. The glVertex*() family of functions specify the coordinates for each vertex in the triangle strip. For more information, consult The OpenGL Redbook.[3]To draw the triangle strip in the diagram using immediate mode OpenGL, the code is as follows:Note that only one additional vertex is needed to draw the second triangle.In OpenGL, the order in which the vertices are specified is important so that surface normals are consistent.Quoting directly from the OpenGL Programming Guide:GL_TRIANGLE_STRIPDraws a series of triangles (three-sided polygons) using vertices v0, v1, v2, then v2, v1, v3 (note the order), then v2, v3, v4, and so on. The ordering is to ensure that the triangles are all drawn with the same orientation so that the strip can correctly form part of a surface.It's even clearer within the manual pages:[4]Draws a connected group of triangles.  One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first two vertices. For odd n, vertices n, n + 1, and n + 2 define triangle n. For even n, vertices n + 1, n, and n + 2 define triangle n. n – 2 triangles are drawn.Note that n starts at 1. The above code sample and diagram demonstrate triangles drawn in a clockwise orientation.  For those to be considered front-facing, a preceding call to glFrontFace(GL_CW) is necessary, which otherwise has an initial value of GL_CCW (meaning that triangles drawn counter-clockwise are front-facing by default).[5]  This is significant if glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE) and glCullFace(GL_BACK) are already active (GL_BACK by default[6]), because back-facing triangles will be culled, so will not be drawn and will not appear on-screen at all.[7]It follows from definition that a subsequence of vertices of a triangle strip also represents a triangle strip. However, if this substrip starts at an even (with 1-based counting) vertex, then the resulting triangles will change their orientation. For example a substrip BCDEF would represent triangles: BCD,CED,DEF.Similarly, reversal of strips’ vertices will result in the same set of triangles if the strip has an even number of vertices. (e.g. strip FEDCBA will represent the same triangles FED,ECD,DCB,CAB as the original strip). However, if a strip has an odd number of vertices then the reversed strip will represent triangles with opposite orientation. For example, reversal of a strip ABCDE will result in strip EDCBA which represents triangles EDC, DBC, CBA).Converting a general polygon mesh to a single long strip was until recently generally not possible. Usually the triangle strips are analogous to a set of edge loops, and poles on the model are represented by triangle fans. Tools such as Stripe[8] or FTSG[9] represent the model as several strips. Optimally grouping a set of triangles into sequential strips has been proven NP-complete.[10]Alternatively, a complete object can be described as a degenerate strip, which contains zero-area triangles that the processing software or hardware will discard. The degenerate triangles effectively introduce discontinuities or "jumps" to the strip. For example, the mesh in the diagram could also be represented as ABCDDFFEDC, which would be interpreted as triangles ABC CBD CDD DDF DFF FFE FED DEC (degenerate triangles marked with italics). Notice how this strip first builds two triangles from the left, then restarts and builds the remaining two from the right.While discontinuities in triangle strips can always be implemented by resending vertices, APIs sometimes explicitly support this feature. IRIS GL supported Swaps (flipping two subsequent vertices in a strip), a feature relied on by early algorithms such as the SGI algorithm. Recently OpenGL/DirectX can render multiple triangle strips without degenerated triangles using Primitive Restart feature."
John Ford (diplomat);"Sir John Archibald Ford, KCMG, MC (19 February 1922 – 16 January 2018) was a British diplomat. He served as British Ambassador to Indonesia from 1975 to 1978 and British High Commissioner to Canada from 1978 to 1981.Ford was born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, the son of Ronald Mylne Ford, a solicitor, and Margaret Jesse Coghill. He was educated at College of St Michael and All Angels, Tenbury and Sedbergh School, before being called up for military service in 1941 He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery and was awarded the Military Cross in 1945 for “sustained gallantry, skill and devotion to duty, showing initiative and resource of the highest order” during the battle for Kervenheim in Germany. After the conclusion of the war in Europe, he was posted to Java, Dutch East Indies.After being demobilized as a temporary Major, Ford went up to Oriel College, Oxford, where he read French and German. He then joined the Foreign Service (later the Diplomatic Service), and was posted to Budapest as a third secretary."
A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice;"A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice is a multi-volume collection of Scottish song edited and published by the entrepreneurial musician, publisher and Clerk to the Board of Trustees for Encouragement of Art and Manufacture in Scotland, George Thomson. For the first volume, which appeared in 1793, Thomson commissioned the composer Ignaz Pleyel to provide musical settings. He subsequently expanded his scheme throughout his life in further volumes and editions.Between 1792 and his death in 1796, the poet Robert Burns contributed (for little or no remuneration) over 100 songs to the work, including hallmark productions such as 'My Luve is like a Red Red Rose' and 'Is There for Honest Poverty'. Other 'librettists' in the original first volume include Allan Ramsay, Peter Pindar, Andrew Erskine, Earl Kellie, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, as well as traditional song.The first 'set' of the first volume of Original Scottish Airs begins with the song 'The Smiling Morn' (more commonly known as 'The Birks of Invermay'), a known favourite of the poet Robert Fergusson.The title page of the first 1793 edition runs: A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice. To each of which are added Introductory & Concluding Symphonies & Accompanyments for the Violin & Piano Forte, by Pleyel. With Select & Characteristic Verses by the most admired Scottish Poets adapted to each Air, many of them entirely new. Also Suitable English Verses in addition to such of the Songs as are written in the Scottish dialect.George Thomson continued to develop further editions of Scottish Airs throughout his life and, following its success, extend the principles he established to make similar gatherings of other national airs, commissioning European composers as disparate as Kozeluch, Haydn, Beethoven, Weber, Hummel and Bishop in the process. Thomson ultimately issued three separate folio collections: Scottish (6 volumes, 1793-1841), Welsh (3 volumes, 1809-1814), and Irish (2 volumes, 1814-1816)."
Codorus Township, York County, Pennsylvania;"Codorus Township is a township in York County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,898 at the 2020 census.[2]The S. B. Brodbeck Housing was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.[4]According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 33.5 square miles (87 km2), all of it land. The township nearly encircles the borough of Jefferson, along the township's northern border.At the 2000 census there were 3,646 people, 1,344 households, and 1,099 families living in the township.  The population density was 108.9 people per square mile (42.0/km2).  There were 1,398 housing units at an average density of 41.8/sq mi (16.1/km2).  The racial makeup of the township was 98.30% White, 0.08% African American, 0.44% Native American, 0.25% Asian, 0.25% from other races, and 0.69% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.22%.[5]Of the 1,344 households 31.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.4% were married couples living together, 5.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.2% were non-families. 15.6% of households were one person and 6.9% were one person aged 65 or older.  The average household size was 2.71 and the average family size was 2.99.The age distribution was 23.6% under the age of 18, 6.8% from 18 to 24, 27.3% from 25 to 44, 29.9% from 45 to 64, and 12.3% 65 or older.

HMS K2;"HMS K2 was the second of the K class submarines and was built at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth, England. She was laid down on 13 November 1915 and was commissioned in May 1917 one year before the end of World War I. In January 1917, K2 was damaged by an explosion and fire during her first diving trials. On 11 January 1924, it collided with K12 as they departed Portland Harbour. K2 smashed a hole in the forward casing of K12 and buckled her bows for about 6 feet (1.8 m).On 7 November 1924, K2 collided with H29 during exercises. K2 was sold on 13 July 1926 to John Cashmore Ltd for scrapping at Newport.Like all British K-class submarines, K2 had a displacement of 1,800 tonnes (2,000 short tons) when at the surface and 2,600 tonnes (2,900 short tons) while submerged.[1] It had a total length of 338 feet (103 m), a beam of 26 feet 6 inches (8.08 m), and a draught of 20 feet 11 inches (6.38 m).[2] The submarine was powered by two oil-fired Yarrow Shipbuilders boilers and one geared Brown-Curtis or Parsons steam turbine, this developed 10,500 ship horsepower (7,800 kW) to drive two 7 feet 6 inches (2.29 m) screws. It also contained four electric motors each producing 350 to 360 horsepower (260 to 270 kW).[2][3] It was also fitted with a diesel engine providing 800 horsepower (600 kW) to be used when steam was being generated.[4]The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 24 knots (44 km/h, 28 mph) and a submerged speed of 9 to 9.5 knots (16.7 to 17.6 km/h, 10.4 to 10.9 mph).[2][5] It could operate at depths of 150 feet (46 m) at 2 knots (3.7 km/h, 2.3 mph) for 80 nautical miles (150 km, 92 mi).[1] K2 was fitted with a 3 inches (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun, ten 18 inches (460 mm) torpedo tubes, and two 4 inches (100 mm) deck guns.[2] Its torpedo tubes were fitted to the bows, the midship section, and two were mounted on the deck.[1] Its complement was fifty-nine crew members.[5]"

Julia (comics);"Julia-le avventure di una criminologa (Italian: Julia, adventures of a criminologist), known simply as Julia, is an Italian comic book series created by Giancarlo Berardi and edited by Sergio Bonelli Editore.The protagonist, Julia Kendall, is a criminologist, and the stories are usually in the crime fiction genre.The comic series was created in 1998 by Berardi (already author of Ken Parker)[1] and it was born of Sergio Bonelli Editore's wish for a purely detective series,[2] as well as by request of Ken Parker's fans, after its end, for a new comic.Berardi has attended criminology classes at Genoa's Istituto di Medicina Legale (Institute of Legal Medicine) to better prepare the new series. He also read various texts about psychology, sociology, psychiatry, criminology, ballistics, crime news articles, as well as crime novels, films and documentaries.[3]Julia Kendall's character is physically inspired by Audrey Hepburn, one of Berardi's favorite actresses.[3] Choosing a female protagonist -an ordinary, easily relatable woman- had the series have a large following of woman readers,[2] unusual for a crime fiction comic.Issues of Julia have 128 pages instead of the usual 96 pages of Sergio Bonelli's comic series. Berardi has justified it saying that a bigger number of pages is better to develop the characters and manage the narrative's pace.[3]The first album in the series, titled Gli occhi del abisso (The Eyes of the Abyss) was published in October 1998. On January 3, 2007, Julia reached the 100th issue with a fully colored album.)[4]The series tell the stories of Julia Kendall, a young criminologist from the fictional Garden City in New Jersey. She works as a professor at Hollyhock University and as a freelance consultant to the local police, helping them to solve crimes.The cases Julia deals with put her in extremely dangerous situations, as her skills in psychology and her relations with Garden City Police Department lead her on the trail of vicious serial killers (above all the ruthless Myrna Harrod, a recurring character in the series) and unscrupulous criminals. Other cases involve her in classic whodunnit scenarios.Alongside her in their investigations are the surly lieutenant Alan Webb and the friendly sergeant "Big" Ben Irving, as well as his friend and private investigator Leo Baxter.Characteristic of the series is the extensive use of Julia's diary, where the protagonist writes her thoughts and impressions about the cases, working as a first-person narration. In some albums, the storytelling is done by other characters in the series (like Myrna Harrod or sergeant Irving)."
George Monckton-Arundell, 7th Viscount Galway;"George Edmund Milnes Monckton-Arundell, 7th Viscount Galway, CB (18 November 1844 – 7 March 1931) was a British Conservative politician and courtier.Galway was the son of George Monckton-Arundell, 6th Viscount Galway, and his wife and first cousin Henrietta Maria, daughter of Robert Pemberton Milnes and sister of Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He entered Parliament for Nottinghamshire North in an 1872 by-election, a seat he held until 1885 when the constituency was abolished. He succeeded his father in the viscountcy in 1876 but as this was an Irish peerage he did not have to resign his seat in the House of Commons. On 4 July 1887 Galway was created Baron Monckton, of Serlby in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom,[1] which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords.

La Caravana del manuscrito andalusí;"La Caravana del manuscrito andalusí is a 2007 documentary film directed by Lidia Peralta García.[1]During the 12th and 15th centuries, in Muslim Spain, many science books were written. When Muslims left Spain, many took their manuscripts with them. Today, one can find them spread in particular libraries, all along the caravan route through Morocco, Mauritania and Mali. From Toledo to Timbuktu, this documentary follows their traces. Its protagonist, Ismael Diadié Haidara, owner of the Andalus Library of Timbuktu, has spent years trying to retrieve his family's manuscripts and with them, his own Al Andalus past.[2][3]The film was produced with the assistance of CEDECOM Malaga.The director, Lidia Peralta García, traveled for five months and covered over 6,000 kilometres (3,700 mi) on the route from Toledo in Spain to Timbuktu in Mali to make the documentary.According to Peralta, "a documentary like this makes you very aware that for many centuries we have shared the same history, while today some have white skin and others black".[4]La Caravana del manuscrito andalusí won the Best Documentary Film prize at the 10th International Panorama of Independent Films.[5]It was also nominated for Best Documentary Film at the 2008 Marbella International Film Festival.[6]This article related to a Spanish film of the 2000s is a stub.

SET 2;"The SET 2 or Proto-SET 2 was a 1920s Romanian prototype reconnaissance and day-bomber aircraft.The SET 2, Lieutenant-Colonel Stefan Protopopescu's design for a reconnaissance and bomber aircraft, owed a good deal to the Astra-Protopopescu reconnaissance machine that he designed about two years earlier.[1] A contraction of his name to Proto often appeared in variations of the new type's name.  This was more powerful, over 25% greater in span and differed in many details, but shared the same layout and some features like the tail and the wing bracing were very similar.[1][2]  It was a wood-framed aircraft and only used locally resourced timber.[1]The SET 2 was a single bay biplane with fabric covered, two spar wings of equal span and rectangular plan, though the corners were blunted.  Mounted with almost no stagger (a horizontal displacement of just 80 mm (3.1 in)), the wings were braced together by a pair of vertical interplane struts on each side, assisted by bracing wires.  The lower wings, which unlike the upper one carried considerable dihedral, were attached to the lower fuselage longerons and the upper one was held high above the fuselage by two parallel sets of transverse W-form cabane struts. Ailerons, which reached the wing tips, were placed on the upper wing alone.[1]It had a nose-mounted, 340 kW (450 hp)  Lorraine 12E Courlis W-12 engine water-cooled with a honeycomb radiator and a Lamblin oil cooler on the fuselage underside.  The forward fuselage was ash framed, changing to pine aft. In the engine area it was covered with aluminium, the central part was fabric covered and the rear plywood skinned.  The upper fuselage had a light, rounded  wooden decking.  There were two, tandem, open cockpits close to each other, with the forward one, from which it was flown, between the trailing edges. The upper edge had a rounded, almost semicircular cut out to improve the pilot's upward view and the lower edges had quadrantal cut-outs at the roots for downward vision. The rear cockpit had provision for a machine gun mounting. The fuselage tapered aft to conventional, unbalanced tail surfaces with a continuously curved tailplane and elevators positioned near the top of the fuselage.  The fin and rudder were also smoothly curved together, the latter extended to the keel and worked in a rounded elevator cut-out.[1]The SET 2 had a conventional, fixed tailskid undercarriage.  A short V-form strut was attached to each lower fuselage longeron, joined by a cross-piece at their apexes, above which a single axle bearing the main wheels was rubber sprung. The wooden tailskid was also rubber sprung.[1]The exact date of the SET 2's first flight is not known but the 2 February 1927 Les Ailes article notes that it had started tests "recently".[1] The number built apart from the prototype is also uncertain but here is no known record of production or service. Despite promising early test results, development of the SET-2 was abandoned after an in-flight fire and forced landing during flight-testing.[3]Data from Les Ailes February 1927,[1] Romanian Aeronautical Constructions 1905 - 1974[3]General characteristicsPerformance"
Bruno Ngotty;"Bruno Ngotty (born 10 June 1971) is a French former professional footballer. He played as a centre-back from 1988 until 2008, however he came out of retirement briefly in 2011.As well as his native country he has played in the top flight divisions in both Italy and England. He has notably played for Olympique Lyonnais, Paris Saint Germain, A.C. Milan, Olympique Marseille and Bolton Wanderers as well as earning six caps for France. He has also played for Venezia, Birmingham City, Leicester City and Hereford United. He came out of retirement to join French 6th tier side l'AS Lattes in 2011.Ngotty was born in Lyon.[5]Ngotty started his career with Olympique Lyonnais from the opening of the 1988–89 season to the close of the 1994–95 season. Ngotty managed to play 143 league games scoring 10 goals during his time at Lyon.[citation needed]Bruno Ngotty scored the winning goal which defeated Austrian club Rapid Wien in the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, giving Paris Saint-Germain their only cup triumph in the tournament. He was also included in the squad that reached the final again the next year, losing to Barcelona 1–0 at Feyenoord Stadion.[citation needed]Ngotty was part of the A.C. Milan team that won the Serie A title in 1999, making 25 league appearances for the club. He played alongside the likes of Paolo Maldini during his time there. He was sent on loan to Venezia during 1999 where he played 16 matches.[citation needed]After his relatively short spell at Milan he returned to France with Olympique Marseille. This turned out to be an even shorter spell than his stay in Milan which lasted for one season. He managed to play in 31 games during his only season at the club.[citation needed]Ngotty originally rejected Bolton Wanderers' loan offer, but later agreed to spend the rest of the season with the club. The move eventually became a permanent deal. He made his Bolton debut against Blackburn Rovers, in a match which finished in a 1–1 draw, on 19 September 2001. He scored his debut goal for the club seven months later, his only goal of the season coming in a 3–1 defeat at Everton.[6][7]In January 2002, this move became permanent, Ngotty being cited as one of the prime chances for Bolton success. His first full season for the club started in unfortunate style, as he received two yellow cards and one red card in his first six games. After this rather disappointing start he became a regular part of the first team and was voted supporters player of the year for the 2005 season. He originally wanted to end his career at the Reebok Stadium,[8] but with manager Sam Allardyce wanting to reduce the average age of the squad, Ngotty was released at the end of his contract in May 2006.[citation needed]Ngotty was signed by Birmingham City on a one-year deal on 6 July. The team achieved promotion to the Premier League that same season, finishing as runners up. He decided not to take up the option of another year at Birmingham. He scored two goals during his stay at Birmingham, against QPR in the league[9] and Newcastle in the FA Cup.[10]On 4 June 2007, Ngotty moved to Leicester City on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract.[11] Chairman Milan Mandarić revealed on 27 September that Ngotty was signed by him, and not then-manager Martin Allen, during a face-to-face meeting with the club's fans.[12] Ngotty was named in the Championship Team of the Week following the club's 1–1 draw against Stoke City on 29 September, together with teammate Márton Fülöp.[13] He played his 500th competitive game in an M69 Derby on 12 January 2008, in which Leicester won 2–0.[14] Ngotty played a total of 38 league games as Leicester were relegated from the Championship.[15]When Nigel Pearson replaced Ian Holloway as the club's new manager, Ngotty played in only one pre-season game and was neither in the squad's tour of Slovenia nor the opening match of the season. On 25 September 2008, Ngotty joined Hereford United on loan for a month.[16] Making his debut in Hereford's 1–0 defeat to Leeds United.[17] The loan was extended for a further month on 25 October.[18] However it was cut short after Ngotty suffered a serious injury in a match against Peterborough United, leaving the field after nine minutes with a suspected ruptured Achilles.[19] On 29 May 2009, Ngotty was released at the end of his contract.[20]In January 2011, Ngotty joined French 6th-tier side l'AS Lattes.[21]Ngorry was born in France and is of Cameroonian descent.[22] Though many observers predicted that Ngotty's international career was to be successful, he made only six appearances with Les Bleus, making his debut on 17 August 1994 against the Czech Republic alongside Zinedine Zidane and Lilian Thuram, but while the two were soon able to secure their places in the national team, Ngotty failed to impress Aimé Jacquet and played only five more matches until 1997, never being called up for a major event.[citation needed]Paris Saint-GermainA.C.

Loiyangalani;"Loiyangalani is a small town located on the southeastern coast of Lake Turkana in Kenya.[1] The town has a population of 5,117.[2] Loiyangalani means "a place of many trees" in the native Samburu tongue.  It is home to Turkana people and was founded near a freshwater spring in the 1960s where the El Molo people live. Its main industries include fishing, tourism and gold panning. It is a popular tourist destination in Northern Kenya, as the surrounding El Molo and Turkana villages offer unique (although somewhat commercialized) experiences.In June 2008, the 1st Cultural Festival took place at Loiyangalani and united all tribes of the Lake in celebration for one weekend.[3]The town is home to an airstrip and lies near Mount Kulal (50 km), known for its forest and stones. There are a few Lodges in the area, the "Oasis Lodge", the "Palmshade Camp", the "Mosaretu Women's Groupe Lodge", and the "Sailo Bandas" all located only a few hundred meters from the airstrip.Loiyangalani Division of Marsabit County is headquartered in Loiyangalani town. The town is sometimes spelled as Loyangalani.Loiyangalani was the setting for John le Carré's novel The Constant Gardener, and was also a location for the film of the same title. In 2010, Loiyangalani was briefly made a district on its own from the former Laisamis district by the President of Kenya, Mwai Kibaki."

Church of St Mary, Wanstrow;"The Anglican Church Of St Mary in Wanstrow, within the English county of Somerset, was built in the 15th century. It is a Grade II* listed building.[1][2]The church was extended and partially rebuilt in the 19th century. The three stage tower, which was added in 1810, is supported by corner buttresses.[1]The parish is part of the Postlebury benefice which includes the churches in Cloford, Marston Bigot, Nunney, Wanstrow and Witham Friary within the Diocese of Bath and Wells.[3]"
Jean-Joseph Kapeller;"Jean-Joseph Kapeller (24 July 1706 – 29 November 1790) was a French painter, architect and geometer.[1] Born in Marseille he was influenced by Jean-Baptiste de La Rose and Joseph Vernet, mainly producing landscapes and seascapes such as his 1756 masterwork Embarcation of the Expeditionary Corps for Minorca at the Port of Marseille under the command of the Duke of Richelieu. He and his contemporary Charles François Lacroix de Marseille produced seascapes which marked a step-change in the appreciation of seascapes in Provence in the second half of the 18th century.[2]Kapeller and Michel-François Dandré-Bardon co-founded Marseille's Académie de peinture et de sculpture, with Kapeller becoming its director-rector in 1771 and giving classes in drawing and gemotery there which were attended by his main pupil Henry d'Arles. Kapeller was also a major figure in freemasonry in the city, becoming grand master of the Chevaliers de l'Orient lodge. He also became rector of the third order Franciscans at the Récollets in 1745 and a member of a chapel of penitents. Famous in Marseille in his own time, he seems to have never become much known outside Provence and most of his works are now lost, though some now hang in public collections in Toulon and Marseille. His father Jean-Georges had been born in Meilen, Zurich and married Marie-Anne Daignan in Marseille on 11 January 1701, the year before Jean-Joseph's birth.[A 1] Jean-Georges was also a painter and seems to have been highly regarded by contemporary art critics, who referred to "the ardour of his zeal for everything which concerned the school, artists and matters of art".[3] Jean-Georges died before 1723, possibly during the bout of plague which affected Marseille in 1723, according to Joseph Billioud.Jean-Joseph Kapeller married Anne-Marie Mouren on 24 January 1723 in the collegiate church of Saint-Martin.[A 2] The couple had two children, Marie-Eugénie (called "widow Mullard" in Jean-Joseph's will of 1778[A 3]) and Pierre-Paul (a painter and teacher who was made an associate of the Académie in 1753 and settled in the Spanish colonies in South America, specialising in still lives of shellfish[4] and exhibiting at the Académie de peinture in 1757).Kapeller's knowledge of architecture caused the Académie's permanent director Dandré-Bardon to make him its permanent professor of geometry, teaching classes which comprised "elementary geometry, transcendental geometery and sublime geometry which applied differential calculus, principally integral calculus to the knowledge of curves and surfaces".[5] These classes were compulsory for all the Académie's pupils, including the future seascape painter Antoine Roux (1765 - 1835), since such knowledge was just as necessary to painters and sculptors as to astronomers and architects. These classes constituted an initial training in the field, which Kapeller also running a secondary course in the orders of architecture. Only after taking these preparatory classes could pupils move on to drawing the head and ornamentation.Kapeller was lastly professor of "mechanics" (what is now known as orthography) according to the terms in the Académie's lists.[6] The previous years' issues of the Almanach historique de Marseille by Grosson showed that Kappeler already ran a "school of mathematics, drawing and of civilian and military architecture" in his home on rue d'Aubagne.[A 4]According to professor Régis Bertrand, Kapeller seems to have retained his roles at the Académie until 1787 : an octogenarian, he was thus replaced by architect Jacques Dageville (1723–1794).[A 5]In Marseille he combined his roles at the Académie with that of police commissioner (a purely honorary and unpaid role) for 16 years.[7]"
Westmount Subdivision;" Westmount Subdivision is a neighbourhood in Halifax Regional Municipality.In 1931 the Halifax Municipal Airport was built on the site of the future neighbourhood. Pan American Airways operated at the airport, running a route between Halifax and Boston until the outbreak of World War II when the airport was closed and operations shifted to Naval Air Station Halifax (Shearwater). During the war, military supplies were stored on the field.After World War II, the federal government turned over the land to the then City of Halifax. In March, 1948 construction began on Westmount Subdivision. A total of 305 detached units were built using just 4 house designs.[1] The first chance given to buy the homes were to World War II veterans.It has an unusual design inspired by New Jersey's Radburn, of which a local newspaper said, "service streets wind along the rear lot lines and all houses will face on spacious park strips where children can play in safety, far removed from traffic lanes."[2][3]Saunders Park was created from part of the former airport land, named after Wing Commander Donald W. Saunders who was a pioneer in the development of aviation in Halifax.Coordinates: 44°38′48.86″N 63°36′33.69″W﻿ / ﻿44.6469056°N 63.6093583°W﻿ / 44.6469056, -63.6093583This Halifax County, Nova Scotia location article is a stub.

Francisco Monterde;"Francisco de Asís Monterde García Icazbalceta (August 9, 1894 in Mexico City – February 27, 1985 in Mexico City) was a prolific and multifaceted Mexican writer whose career spanned over fifty years. He was an important promoter of the arts and culture in Mexico in the years following the Revolution.His parents were Francisco de Asís Ángel María Monterde y Adalid and María Trinidad de los Dolores García Icazbalceta y Travesi de Monterde, aristocrats who both died when he was still young.[1] He studied  dentistry but never practiced. In 1924 he founded and edited the short-lived Mexican avant-garde cultural magazine Antena. In 1925 he famously deciphered a letter that conquistador Hernán Cortés left written in code. He wrote, in addition to plays and poetry, various novels set in colonial Mexico, a genre known as colonialista. In 1930 he created in conjunction with Alejandro Gómez Arias, the department of Mexican and Hispano-American Literature at the National Preparatory School. He was a founding member in 1938 of the Asociación Mexicana de Críticos de Teatro (AMCT). He belonged to the "grupo de los siete autores" (group of seven authors), a circle of dramatists active in the 1950s who revived the theatrical arts in Mexico. He was an admirer of José Juan Tablada and an imitator of the latter's haiku-inspired poetry (a style at the time referred to as haikai). He held important posts in the Ministry of Public Education. He was from 1922-65  a professor of Spanish and Latin-American literature at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), his alma mater (M.A. 1941, Ph.D. 1942). He served as subdirector of the Biblioteca Nacional de México, as head librarian of the Museo Nacional de Antropología e Historia (1931), and as director of the Imprenta Universitaria de la UNAM (UNAM University Press). He was director of the Centro Mexicano de Escritores from 1973-85.Monterde was a numerary member (seat 2) of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua and served as its director from 1960-72.(list not comprehensive)"
Broderick Park;"Broderick Park is a park situated along the Niagara River in Buffalo, New York, United States.Broderick Park, following an elongated shape, is located on the southern tip of Unity Island between the Niagara River and the Black Rock Canal. The park overlooks the Canada–US border and is situated within view of the Peace Bridge, which links the State of New York with the Canadian Province of Ontario at Fort Erie.Broderick Park offers recreational facilities for local residents and visitors. Under the Buffalo Micro Parks system within the City of Buffalo, contribution is made toward the maintenance and improvement of amenities.[3]Given the park's proximity to Canada, it is historically important in that it served as a transit area for African-Americans heading for the border on the opposite side of the Niagara River from the park. The park occupies an area that once housed docks for the Black Rock Ferry, which is known to have transported fugitive slaves to Canada as part of the Underground Railroad.[4][5]These activities were particularly precipitated by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which to some measure brought about the 'nationalizing' of some of the consequences of the slavery practiced in the Southern states, and hence the increased flow of African-Americans travelers seeking liberty in Canada. Ironically it was Buffalo's own Millard Fillmore who, as President of the United States, signed this measure into law. (See also: Millard Fillmore - Policies.)After the American Civil War period and the Emancipation Proclamation, the Park ceased to have the same clandestine focus for traveling African-Americans.Reenactments and commemorations of Underground Railroad events have been regularly held at Broderick Park under the sponsorship of Buffalo Quarters Historical Society.[6] In 2010, Broderick Park was recognized by the U.S. National Park Service as a National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom site.[5][7]Broderick Park — visibly close to the Peace Bridge — has sometimes been used as a backdrop to public meetings on subjects of law and administrative reform as they may relate to cross-border issues.[8]In 2008, funding shortfalls led to an unsuccessful proposal calling for Broderick Park to be transferred from the City of Buffalo to the State of New York, to become part of a future state park.[9]In 2012, plans were announced for a $1.5 million revitalization of the park, with plans for a new amphitheater, improved facilities, and a new memorial celebrating the park's involvement in the Underground Railroad.[10] The project commenced in 2013.[2]"

It has population of 1896 as per 2011 Census.[3] It has its own local administration under Panchayati Raj system, with Gram Pradhan as head of local administration. Since the very beginning this village has been an important center of education and cultural activities.[4]In 1541 ce, when Sultan Sher Shah Suri was ruling the country after defeating the Moghul emperor Nasir ud-din Muhammad Humayun in the battle of Chausa, the foundation of village KHAIRA DEEH was laid down by Babu Madhav Rai, elder son of Kunwar Narayan Shah of Kuresar-Naraianpur branch of Mulhan Dikshit family.[5]Khardiha belongs to Tallukedar Babu Madhav Rai's family. In sixth generation of Babu Madhav Rai's descendant elder brother Babu Ugrasen Rai got the zamindari of  Kundesar and younger brother Babu Vikram Rai moved to 'Kharhiyan'. In spite of being a small village compared to the nearby Joga Musahib, Awathahi, Gondaur, Kanuaan, Amarupur and Siyadeeh, Khardiha is considered an important place by neighbouring villages.[6]Before 1995 Kardiha had Musardeva, Shahpura, Gyanpur, Lalapur, Alapur and Navpura village under its panchayat. But now only one village comes under Khardiha panchayat. Khardiha gram sabha had people from every social strata as its Pradhan.

Parenting plan;"A parenting plan is a child custody plan that is negotiated by parents, and which may be included in a marital separation agreement or final decree of divorce.[1][2] Especially when a separation is acrimonious to begin with, specific agreements about who will discharge these responsibilities and when and how they are to be discharged can reduce the need for litigation. Avoiding litigation spares parties not only the financial and emotional costs of litigation but the uncertainty of how favorable or unfavorable a court's after-the-fact decision will be.[3]  Moreover, the agreement itself can authorize the employment of dispute-resolution methods, such as arbitration and mediation, that may be less costly than litigation.[4]A well-drafted parenting plan addresses both the custodial rights and responsibilities of parents who share custody of a minor child or children, and the logistical and other procedures for carrying out its substantive requirements.[5] Parents can agree to a plan that takes into consideration their children's ages and needs and, if they continue to co-parent effectively, can adjust their plans over time to ensure that their plan remains in the best interest of their children.[6]Some jurisdictions have guidelines, either default rules[7] (i.e., rules that apply only in the absence of provisions to the contrary) or hard-and-fast requirements to which all agreements must adhere,[8] addressing the content of parenting plans. Moreover, courts in some communities offer proposed templates whose terms take into account community-specific factors such as availability of day-care services, school-bus routes and schedules, and schedules of school and community athletics and other activities.[citation needed]Topics addressed in a parenting plan may include, but are not limited to:In some cases, parenting plans may be established through the combined effect of multiple agreements each addressing a different subject. For example, one agreement may address physical custody while another addresses financial support.A parenting plan agreed upon by the parties in an out-of-court setting is often termed "endorsed", "stipulated" or "on consent."[9][10] A judge who finds a stipulated parenting plan to be consistent with the child's best interest may be able approve the plan without requiring the parties or the child to be present in court, sparing the parents inconvenience and the child the emotional stress of dealing with authority figures in an unfamiliar setting.[citation needed]Parenting Plans in Australia[1] are a written agreement between two parents and are made without the assistance or endorsement of a court,[9] but can be made with the assistance of a mediator. Parenting plans can include as many or as few considerations about the child or children as both parents agree to. However child support payments are not generally included as payable child support is calculated by the Australian Government Child Support Agency (CSA).[11]Parenting plans are non-binding and not legally enforceable but may be written in such a way that they can submitted to a court for endorsement.[9] Once endorsed the parenting plan becomes a binding consent order.[9] Even if not endorsed by a court so as to be legally enforceable, if legal action is initiated after a parenting plan has been agreed between the parents, the court will give careful consideration and considerable weight to the agreed plan as it shows the intent of each parent at the time of signing.There is no such thing as a "standard" parenting plan as each one is unique, but unofficial example parenting plans are available.[12]The parental plan is introduced in the legislation in the Netherlands[13] and there is a law project in Belgium[14] to introduce it is, as well.In England and Wales the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, a non-departmental public body, produces a booklet Parenting Plans Putting your children first: a guide for separating parents.[15]Upon the introduction of the joint-custody in the national legislation in Romania, a standard parenting plan was released with the public. Parental plans appeared for the first time with the mediation law,[16] which provided in Articles 2 and 64 that parents may be mediated about how to raise children after divorce. Thus, although in Romania, in 2006-2011, only the notion of single custody was actually applicable in fact through mediation agreements, mediators have implemented legal arrangements for joint legal custody.[17] The plan was adapted to the specific of Romania and it is now being used by the mediators across the county. Due to the introduction (as of October 2011) of the joint parental authority, the notion of parental plan has legal support through, Article 506 of the new Civil Code. There is a proposal of non-governmental associations to implement the parental plan in tertiary legislation (implementation guide under the aegis of authorized institutions), but also to introduce this plan into primary legislation (these are amendments to Law 272/2004 initiated by the DGPC).In the United States of America, many[which?] state courts require that separating or divorcing couples who have children include a parenting plan among the terms of their separation agreement and/or their eventual divorce decree. Separated or unmarried parents may enter into a parenting plan of their own creation without going to court, but that plan won't be enforceable in court.[18]Parenting plans are usually initiated as part of a divorce decree or custody case between unmarried parents.  Divorced parents whose child custody is governed by a parenting plan can request that a court amend the plan or replace it with a new one.  In jurisdictions whose laws permit the practice, some plans permit the parties to amend certain provisions, such as those specifying where a parent will live during that parent's time with the child, by agreement without court approval.[citation needed]A court reviewing a petition for amendment or replacement of a court-ordered parenting plan will employ the "child's best interest" standard in light of circumstances or changes in circumstances such as a parent's relocation, the presence or absence of child abuse in one or both parents' households, and health problems of a parent or the child.[19] If the parents in a custody dispute request, many states allow children who are old enough to state an informed preference, to testify about their own preferences as to custody and parenting time, with their opinion taken into consideration by the court along with all other evidence relating to their best interest.[20]  The weight assigned by the court to a child's testimony will vary with factors such as the child's intellectual and psychological maturity, for which the child's age is often used as a proxy, the child's level of insight into his or her situation, and the credibility of the child's testimony as affected by factors ranging from the child's level of honesty to any undue influence on the child by either or both parents.Most states require that court-ordered parenting plans set forth the minimum amount of parenting time and access to which a noncustodial parent is entitled.[21][22][23][24][25] In these states, an agreement's failure to specify the non-custodial parent's minimum level of access can constitute grounds for appeal of the adjudicating court's approval of the plan.[citation needed]  In cases where separated or divorced parents live near each other, most U.S. states' family courts follow a default rule of granting the non-custodial parent the right of visitation on every second weekend and some holidays.

2011 Waveney District Council election;"Elections to Waveney District Council took place on Thursday 5 May 2011. This was the first election held as a Whole Council election following a change made to the electoral system in 2010.[1] As a result, all 48 council seats were contested.Before the election the Conservative Party had an overall majority on the council with 25 councillors. The Labour Party had 15 councillors, Liberal Democrats two, the Green Party one and there were three Independent councillors and two vacant seats.[2] As a result of the election the Conservative Party lost overall control, with both it and the Labour Party represented by 23 councillors, the balance of the council being made up of one Green Party and one Independent councillor.[3][4] A series of procedural moves led to the formation of a Conservative-led administration.[5][6][1] The two Conservative gains were the vacant seats in Oulton Broad and Southwold and Reydon. Both had been won by the party in 2008."

St Clement, Jersey;"St Clement (Jèrriais: Saint Cliément) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands. Its parish hall is around 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) south-east of St Helier. The parish has a population of 9,221[1] and is the second most densely populated.Located on the south-east coast of the island, stretching from Le Dicq in the west to near La Rocque in the east, it is the smallest parish, with a surface area of just 2,440 vergées (4 km2).The parish is largely suburbanised, with a large spread of post-war low-density housing development. There is no easily definable centre to the parish. The parish hall, schools and church are located in different areas. The parish is also home to a number of sports facilities, such as FB Fields and St Clement's Golf Club.In pre-Norman times, the area now known as St Clement was known as Petravilla or Pierreville. This is named for Peter, a monk who gave his lands in St Clement to the Mont Saint-Michel abbey.[2]The modern parish derives its name from its parish church, which is dedicated to St Clement, the third Pope in succession to St Peter. The church's full name is Saint Clement de Pierreville.[2]Samarès, its namesake manor, and now the name of a district of and a suburb located in St Clement, is a surname that is a corruption of the phrase "Salt marsh". It appeared in 1186 as Salmaresch.[2]Much of the parish lies below equinoctial high-tide level and was frequently flooded before Le Dicq was built to try to hold back the sea somewhat. There are remains of a submerged forest underneath the sand at Grève d'Azette that show how the parish has reduced in size as the sea has advanced. Large floods in 1688, 1796 and 1812 led to the coast road at Le Hocq being swept away by the sea and necessitated the coast road being rebuilt further inland.In 1172 it was recorded that a chapel existed in the parish, and there was a priory on the site of the old Priory Inn (now houses).In the 16th and 17th centuries the parish was believed to be the centre of a witch movement. According to beliefs, the rock at Rocque Berg (known as the Witches' Rock) was the focus for witchcraft in Jersey and witches would assemble there for their sabbats on Friday nights.After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, many French Protestants settled in the parish – as recorded on the church register.In the mid 19th century, the town began to spread east from St Helier into the west of the parish. Today there is relatively little open green space (with the exception of the golf and football fields) west of Samarès Lane into St Helier.The parish is a first-level administrative division of the Bailiwick of Jersey, a British Crown dependency. The highest official in the parish is the Connétable of St Clement. The incumbent office holder is Len Norman, who has held the office since 2008, previously having been a St Clement Deputy since 1983.[3]At present, the parish forms one electoral district for States Assembly elections and elects two Deputies, as well as eight Senators in an islandwide constituency. The current Deputies for St Clement are Lindsay Ash and Susie Pinel.[4] Lindsay Ash, who is Assistant Treasury Minister, faced criticism in 2021 over a tweet mocking Oprah Winfrey's appearance following her interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. He apologised if the comment caused any offence, but claimed the tweet was "observational comedy" and that he "would have mocked a man for his looks as well".[5] Under the proposed electoral reform, St Clement will form a single constituency, electing four representatives alongside its Connétable.[6]St Clement also has its own local administration. This, like each of the other eleven parishes, is made up of a Connétable, two Procureurs du Bien Public, who are also elected and oversee the finances of the parish, a Rector, responsible for the parish church, members of the parish Honorary Police (made up of Centeniers, Vingteniers and Constable's Officers), and other officers such as churchwardens, roads inspectors, rates assessors and a registrar. The parish is divided into vingtaines for administrative purposes as follows:The seat of the parish administration is the Salle Paroissiale, or Parish Hall, which is pictured above and located at Le Hocq. This is the newest parish hall in the island, the previous parish hall in St Clement was located at Caldwell Hall, on La Grande Route de St Clément (St Clement's Inner Road).St Clement is located in the south-east of the island of Jersey, the largest island of the Channel Islands archipelago, part of the British Isles. Administratively, the parish is a first-level administrative division of the Bailiwick of Jersey. It borders St Saviour to the west and north and Grouville to the east and north. It is a short distance from the boundary of the island's capital, St Helier, at Le Dicq, where there is only a short stretch of coastline in St Saviour.The parish is mostly low-lying and coastal, however, le Mont de Grouville stretches into the parish. The whole rocky inter-tidal zone that stretches along St Clement's coast is part of a Ramsar site of special significance.The parish has extensive suburban development, part of the urban sprawl of the town of St Helier. This includes residential estates at Samarès, Le Squez and Pontac. There is no real definable urban centre to the parish as the parish's facilities are spread out across its land area.The population of St Clement, according to the 2011 census is 9,221.[7]The dolmen at Mont Ubé (off La Blinerie) is believed to have been left there by a pre-Celtic race called the Iberians, in around 3,000 B.C. Remains of a cemetery on La Motte (Green Island) are believed to be from later settlers.[8] A Neolithic cairn and middens on La Motte have also been investigated.Samarès Manor (Jèrriais: Mangni d'Sanmathès) is a manor house with medieval origins in the Vingtaine de Samarès, and is the traditional home of the Seigneur de Samarès. The name Samarès is an old French word meaning salt-marsh, and much of the low lying surrounding areas are or were coastal marshes.Le Hocq Tower was built in 1778 as a coastal defence against the French when they sided with the American colonies against the British.Seymour Tower sits two miles offshore on one of the largest inter-tidal reefs in the world. Built as part of Jersey's coastal defences, this square tower dates from the 18th century.[9]St Clement is twinned with:Before 2010, it was the only parish to not be twinned to a French town and it is the only parish to be twinned with a town in Brittany rather than Normandy.[10]There are two main roads that run east–west through the parish: the A5 St Clement's Inner Road (known in French as La Grande Route de St Clement) and the A6 St Clement's Coast Road (known in French as La Grande Route de la Côte).The Eastern Cycle Network is focused within the parish, with plans to construct a cycle route from the boundary with St Saviour to the boundary with Grouville (onto Gorey and St Helier). As part of the scheme, a number of new cycle paths have opened in the parish, such as near Le Rocquier School,[11] and a modal filter was introduced on Rue de Maupertuis.[12]St Clement has two primary schools and one secondary school within its borders.Le Rocquier School is a secondary school, on La Grande Route de St Clement. The original school buildings were replaced with a new building in 2006.[13]The parish school of St Clement is located on Rue de la Chapelle, a short distance from Le Rocquier School. The original buildings dates back to 1901, and was replaced in 2006 with a brand new building on the opposite side of the road.Samarès School (formerly Le Squez School) is the other primary school, which is located further east in School Road.[14]The parish church of St Clement[15] is an ancient place of Anglican worship located on La Grande Route de St Clément (St Clement's inner road). St Nicholas is a smaller, sister church, located on La Grande Route de la Côte (the coast road). It was opened in 1927 after being planned, financed and largely built by the Reverend L.B. Lee.The St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church is located on La Grande Route de St Clément at Samarès.The Samarès Methodist Church[16] is located on La Grande Route de la Côte, and is the southernmost church in the British Isles.[17] However, as of February 2012, there are no longer any religious services at the church, but the church remains open for use as a community centre.There are a number of sports centres located within the parish.FB Playing Fields is a large outdoor sports centre located on the St Clement's Inner Road. The site was gifted to the island under a Covenant by Florence Boot, the wife of the man who transformed the Boots pharmacy chain into a national retailer. Sports played at the fields include athletics, cricket, football and netball. The Jersey Eastern Railway formerly ran through the site.[18]The St Clement's Golf Club and Sports Centre is home to a nine-hole golf course measuring 2,637 yards (2,411 m) as well as a three-hole Academy golf course.[19] The site was opened in 1913 as the Jersey Recreation Grounds. Initially, the centre only had tennis courts and a bowling green. The St Clement's Golf Club, the St Clement's Ladies' Golf Club and the Jersey Squash and Racquetball Club are located on the site.[20]As part of the Government's Inspiring Active Places Strategy, a new facility will be constructed at Le Rocquier school to replace the existing school facilities. The target date for this is 2024/25. This will also provide a hub for public sports in the east of the island. It includes a large sports hall, a 3G football pitch, a permanent specialist gymnastics facility and a large fitness suite. There is the potential to provide a new swimming pool.The famous French writer Victor Hugo lived in Marina Terrace, St Clement for some time, and it was here that he wrote his collection of poems entitled Les Châtiments. It was the Connétable of St Clement at the time who escorted Hugo onto a steamer bound for Guernsey when he had insulted the British Royal Family in some of his letters.[8]Coordinates: 49°10′13″N 2°04′20″W﻿ / ﻿49.17037°N 2.07230°W﻿ / 49.17037, -2.07230"

IPv6 deployment;"Deployment of the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), the latest generation of the Internet Protocol, has been in progress since the mid-2000s. IPv6 was designed as a replacement for IPv4. IPv4 has been in use since 1982, and is in the final stages of exhausting its unallocated address space, but still carries most Internet traffic.[1]As of April 2022[update] Google's statistics show IPv6 availability of its users at around 34–38% depending on the day of the week (greater on weekends).[2] Adoption is uneven across countries and Internet service providers. Many countries have 0% use while a few have over 50% use, such as India and Germany. In November 2016, 1,491 (98.2%) of the 1,519 top-level domains (TLDs) in the Internet supported IPv6 to access their domain name servers, and 1,485 (97.8%) zones contained IPv6 glue records, and approximately 9.0 million domains (4.6%) had IPv6 address records in their zones. Of all networks in the global BGP routing table, 29.2% had IPv6 protocol support.[3][4]By 2011, all major operating systems in use on personal computers and server systems had production-quality IPv6 implementations. Cellular telephone systems present a large deployment field for Internet Protocol devices as mobile telephone service continues to make the transition from 3G to 4G technologies, in which voice is provisioned as a voice over IP (VoIP) service. In 2009, the US cellular operator Verizon released technical specifications for devices to operate on its 4G networks.[5] The specification mandates IPv6 operation according to the 3GPP Release 8 Specifications (March 2009), and deprecates IPv4 as an optional capability.[5]Tools such as 6rd, conceived by Rémi Després, have been developed to enable IPv6 rapid deployment.Google publishes statistics on IPv6 adoption among Google users. A graph of IPv6 adoption since 2008 and a map of IPv6 deployment by country are available.[6][7]Akamai publishes by-country and by-network statistics on IPv6 adoption for traffic it sees on its global Content Distribution Network (CDN). This set of data also shows graphs for each country and network over time.[8]A global view into the history of the growing IPv6 routing tables can be obtained with the SixXS Ghost Route Hunter.[9] This tool provided a list of all allocated IPv6 prefixes until 2014 and marks with colors the ones that were actually being announced into the Internet BGP tables. When a prefix was announced, it means that the ISP at least can receive IPv6 packets for their prefix.The integration of IPv6 on existing network infrastructure may be monitored from other sources, for example:A few organizations are involved with international IPv6 test and evaluation, ranging from the United States Department of Defense to the University of New Hampshire.By 2011, all major operating systems in use on personal computers and server systems had production-quality IPv6 implementations.[42] Microsoft Windows has supported IPv6 since Windows 2000,[43] and in production-ready state beginning with Windows XP. Windows Vista and later have improved IPv6 support.[44] macOS since Panther (10.3), Linux 2.6, FreeBSD, and Solaris also have mature production implementations. Some implementations of the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file transfer protocol make use of IPv6 to avoid NAT issues common for IPv4 private networks.[45]In the early 2000s, governments increasingly required support for IPv6 in new equipment. The US government, for example, specified in 2005 that the network backbones of all federal agencies had to be upgraded to IPv6 by June 30, 2008, this was completed before the deadline.[46][47][48][49] In addition, the US government in 2010 required federal agencies to provide native dual-stacked IPv4/IPv6 access to external/public services by 2012, and internal clients were to utilize IPv6 by 2014.[50] Progress on the US government's external facing IPv6 services is tracked by NIST. The government of the People's Republic of China implemented a five-year plan for deployment of IPv6 called the China Next Generation Internet (see below).On 7 March 2013, the Internet Engineering Task Force created a working group for IPv4 sunset in preparation for protocol changes that could be used to support sunset/shutdown of remanent IPv4 networks.[51][52] However, in May 2018 this working group was closed as no immediate work could be identified due to the slow transition to IPv6.[53]The Internet Engineering Task Force expects IPv6 to coexist with IPv4 as it is considered impractical to transition to IPv6 in the short term.[54][55] The coexistence is expected to be based on dual-stack, tunneling or translation mechanisms.[56] Dual-stack implementations required two parallel logical networks, increasing cost and complexity of the network.[57] IPv4 networks are expected to slowly transition into segmented subnetworks using IPv4 Residual Deployment.[58]The slow transition to IPv6 has caused significant resentment in the Internet community.[59][60]As a result, many larger enterprises, such as Microsoft, are transitioning to phasing out IPv4, and moving towards IPv6 Single-Stack within the company. In a recent blog, the company describes their heavily translated IPv4 network as "potentially fragile", "operationally challenging", and with regard to dual-stack operations (i.e. those running IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously) "complex".[61]AnwarNet (www.anwarnet.dz), AfriNIC has allocated range of IPv6 address space to AnwarNet. AnwarNet started IPV6 services in 2011.As of April 2021, Brazil has 38.4% IPv6 adoption.[7] IPv6 adoption in the country was boosted in 2015 when the Brazilian telecommunications agency, Anatel, announced that all Internet operators and service providers would be required to provide IPv6 addresses to consumers. This was one of a number of initiatives to increase the speed of deployment.[81]Has constructed a research center to study the possibilities of adopting IPv6 in the country. The center will operate alongside another facility, which is equipped with an IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer.[82]Since 2015, the ISP Blizoo enabled IPv6 for many home customers.At the end of 2016, the ISP ComNet Bulgaria Holding Ltd. has provided complete IPv6 support for all customers and households within company network in Bulgaria.[83]IPv6 deployment is slow but ongoing, with major Canadian ISPs (notably Bell Canada) lacking in support for its residential customers, and the majority of their business customers (including server packages). According to Google's statistics, Canada reached an IPv6 adoption rate of 39.66% as of May 2022.[2]The China Next Generation Internet (CNGI, 中国下一代互联网) project is an ongoing plan initiated by the Chinese government with the purpose of gaining a significant position in the development of the Internet through the early adoption of IPv6. China showcased CNGI's IPv6 infrastructure during the 2008 Summer Olympics, being the first time a major world event has had a presence on the IPv6 Internet.[97] At the time of the event, it was believed that the Olympics provided the largest showcase of IPv6 technology since the inception of IPv6.[98] The deployment of IPv6 was widespread in all related applications, from data networking and camera transmissions for sporting events, to civil applications, such as security cameras and taxis. The events were streamed live over the Internet and networked cars were able to monitor traffic conditions readily, all network operations of the Games being conducted using IPv6.[99]Also, the CERNET (China Education and Research NETwork, 中国教育和科研计算机网, 教育网) set up native IPv6 (CERNET2), and since then many academic institutions in China joined CERNET2 for IPv6 connectivity. CERNET-2 is probably the widest deployment of IPv6 in China. It is managed and operated jointly by 25 universities.[100] Students in Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, for example, get native IPv6.[101][102]In 2017, China issued an "Action Plan for Promoting Large-scale Deployment of Internet Protocol Version 6" where it encouraged a nationwide adoption of the IPv6 network. Outlined in the plan, China had set goals to develop a next generation internet technical system and industrial ecosystem with independent intellectual property rights in 5 to 10 years, and aimed at having the largest IPv6 network in the world by the end of 2025.[103]In 2018, US researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology categorised China as being part of a group of 169 countries that had little IPv6 traffic. As of 2021, Akamai's latest State of the Internet Report asserts an IPv6 adoption rate of 23.5% among Chinese internet connections.[104]In July 2021, China announced plans to complete a national IPv6 rollout by 2030. It is the only country known to advocate towards a single-stack network and had earlier in May 2021, overtaken India in becoming the Number 1 country in terms of having the most IPv6 addresses in the world, with 528 million.[105]As of September 2019, the country has deployment ratio around 22.91%, both by Google and APNIC stats.As of April 2022, the country has only 7.22% IPv6 traffic, according to Google stats.[2]A web page (in Danish) follows national IPv6 deployment.[109]The ISP Fullrate has begun offering IPv6 to its customers, on the condition that their router (provided by the ISP itself) is compatible.[110] If the router is of a different version, the customer has to request a new router.Several other small ISP have already began implementing the protocol as well as 3, the smallest mobile provider.Estonian Telekom is providing native IPv6 access on residential and business broadband connections since September 2014. According to Google's statistics, Estonia has reached an IPv6 adoption rate of 28% by July 2020.[2]FICORA (Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority), the NIC for the .fi top level domain, has added IPv6 address to DNS servers, and allows entering IPv6 address when registering domains.[111] The registration service domain.fi for new domains is also available over IPv6.A small Finnish ISP Nebula has offered IPv6 access since 2007.[112]FICORA held national IPv6 day on June 9, 2015.[113] At that time Elisa and DNA Oyj started providing IPv6 on mobile subscriptions, and Telia Company (via 6rd) and DNA Oyj (native) started providing IPv6 on fixed-line connections.According to Google's statistics, Finland has reached an IPv6 adoption rate of 40% as of February 2022[update].[114]As of April 2022, France has 66.73% IPv6 traffic according to Google, and 46% according to APNIC.[127]According to Google's statistics, Germany has reached an IPv6 adoption rate of 61% by April 2022.[128][2]In Hungary Externet was the first ISP starting deploying IPv6 on its network in 2008 August.[151] The service was commercially available since 2009 May.[152][153]Magyar Telekom was running tests on its production environments since the beginning of 2009. Free customer trials started on November 2, 2009, for those on ADSL or Fiber Optic.[154][155] Customers are given a /128 via DHCP-ND unless they register their DUID in which case they receive a /56 –  using a static configuration results in a single /64.According to information on telecompaper.com,[156] UPC Hungary will start deploying IPv6 in mid-2013, finishing it in 2013. The plan has not materialized until the end of 2015.[157]In 2015, December RCS&RDS (Digi) has enabled native dual-stack IPv6 (customers receive dynamic /64 prefixes) for its FTTB/H customers.[158][159][160][161] In November the same year UPC Hungary introduced DS Lite(with private IPv4 addresses)[162] which can be enabled on a customer-to-customer basis if the customer asks for it.Magyar Telekom deployed dual-stack IPv6 (using dynamic /56 prefixes on DSL and GPON and static /56 prefixes on DOCSIS) for all of its wired (and for all of its compatible mobile) customers in October 2016.[163][164][165][166][167]According to the statistics of APNIC, IPv6 use in Hungary as of 2018 December has reached around 20%.[168]According to Google's IPv6 statistics the adoption rate in Hungary as of April 2022 is 42%.[2]According to Google's statistics, India has reached an IPv6 adoption rate of around 63.1% in April 2022.[2]As of 2018, APNIC placed India at more than 70% preferring IPv6.[169]Growth of IPv6 in Ireland as seen by Google.According to Google's statistics, Italy had an IPv6 adoption rate of 5.29% by January 2022.[2]According to Google's statistics, Japan had an IPv6 adoption rate of 43.79% by April 2022.[2]The LITNET academic & research network has supported IPv6 since 2001. Most commercial ISPs have not publicly deployed IPv6 yet.According to Google's statistics, Luxembourg reached an IPv6 adoption rate of 36% by July 2020.[2]In 2012, surveys conducted by the New Zealand IPv6 Task Force indicated that awareness of IPv6 had reached a near-universal level among New Zealand's large public- and private-sector organisations, with adoption mostly occurring as part of normal network refresh cycles. Most of New Zealand's ISP and carrier community have a test environment for IPv6 and many[quantify] have started bringing IPv6 products and services on-stream.[209] An increasing number of New Zealand government websites are available over IPv6, including those of the Ministry of Defence (New Zealand), Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand) and the Department of Internal Affairs.The government is in process of upgrading its facilities.[211] Globe Telecom has already set in motion the transition of its core IP network to IPv6, noting that it is now fully prepared even as the Internet runs out of IPv4 addresses. Globe claims it is the first local telecommunication company to test IPv6 with Department of Science and Technology (Philippines). In some cases, like test networks or users, IPv6 or both maybe present[212] Since then, Globe Telecom has successfully deployed IPv6 in 2020 on its 5G network.[213]University of the Philippines Diliman is part of the World IPv6 Launch and deployed IPv6 on its network since 2011.[214]PLDT takes lead in IPv6 deployment in the Philippines and provides IPv6 to its customers since 2020.[215][216]Dito Telecommunity provides IPv6 to its customers since its start of operation.[217]Sky Cable on its Sky Fiber broadband service provides IPv6 to its customers since 2019.[218][219]The Sudanese IPv6 task Force SDv6TF was formed in 2010 to fellow the implementation of IPv6 migration plan (2011–2015).[229]By November 2012, all telecom operators are becoming IPv6 enabled, this was tested for the first time at the AFRINIC-17 meeting held in Khartoum.[230]SudREN[231] (Sudanese Research and Education Network) is the first ISP to provide native IPv6 connectivity of the member institution. By August 2014, SudREN.edu.sd is fully IPv6 Enabled.Two certification received from IPv6 Forum,[232] for WWW and ISP Enabled Logos.Operators offering native IPv6 access for business clients and collocation customers include Tele2 and Phonera.Started deploying IPv6 in 2010. In 2011, ATI (Tunisian Internet Agency) obtained a new IPv6 block from AFRINIC (2c0f:fab0::/28). In 2013–2015, Gnet (Global Net), and CIMSP (Computing Departement of Health Ministry) received IPv6 prefixes from AFRINIC. Deployment of an IPv6 tunnel between ATI and HE (Hurricane Electric). In 2016, CCK (Centre de Calcul El Khawarizmi) obtains its own IPv6 (/32) block from AFRINIC. In 2016, ISET Charguia (Higher Institute of Technologies in Tunisia) deployed its IPv6 network as end user.Some IPv6 implementation has taken place.According to Google's statistics, United Kingdom has reached an IPv6 adoption rate of 43.55% as of April 2022.[2]In the United States the majority of smartphones use IPv6, but only a small percent of computers and tablets use IPv6. As of April 2022[update], 46.2% of Google users in the US use IPv6.[2]As of January 2021[2]The Internet Society promoted June 8, 2011, as "World IPv6 Day".[269] The event was described as a "test drive" for full IPv6 rollouts.[270]The Internet Society declared June 6, 2012, to be the date for "World IPv6 Launch", with participating major websites enabling IPv6 permanently, participating ISPs offering IPv6 connectivity,[271] and participating router manufacturers offering devices enabled for IPv6 by default.[271][272]"

Abi is hit by Dean Wicks' (Matt Di Angelo) car, suffering a broken wrist, cuts and bruises, but she recovers with no long-term impairment.

Jay and Abi plan to have sex several times, but on each occasion, they are unable to go through with it. At one time, Jay and Abi cuddle up as they are watching television, but Max believes they are about to have sex, so he throws Jay out and rips Abi's bridesmaid dress to Greg and Tanya's wedding.

Abi goes to visit him but when Tanya discovers they have been seeing each other, she bans Abi from speaking to him. However, they eventually reunite. Abi, along with the rest of her family, are devastated to discover that when Max was away in Manchester, he married Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing). Abi meets her cousin Dexter Hartman (Khali Best), not knowing they are related, and this causes Jay to be jealous until the truth of their relationship is revealed. Tanya ejects Max from the family home after discovering he loves Kirsty. Abi loses her virginity to Jay much to her parents' disappointment. Abi tries to support Lauren with her drinking problem, however, this ends badly when Lauren destroys Abi's revision notes. Abi is distraught when Tanya leaves Walford with Lauren and Oscar as Lauren goes into a rehabilitation clinic in Exeter, so Max decides to move back in with her after Kirsty confesses that she has lied about being pregnant. Abi is defensive of her father and she argues with Kirsty about it, blaming her for her family's breakdown.While on holiday with Jay and their friends, Abi thinks she could be pregnant. Jay hopes to be a father, while Abi would prefer to have an abortion. She is not pregnant, but ends their relationship, believing that they want different things. However, they soon reconcile.

She also takes in a stray dog, Tramp.When Lauren's friend Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) is murdered (see Who Killed Lucy Beale?), Max supports her father Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) through his grief. Seeing this, Abi calls him hypocritical, before revealing that she saw him kissing Lucy days before she was killed and they were having an affair. Max urges Abi to keep it a secret, but Phil discovers the affair from Jay and tells Ian. Abi proceeds to move into her grandmother, Cora Cross' (Ann Mitchell) new flat with Lauren. She eventually forgives Max and returns home. Her final A Level results come through, and she tells everyone that she has got what she needed to get into the University of Liverpool. However, she later confides in Jay that she has been lying, as not to disappoint her family. He encourages her to go through clearing, and she gets a position doing a similar course at the University of Bolton. Jay decides to go with Abi, which Max at first is opposed to, but he comes around eventually. Ben returns from prison and reunites Jay and Phil, and Jay agrees to attend Phil's wedding to Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean), holding off on going to Bolton. At the wedding, Phil's aunt, Sal (Anna Karen), comments that she believed Lola to be Jay's girlfriend. Ben then reveals he thinks Jay is in love with Lola, and he confesses this to Abi when she confronts him. He then ends things to stay in Walford. Devastated, she wants to leave for Bolton immediately, but when Max refuses to take her, she drives the car herself, accidentally running over Tramp, killing him, she callously declares that "things die".After her break up with Jay, Abi becomes a much nastier and bitter person. She begins a relationship with Ben (now played by Harry Reid), which is discovered by Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) who informs Max of the relationship. Max demands that Abi does not see Ben any more, which Abi refuses to do. Abi later discovers that Max used Ben to sign over part of Phil's businesses to him. In February 2015, Abi is accused by Max of killing Lucy. Abi did not kill Lucy, but it is revealed that on the night Lucy died, Abi had a confrontation with Lucy about her affair with Max, which resulted in Abi slapping Lucy. After Max tells her that Tanya would like her to move to Devon with her, Abi refuses and instead moves in with Ben and his family. and Abi believes she finally has a stable home life. After she moves in, Ben reveals to her that he might still be gay and is worried he will never get over his homosexuality but Abi assures him that they will make things work. She continuously mocks Jay and accuses him of being jealous of her relationship with Ben. Jay tries to make Abi see that Ben is not interested in her, but she pretends not to care about what Jay says. Abi discovers a letter from Sharon's birth mother and Sharon says that she intends on meeting her birth father after discovering that her mother has died. When Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) arrives in Walford, Abi suspects Ben of cheating on her with Paul. She and Ben have sex, so Ben can convince her he is not gay. Following Ben's arrest for Lucy's murder, Abi tells Phil that Max assaulted Lucy to get Ben off. Despite being innocent, Max turns himself in and is formally charged while Ben is released. Stacey visits Max, who tells her that he thinks Abi killed Lucy. Stacey confronts Abi, who attacks Stacey, blaming her for her parents' split and Bradley's death, and later vents to her aunt Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) that she does not think Max cares about her. Carol visits Max in prison, where he informs her that the reason he thinks Abi killed Lucy is because she attacked and beat her on the night of the murder. After confronting Abi on this, Carol agrees that she has been out of control lately and advises her to call Tanya for moral support. During the phone call, Abi finds out that not only is Oscar ill, but Cora had apparently not stayed with Tanya at her house as she had earlier said. Abi, Carol and Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) find Cora living rough and bring her home. She reveals she saw Max and Abi cleaning the car lot after Lucy was killed, forcing Abi to admit that Max and Lucy had argued there and she was helping Max clean Lucy's blood. Abi then gives a statement to the police. Max is later found guilty of the murder.Ben and Abi continue their relationship, but Ben is still secretly seeing Paul. Babe Smith (Annette Badland) offers Abi work in the pub kitchen, and Abi tells Babe that she is able to turn a blind eye to Ben's homosexuality as long as he loves her. However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him out of the room and confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground. Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.Abi and Babe discover that Ben's half-sister Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) has been using Phil's credit card, so they force her to return everything she has bought. Babe asks Abi for a favour, but Abi realises that Babe has already assumed that she would say yes, so calls Babe a user. As revenge, Babe sends Ben a letter, telling him of the fake pregnancy. Louise finds the letter and blackmails Abi, telling her to move away with Ben. Abi tries to persuade Ben into moving but he refuses, saying he needs to be there for alcoholic Phil, and Abi tells Louise that Ben will always believe his girlfriend over his sister. Abi tells Babe that she is worried that Ben will find out, so Babe suggests that Abi tells Ben the truth. However, Abi allows Louise to continue using Phil's credit card. Later, Abi catches Ben and Louise arguing and assumes it is over the letter, and she inadvertently reveals she was never pregnant, but Ben was referring to Phil's credit card. In The Vic, Ben gets drunk and kisses Abi in the toilets and starts to undress her, but then drags her into the pub in her underwear and reveals via the karaoke microphone that she made up her pregnancy. Abi is humiliated and is taken to Dot Branning's (June Brown) house by her uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), however, an enraged Phil takes her away in his car, but is stopped by Jay, who insists that enough people have been hurt. When Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) confesses to killing Lucy, Max is released, but refuses to see Abi or Lauren.Abi gets her job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's pregnant fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi to confess to Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However, Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room as an act of revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's boyfriend, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. At Abi's 21st birthday party, Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven. Abi helps Steven keep up the lie by giving him a brain scan from a dog and animal medication that will give him symptoms of an illness, and helping to keep Lauren away from doctor's appointments that Steven has invented.Abi discovers that Ian's restaurant is on fire and goes inside. She finds Jane on the floor struggling to breathe. A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her and drag her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells Steven he is going to be a father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then dies from injuries inflicted by Max during the fire, leaving an unaware Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Steven's tumour lie is revealed, so Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together. When they both return to Walford, Abi is fired from her job at the vets when they have CCTV evidence of her stealing medication. She asks Mick to extend her working hours at The Queen Vic, but he makes her redundant as they need to save money. Lauren eventually learns the truth about Abi and Steven's affair when she catches Abi wearing her wedding dress. Lauren finds out that Abi has Steven's ashes, and she takes his ashes to be flushed down the toilet. When Abi tries to stop her, the ashes scatter everywhere. Lauren is later disgusted to learn that Abi is pregnant with Steven's baby. However, Lauren becomes more supportive. Ian talks to Abi about expanding his restaurant business into franchises, saying he can pass it onto Abi's nephew Louie Beale, so Abi tells Ian that he will have another grandchild as she is carrying Steven's baby, but Ian says Steven was not his son and then tells Max that Abi is pregnant.Abi goes away and on her return is confused when people are showing hatred towards Max, unaware that he was involved in a plan to redevelop Albert Square, including turning business into luxury flats and evicting people from their homes and places of work. Abi and Lauren discover that Max knows Abi is pregnant, Lauren disowns him while Abi tries to offer support, but he insults her. However, when Max tries to bake a cake for Oscar, he gets Abi to help him and they make amends. However, it is revealed that Max caused Matthew Mitchell Cotton, Jack's stepson, to be taken away from Jack. Abi turns on her father once more but when he gives her a thoughtful present for Christmas, she agrees to have Christmas dinner with him. On Christmas Day, Tanya returns to take Lauren and Abi away from Walford, revealing that Max killed Steven and tried to kill Jane. Lauren and Abi reject Max. Max goes to the roof of The Queen Vic, planning to jump, so Lauren and Abi climb on to the ledge to try and stop him. As Max agrees to his daughter's pleas to not jump, Lauren slips on the wet surface and Abi grabs her hand to stop her falling, both sisters fall off to the ground. Still alive, they are taken to hospital, where an ultrasound shows Abi's baby is alive. Abi has a CT scan and Lauren has surgery. Lauren recovers but Dr. Harding (Nick Waring) tells Max that Abi is brainstem dead and has no chance of regaining consciousness. Abi's baby is delivered via cesarean section. Max is hopeful that Abi will recover and does not tell Lauren the truth, but she slaps Max when she finds out. Max obtains a court order to stop Abi's life support being withdrawn and plans to take her to the US for a treatment that will cost £2,000,000, but Harding urges Max to do the dignified thing for Abi as she is already dead and as Abi is not a minor, he has no legal right to take her. Max barricades himself in Abi's hospital room, but is talked into letting the hospital staff in when a nurse tells Max about her own son's death and that she never got to say goodbye. When Dr. Harding explains what will happen to Max and Lauren, Max asks if the life support can be withdrawn at Abi's time of birth, 8.32 pm. Tanya, Cora and her aunt Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) return but Cora tells Max that Tanya does not want him present when the life support is withdrawn. Max finds Tanya in the hospital's chapel and she is angry with Max that Abi has to die because of him. However, just before Abi's life support is withdrawn, Tanya requests Max to be there. Abi then dies, leaving her family devastated. Following her funeral, Abi is toasted in The Queen Vic and her friends let off white balloons, while Max names her baby Abi Branning, in her memory.Abi was introduced into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006.[7] She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are an extension of the Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July.[8] Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point".[8] Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition.[9] As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines.[8] In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older.[10] In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both.[9] Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was "just making noises".[9] Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.[10]She may be young, but she's packed plenty of drama into her years. She's been hit by Deano's car, watched her parents' marriage unravel, ravel, unravel again etc. She also discovered Trina's dead body in Charlie's summer-house. Most kids would have nightmares for weeks after a sighting like that. Water off a duck's back when you're Derek Branning's niece, though.Abi has been described by the official EastEnders website as the family's "golden girl" compared to Lauren, hinting that she knows how to get her own way.[11] She has been described as "bubbly" and "self-assured" with a nose for mischief.[11] She has also been described as having the biggest heart in Walford, bringing out the best in the people around her.[11] Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Abi is a "real soft touch".[12] Jon Wise from The People said that after Abi received a makeover in 2010, she "actually turned out to be quite pretty".[13] In 2012, Fitzgerald told Inside Soap's Laura-Jane Tyler that Abi has grown up in her first six years on screen, and is now sensible, "like a mother hen" and has had to mature quickly because of the dramatic situations she has been involved in.[10] Tyler added that Abi is the most level-headed and sensible member of the Branning family and "puts her [family] to shame with her mature approach to [their problems]."[10]Abi's earlier storylines consist of her parents fighting for custody of her and her siblings,[14] being injured in a collision with Deano Wicks' (Di Angelo) car[15] and helping her friend Ben (Jones) with his abuse from stepmother Stella Crawford (Thompson)[16][17] In February 2011, Abi was involved in a car accident with Max and would suffer severe injuries after their car collides with a lorry on the way to Tanya's wedding to her new partner Greg (Booth). The crash scenes were filmed on 6 March 2011[18] and aired on 14 April 2011.[19] After these minor storylines, Joyner said that Fitzgerald should be involved in more complex storylines in 2012.[20] She said, "I think it's going to be an exciting year for Lorna. She's been a natural on the show ever since she was younger, and I think she's one of our best actresses. What's lovely about this year is that she'll be doing her GCSEs, and then once that's out of the way, she can get something that's a bit heavier and a bit bigger. She'll be old enough to work longer hours, so I think they'd be mad if they didn't give her something to sink her teeth into at some point this year".[20]In November 2010, after sister Lauren was recast to Jossa, Jossa stated that she enjoys working with Fitzgerald, adding the two have a lot in common.[21] Jossa, in 2012, wanted Lauren and Abi to bond more.[22] She commented: "I think realistically they would when they're going through a family problem like this. It would bring the family a little bit closer. I think they are quite close already and they have a lot of family banter! They may not like each other as people, but they love each other as family".[22] In December 2012, Fitzgerald conducted her first magazine interview and spoke of a storyline where Abi comforts Lauren over a relationship break up, saying "It's nice to see the little [sister] taking care of the bigger one."[10]In March 2011, Abi starts a relationship with Jay (Jamie Borthwick).[23] Borthwick admitted that he is enjoying filming Jay and Abi's relationship.[23] Speaking of Jay and Abi's relationship, Borthwick told Inside Soap, "I think Abi and Jay are a good couple," he said. "Jay's a right one – he's already had a crack at Abi's sister Lauren and now he's going for the younger one. He's got an eye for the Branning women".[23] Fitzgerald said that Jay and Abi are "cute together" but she cringes at Abi because she is "lovey-dovey".[10] The couple split in 2014 and Abi begins a relationship with Ben, knowing that he is gay but dismissing this and branding it a "phase". Speaking of his role, newcomer Harry Reid stated that Ben would "manipulate" Abi in his attempts to prove that he is straight.[24]On 10 September 2017, it was announced that Fitzgerald had been axed from the show by executive consultant John Yorke, along with Jacqueline Jossa. A spokesperson said: "We can confirm Jacqueline and Lorna will be leaving. They have been wonderful to work with and we wish them all the best for the future."[25] Fitzgerald's final episode was broadcast on 19 January 2018, in which the character dies.[26] At the end of the episode, instead of the usual closing title sequence, the image, focused on Abi's face, fades to black and no theme music is played.[27]Fitzgerald was nominated for the "Best Young Actor" at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards for her portrayal of Abi [28] though lost out to Coronation Street's, Alex Bain, who plays Simon Barlow.[29] Fitzgerald won the award for "Best Dramatic Performance from a Young Actor or Actress" at the 2012 British Soap Awards 2012[30] an award which Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said was "well deserved".[31] Fitzgerald said she did not expect to win the award.[10] In January 2012, Kate White of Inside Soap praised both Fitzgerald and her character, saying "In Fitzgerald, EastEnders has the brightest young star in soap. The rest of her family are getting all the juicy stuff right now, but Abi's destined for great dramatic things. Mark our words".[3] Her colleague, Steven Murphy, said Inside Soap had "long admired" Fitzgerald.[32]Stewart said, due to Max's past events with his family, what Abi might say when Max objects to her relationship with Jay, "It won't be her setting a gerbil on him", calling her a "goody-two-shoes".[31] A writer from the Western Mail said that the Branning/Mitchell Feud makes Abi and Jay feel like "Walford's answer to Romeo and Juliet".[4] Two writers from the Daily Mirror mocked the storyline where Abi turns down the trip to Costa Rica. One said, "An extreme case of soap agoraphobia as brilliant Abi sensibly turns down the chance to spend eight weeks in the tropical paradise of Costa Rica. But in the tiny micro-world of EastEnders, even the three-mile odyssey from Walford to the West End is considered an epic journey. So Central America is simply out of the question"[33] with another saying, "Abi was a little girl arranging tearful funerals for her pets. But now she's a young teenager, secretly engaged to boyfriend Jay and planning to run away together. He then gives Abi an ultimatum: him or her trip to Costa Rica. Best pass her the suncream, then".[34] However, Abi, along with the younger members of the cast were thought to be the blame of declining ratings for the show, "In the last two months, viewers have seen lots of Lauren, Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), Ben Jay, Abi and Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) – but not nearly so much of the classic characters".[5] Inside Soap noted that Abi and Jay's relationship was popular with viewers.[10]The 2016 storyline in which Abi lies that she has suffered a miscarriage to cover up a pregnancy lie was criticised by Zoe Clark-Coates, co-founder and CEO of The Mariposa Trust, who said, "To regularly see TV shows using fake miscarriages as light entertainment could make people question genuine losses."[35] In August 2017, Fitzgerald was longlisted for "Best Bad Girl" at the 2017 Inside Soap Awards, while she and Aaron Sidwell (Steven Beale) were longlisted for "Best Partnership".[36] Fitzgerald made the viewer-voted shortlist in the "Best Bad Girl" category,[37] but lost out to Gillian Kearney, who portrays Emma Barton in Emmerdale.[38] The scene where Lauren and Abi fell from the roof of The Queen Vic was awarded "Scene of the Year" at the 2018 British Soap Awards, tying with Doctors who also won the same award for "The Bollywood Proposal".[39] Abi's death was nominated for "Most devastating Soap Death" at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards, it came in seventh place with 6.4% of the total votes.[40]"
Muhsin al-Qazwini;"Muhsin Baqir al-Musawi al-Qazwini (Arabic: محسن باقر الموسوي القزويني, b. 1951) is an Iraqi author, politician, essayist, college professor, and founder of the Ahl al-Bayt University in Karbala.[1][2][3][4]al-Qazwini was born in Karbala, hailing from the prominent religious al-Qazwini family. His father, Sayyid Baqir al-Qazwini was a cleric.[5] His mother is from the Arab Shammar tribe.He grew up in Iraq, and gained his bachelor's degree in 1974 from the Osol Aldeen College in the University of Baghdad. With rising pressures from the Baathist regime, he immigrated to Kuwait in 1975, and then to Iran in 1977. He then moved to Lebanon, and gained his masters and doctorate from the Islamic University of Imam al-Auzai in Beirut in 1992 and 1995.[3][6]al-Qazwini returned to Iraq after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2004, he became a member of the Coalition Provisional Authority and in 2005, he became a member on the board of writing the constitution.[1][7][8]al-Qazwini sought to start an Islamic university, and did so by initiating a virtual university on the internet in 2000 as the Ahl Al Bayt International University.[3] After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, al-Qazwini moved back Karbala, and at the Ministry of Higher Education's discretion, he managed to purchase a building and establish the university on the ground. In 2007, al-Qazwini purchased a plot of land sized at 7000 m2, that was 4 kilometres from the shrine of Imam Hussein, and built a second branch for the university.[9] This moved allowed a wider expansion for the university and saw the opening of many more faculties.[1]al-Qazwini has published 16 books, some of these include:al-Qazwini has had more than 30 scientific and research papers on Islamic sciences, laws and politics published.[2]"

Enterolobium cyclocarpum;"Several, see textEnterolobium cyclocarpum, commonly known as guanacaste, caro caro, monkey-ear tree, or elephant-ear tree, is a species of flowering tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to tropical regions of the Americas, from central Mexico south to northern Brazil (Roraima) and Venezuela.[1] It is known for its large proportions, expansive, often spherical crown, and curiously shaped seedpods. The abundance of this tree, especially in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, where it is prized for the shady relief it provides from the intense sun, coupled with its immensity, have made it a widely recognized species. It is the national tree of Costa Rica.In North America, it is often called elephant-ear tree, due to the shape of the seedpods. Other common names include devil's ear and earpod tree, parota, and orejón (Spanish) or'huanacaxtle (Nahuatl). In El Salvador, it is known as conacaste.[2] In the Yucatán peninsula, it is known by the Mayan name, pich. In Panama, it is known as a  corotú.The guanacaste is a medium-sized to large tree, growing to 25–35 m (82–115 ft) tall, with a  trunk up to 3.5 m (11 ft) in diameter. Unusual in a tree of these proportions, buttresses are completely lacking. The bark is light gray, with prominent dark reddish-brown, vertical fissures. In young trees, these fissures are closer together. and their confluence lends a characteristic reddish hue to the bark of guanacaste saplings. Older specimens often present broken, chipped, or scarred bark.The crown is broad and widely spreading. The height at which branches first occur along the trunk – as well as the overall tree shape – vary considerably among individuals and are habitat-dependent characteristics. Frequently, guanacaste trees grow as single specimens in a sunny pasture. Under these conditions, massive, extended, horizontal limbs emerge low on the boles, forming giant, hemispherical, widely spreading crowns. In the forest (where competition for light is intense), trees tend to become taller, and branching occurs at a higher level. Tree forms then become somewhat narrower, though crowns are still rounded, and hemispherical shapes are maintained by those that have reached the canopy.The alternate leaves are bipinnate compound, 15–40 cm (5.91–15.75 in) long and 17 cm (6.69 in) broad with a 2–6 cm (0.79–2.36 in) petiole bearing four to 15 pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 40–70 leaflets, the leaflets are slender, oblong, 8–15 mm (0.315–0.591 in) long by 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) wide. Near its base, the twiggy petiole bares a small, raised, oval gland. The leaves are confined to the outer shell of the crown, yet they are plentiful enough to make it moderately dense and green. The guanacaste is evergreen, or briefly deciduous for 1–2 months during the dry season. Most foliage is shed in December, at the start of the dry season. In late February, a growth surge is initiated that re-establishes a fresh, thick crown by April.Concurrent with the leaves' renewal is the appearance of globular inflorescences (3 cm (1.18 in)) in the axils of the new leaves. Supported by a long pedestal (4 cm (1.57 in)), each spherical white head – composed of about 50 individual flowers – sports thousands of thin, filamentous stamens as its major feature. The blossoms themselves each consist of about 20 stamens and a single pistil, bound together at the base by a short, green, tubular corolla and an even shorter calyx, just 5 mm (0.197 in) long altogether. Guanacaste flowers are very fragrant, and during intense flowering periods, their odor permeates the air for many meters in all directions. In Manuel Antonio National Park near Quepos, Costa Rica, flowering lasts from late February to early April.Surprisingly, no obvious fruiting activity immediately follows the decline of the blossom. Rather, 9-10 months pass before small, green pods first appear high in the crown by December. They reach full size by February and finally begin to ripen in March – a full year after flowering has ceased. Fruit ripening lasts from March to April, as the green pods turn brown in the guanacaste crown and are slowly shed. Vigorous trees produce large crops on a nearly annual basis. In June, guanacaste seedlings can already be seen, germinating in the moist soil of the early rainy season.Guanacaste fruits are large (7–12 cm (2.8–4.7 in) diameter), glossy dark brown indehiscent and spirally organized pods, shaped like orbicular disks. Their shape suggests the usual Mimosoideae fruit – a long, narrow, flattened pod – taken and wound around an axis perpendicular to its plane. Made of thick, soft tissue with a leathery feel, the pods contain eight to 20 radially arranged seeds, 14.5–17.5 mm (0.571–0.689 in) long, 7.8–11.2 mm (0.307–0.441 in) wide, and 6.2–7.2 mm (0.244–0.283 in) thick and weighing about 1 g. Guanacaste seeds are brown and marked with a conspicuous light brown or orange ring. They are very hard, resembling small stones rather than tree seeds in their strength and durability. For germination to occur, the hard seed coat must be broken to enable water to reach the embryo. Otherwise, the seeds lie dormant indefinitely.The ardillo (Cojoba arborea) and the iguano (Dilodendron costaricense) possess similar bipinnate leaves with extra-fine leaflets. Though of equally impressive stature, these two trees can be distinguished readily from the guanacaste, the ardillo has tan-colored, heavily wrinkled, and rough bark – nothing like the guanacaste's unmistakably gray and vertically cracked cortex. The iguano's leaflets are serrated (an unusual feature in a bipinnate tree), while those of the guanacaste are entire.Guanacaste trees appear to delay the onset of fruit development—some 9 months—so that seed maturation coincides with the start of the rainy season. This adaptive behavior presumably is an adaptation to give germinating seedlings as much time as possible to establish root systems before the start of the next dry season. Both the jatobá (Hymenaea courbaril) and the cenizaro (Albizia saman) exhibit similar reproductive strategies. Of course, guanacaste trees—like all deciduous and semideciduous species in this part of the world—share in the water-conserving benefits of dry-season leaflessness.Guanacaste flowers are heavily visited by bees—insects that probably are responsible for pollination, as well. Guanacaste seed pods, however, are completely ignored by native fauna and they accumulate on the forest floor underneath parent trees. The seeds are not eaten by any animals currently native where the tree occurs,[4] rendering the plant an evolutionary anachronism: it has been suggested that guanacaste pods were among the foods exploited by certain species of Pleistocene megafauna that became extinct some 10,000 years ago (e.g. giant ground sloths, giant bison).[5] Within this scenario, the tree remains today without an effective seed-dispersing vector besides humans.As discussed above, the tough-coated guanacaste seeds do not begin to grow unless their protective covers are punctured in some way. This may be an adaptation designed to keep the seeds from germinating while still in the pods at the start of the rainy season—and very likely still underneath the parent tree after having fallen from its crown. With more time to find them, foraging ground sloths (and other extinct mammals) could eat the pods and transport the seeds to a new site. The resulting mastication and digestion of the fruits would induce seed coat abrasion, which would help seed germination. Nowadays this role of mastication and dispersal has been taken up primarily by horses and cattle.[6]An insect pest, common to guanacaste trees of the Costa Rican Central Valley, produces spherical green galls of 1.5 cm (0.59 in) diameter on new shoots in February and March. Similar parasitism seems to occur on guanacaste trees of the wet, southwestern lowlands (around Palmar Sur).[7]The guanacaste is among the most majestic and aesthetically pleasing of tree species in its native range.[citation needed] Tolerant of a wide range of rainfall levels, temperatures, and soil conditions, they can thrive in most low-elevation, tropical habitats. Guanacaste trees are highly valued as ornamentals, and the shade they provide creates many an oasis on the searing and sun-baked plains in its Pacific slope habitat.It is widely grown as a shade tree to shelter coffee plantations and for shade and forage for cattle, it also improves soil fertility by nitrogen fixation.[8] The guanacaste is found in USDA Growth Zones 10–12.The wood is reddish-brown, lightweight (density 0.34–0.6 g/cm3 (0.20–0.35 oz/cu in)) and water-resistant, it is used to make items such as doors, windows, furniture, and cabinets, and for shipbuilding.[9] It is considered a relatively sustainable resource for wooden furniture and design projects, largely due to the tree's ability to quickly reach large sizes, which also makes it easier to find large natural cuts up to several meters, which is rare for other slower-growing woods, such as oak or cedar.[10] The town of La Cruz de Huanacaxtle in Nayarit (Mexico) derives its name from the fact that a cross used to stand there made of guanacaste wood.While the seed pods are still green, they are harvested and the seeds eaten boiled in Mexico.[8] Healthy guanacaste trees generate massive, nearly annual crops of seeds. The attractive seeds are used in Costa Rica to make jewelry.  In parts of Panama, the ripe seeds are heated in a fire until they pop like popcorn. These seeds demonstrate germination rates of nearly 100%. Guanacaste seedlings then grow rapidly, often reaching over 1 m (3 ft 3 in) in height in their first year. These aggressive reproductive characteristics might be beneficially exploited in reforestation projects, though the plant is considered an invasive species in some places.[11] Its roots are strong, and those of large trees may damage nearby structures.Guanacaste is commonly used to feed all kind of livestock, its foliage, fruits, and seeds are relished by cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, and horses.[12]The parota tree is believed to provide medical benefits. In Mexican folk medicine, the sap is thought to aid illnesses such as influenza and bronchitis, while the astringent properties of its green fruit are used for diarrhea. The fruit and bark also contain tannins, which are useful for leather curing and soap manufacturing, while the sap can be used as a natural adhesive or substitute for glue, or chewed as a type of gum.[13]The guanacaste has in the past been referred to by these junior synonyms:[14]"
2011 NHRA Full Throttle Drag Racing Series season;"The 2011 NHRA Full Throttle Drag Racing Season began on 24 February 2011 and concluded on 13 November. This race season marked the 60th anniversary of NHRA as an official motorsports sanctioning body.[1]There were 22 Top Fuel, Funny Car, and Pro Stock car events, and 16 Pro Stock Motorcycle events.1 The rules for the VisitMyrtleBeach.com 4 Wide Nationals differ from other races:Veteran Pro Stock driver Jeg Coughlin Jr. announced he is "stepping away" from the Pro Stock class for the 2011 season, electing to race instead in Sportsman classes. "We took most of 2006 off just to kind of have a break from it all," he said in his press release. "We did a lot of high-dollar bracket races and select Lucas Oil Sportsman Series events here and there with no particular schedule in mind. We kind of just raced when we wanted to and it was a lot of fun. That is the direction I am heading now."  Coughlin expects to spend more time with his school-age son Jeg Coughlin III at golf tournaments.[2]NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Kurt Busch (#22 Dodge Charger) obtained an NHRA Pro Stock license and debuted in competition at the Tire Kingdom Gatornationals in March, held during the NASCAR winter off-week.[3]Ashley Force Hood sat out the 2011 season, as she and husband Dan Hood were expecting their first child.  John Force Racing mechanic Mike Neff, who raced from late 2007 after replacing the late Eric Medlen after his fatal crash until 2009, returned to drive the Ford Mustang. Neff won the 2009 Auto Club Finals in his last start before returning to tuning John Force's car.[4]At the Fram/Autolite NHRA Nationals in Sonoma, CA, John Force qualified at the top of the Funny Car ladder. This gave Force 139 No. 1 qualifications for major events, besting the previous record holder, Pro Stock driver Warren Johnson, who holds 138 No. 1 qualifications as of 31 June 2011.[5]Two days after the 2011 season ended, six-time champion Kenny Bernstein announced his retirement from drag racing.[6] Just six days later, 2011 Top Fuel champion Del Worsham also retired, although he did win 8 races.[7]"

Indian Potash Limited;"Indian Potash Limited,[7][8][9] also known as IPL, is a fertiliser company based in India. It was incorporated under Indian Companies Act with the objective of import-handling, promotion and marketing of Potash in India. It imports, handles, promotes, and markets potash fertilisers in India. It sells fertilisers such as Muriate of Potash, Triple Super Phosphate, Monoammonium Phosphate, and Sulfate of Potash. The company was formerly known as Indian Potash Supply Agency and changed its name to Indian Potash Limited in 1970. The company was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in Chennai, India.[10] It is India's largest potash firm.[11]Indian Potash Limited was founded in 1955 as Indian Potash Supply Agency. After independence of India from British rule in 1947, there were a number of importers of Muriate of Potash (MOP) mainly for application on tea/coffee gardens and other plantation crops. In 1955 these importers formed a consortium for joint working and named it as Indian Potash Supply Agency (IPSA) for import and distribution of MOP across India. The main objective of IPSA was to create awareness among the farmers on the use of Potash.In 1970, IPSA was converted into Indian Potash Limited (IPL) and its equity base was expanded with Cooperative Sector, Fertiliser Companies in both Private and Public Sectors with major shares with Cooperative Sector.[12]Currently, Co-operative sector holds more than 70% of shares in the company and the largest shareholder is Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative with 33.99% holding. Other major shareholders are Gujarat, Andhra and Tamil Nadu State Co-Op Marketing Federation Cooperatives. Madras Fertilisers Limited is the largest Public sector shareholder in the company while Gujarat State Fertilisers and Chemical Limited is the largest shareholder from the Private sector.IPL is the largest importer of fertiliser in the country and second largest buyer of fertilisers in international market. IPL imports fertilisers through all the Indian ports and it is the only company in India which handles fertilisers throughout the year at all ports. The company is also active in production and marketing of Cattle Feed, dairy products, sugar and trading of precious metals (gold and silver).[13][14]In order to strengthen the relationship with farmers, the company has started production and marketing of Cattle Feed all over the country. They commenced the production and distribution of feeds from two plants one at Sikandrabad, Uttar Pradesh and another at Renigunta, Andhra Pradesh to meet the requirement of states in northern and southern India.IPL has footprint in Dairy industry as well. They have established one dairy plant in Kundli (Sonepat district), Haryana and another dairy plant at Sikandrabad in Uttar Pradesh. They work in close coordination with Mother Dairy to develop their dairy division.They have acquired five Sugar Units in Uttar Pradesh[15] during the financial year 2010-2011. The company is also working on two joint venture products namely Green Field Port Facility on Gujarat coast and an Integrated Sugar Complex with Co-generation and Distillery in Bihar.[16]The total volume sales of all products during the year 2015-16 stood at 7.8 million tonnes. MOP or Muriate of Potash is the flagship product of the company and was able to achieve sales of 2.78 million tonnes in the year 2015-16.The total revenue of the Company during the year 2015-16 was at INR 16,650.23 crores. The Company earned a Pre-tax Profit of INR 247.47 crores and Net Profit of INR 161.91 crores."
Sara Nelson (editor);"Sara Nelson is an American publishing industry figure who is an editor and book reviewer and consultant[1] and columnist,[2] and is currently the editorial director at Amazon.com.[3] Nelson is notable for having been editor in chief at the book industry's chief trade publication Publishers Weekly from 2005–2009 during a time of wrenching restructuring and industry downsizing. After that, she was book editor at Oprah's O Magazine. Her book So Many Books, So Little Time was published in 2003.[4] Her views have been widely reported in numerous publications such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, and she has appeared on television broadcasts including CBS's The Early Show. She has written for the Wall Street Journal and the Huffington Post[5] about publishing industry trends and has been described as a "lively presence within the book publishing industry."[2] She is an extensive reader[6] and has been described as a "lover of books."[7]Nelson graduated from Yale in 1978 and Phillips Academy in Andover  in 1974.[8] She wrote about books and publishing at the New York Post, the New York Observer, Glamour magazine, and held editorial positions at Self, Inside.com, and Book Publishing Report.[2] Nelson married and had a child and is a fierce advocate for respect for working mothers.[9] Women struggled with ways to juggle careers and families, and stay-at-home moms and working mothers jostled over women's roles in the home, sometimes termed in the media as the Mommy Wars. Nelson wrote:One morning one of the stay-at-home mothers referred to herself, quite pointedly, as a full-time mom. Those three words made my blood boil. I've been a mother every second of every day for the past ten and a half years. -- Sara Nelson in 2006[9]Nelson, based on a New Year's plan, embarked on an ambitious project to read one book each week and write about it, and the effort morphed into a book entitled So Many Books, So Little Time: A Year of Passionate Reading which was published by Putnam in 2003.[10] While her initial book–a–week plan fell apart almost immediately, according to New York Times book reviewer Ihsan Taylor, the effort was fruitful since the book was seen as a commentary on the "nature of reading itself."[11] Nelson's future employer, Publishers Weekly, reported that her book revealed her "infectious enthusiasm for literature in general."[12] Writer Augusten Burroughs said Nelson's book was a "smart, witty, utterly original memoir about how every book becomes a part of us."[13]Nelson has been a consistent heavy reader throughout her life, and at one point, in a YouTube interview, said that she typically reads about 50 books cover–to–cover per year regardless of her self-imposed commitment. She will only write about a book after she's read it completely, according to Nelson in the interview. Further, she reads portions of many books which are sent to her or recommended by others, sometimes only the first ten pages. She favors fiction over non-fiction generally, occasionally reading classics overlooked during her college years, and some non-fiction works such as David McCullough's treatment of American president John Adams.[12]Nelson became editor–in–chief of the trade magazine Publishers Weekly in January 2005.[7] It was a powerful position since the magazine is traditionally regarded as a standard bearer for mainstream critical opinion regarding books. A positive review from Publishers Weekly can bring a big sales boost to an unknown title, and the editor–in–chief's opinion about new books has considerable weight in the publishing industry. New York Times reporter Edward Wyatt suggested that the top job at Publishers Weekly in 2005 involved facing "many challenges".[7]In her new position, Nelson added a new assessment for books called a signature review.[14] She permitted greater variety in the length of reviews (typically 200 to 500 words long), considered bylines to reviews, and changes to the magazine's cover format.[7] She hired graphic designer Jean-Claude Suares, added color using so-called drop down shadows behind color book covers, and wrote an editorial each week. She switched the magazine's logo to use the two letters PW since the abbreviation was well understood within the publishing world. She developed a nominating board of several thousand booksellers and librarians to nominate books for prizes in nineteen different categories, readers voted for books within stores or online, and the awards were termed the Quill awards. There was increased use of a foldout advertisement on the front cover, with the theme repeated inside the table of contents page.The first decade of the new century was marked by turbulence within the industry as well as a continuing trend away from serious writing and towards pop culture. Publishers Weekly had enjoyed a "near monopoly" over the past decades but was getting vigorous competition from Internet sites, e-mail newsletters and daily newspapers.[7] The industry was consolidating. Many independent booksellers—a mainstay of Publishers Weekly clientele—were going out of business.[7] Paid circulation dropped by 3,000 to 25,000 in the mid-2000s.[7] Nelson pushed for significant changes towards modernization, greater use of the Web, and more focus on analytical reporting.[7]Nelson commented in an interview about how she saw PW evolving:The distinction between a trade publication and a general-interest or consumer magazine is becoming ever more blurred ... The magazine might not be for everybody who buys books ... But I do think there is a good size civilian population that is fascinated by books and the book business. Find a group of three people, and two of them want to be writers or have a book idea. Everyone I know belongs to a book group. There is a crossover population that we should be able to add to the mix without sacrificing our appeal to people in the book business.-- Sara Nelson, 2005[7]Nelson, looking at business practices within the book publishing industry, saw problems. She speculated that the industry practice of printing too many books to "kind of create a buzz" and then having to ship books back from bookstores was inefficient.[15] She saw a trend favoring so-called big books at the expense of lesser known writers:... increasingly ... the book business is not about finding and nurturing authors or building audiences and careers. It's about opening big and making a splash. Bring me a big book, more than one editor has told more than one agent more than once in the past 20 years. ... Everybody knows that the book business is hurting, that money is tight, that layoffs are rampant. A risky time to be throwing money around. Still, publishers keep looking for the big score. Mere weeks after hundreds of editors, publicists, marketers and the like were cut from the rolls of publishing houses across the country, a group of editors from the major houses boarded a plane to Los Angeles to woo their next potential big author: Britney Spears. The opening bid: a reported $5 million. We don't know yet which of them won this compelling project, but I know that somebody will.--Sara Nelson.[16]In 2008, Nelson commented on the intersection of political candidates, books, and television celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, not knowing that the talk show celebrity would be her employer within a year. There were several dozen books about then-candidate Obama.[17] Nelson was interviewed on National Public Radio on Winfrey's influence,[18] similar to that of radio personality Imus,[19] in the publishing arena.[20] She described Oprah:The television star is the most influential -- not to mention the wealthiest -- African American woman in the country. Consider the millions who watch her show, read her magazine and follow her advice. Winfrey is more than just a powerful influence. She is practically the nation's life coach. So, if she tells people to vote for the candidate, people will vote for that candidate, right? After all, many political analysts are saying, she has done something far more difficult: On dozens of occasions, she has turned middling successful books into huge bestsellers. (Think Cormac McCarthy's The Road and James Frey's A Million Little Pieces, to name just two.) But using this bestseller-yardstick to gauge Oprah's influence on politics is a bit misguided. The thing is you don't have to sell nearly as many books as get votes in order to crown a winner. -- Sara Nelson, 2008.[5]After a profound economic downturn beginning in 2007 and lasting for the next few years, the publishing industry slumped significantly. Nelson commented in 2008 how layoffs and salary freezes were "sobering".[21]Nelson wrote about such industry topics as Twitter writers signing book deals,[22] Jonathan Littell's controversial 1,000 page Holocaust novel,[16] and realignments of publishing firms.[23] Nelson was quoted about sleeper hit books such as Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen[24] as well as an expansion of what's considered to be chick lit which has grown to be more accomplished and "grown up," according to Nelson.[25] She commented on trends in changing technology, such as the coming of digital books such as Amazon's Kindle.[1] She owns a Kindle[6] and a Sony Reader and sees both as a "statement to the world that you like to read."[26] She said:Publishers are going to be confronted with the idea that either the words on the page have to be completely compelling on their own, or they have to figure out a way to create new sorts of subliminal draws in the new medium ... If you are going to put video in a book, it has to flow so naturally into the story that readers don't even realize they are switching mediums.--Sara Nelson in 2009.[1]Nelson identified other trends. Fewer places review books now, unfortunately, but there is more information available to consumers who may not want in-depth literary reviews of a book, rather, they want to know whether it's worth plunking down $25, and that's it.[6] In some respects, according to Nelson, smaller publishers are better off than large houses which have huge budgets devoted to overhead, for example, Nelson said a small "mom and pop" publisher can do five books a year and be profitable.[6] She still thinks it's tough times for people employed within the industry, she said "You can do all the right things and still lose your job."[6] She thinks business-to-business magazines will become available mostly online, and soon.[6] In the past, self publishing was seen as the "exclusive realm of egomaniacs, eccentrics, and failures," according to a reporter in the Los Angeles Times, but over the past decade or so it's become more popular and somewhat better accepted.[27] Nelson commented in 2010 that there were more instances of publishers picking up a self-published book, although such success stories are still rare.[27] "Publishers are taking self-published books more seriously," she said.[27]Then, in 2009, Nelson was dismissed from Publishers Weekly. She said:I feel like it was a great run and I am very proud of the changes that my staff and I have made. I am sorry that the magazine and I are parting ways.--Sara Nelson[2]The action sent shockwaves through the industry and was widely covered in prominent newspapers.[28] There was considerable reaction by readers as well. One reader wrote: "Sara Nelson turned Publishers Weekly around!"[2] Another wrote that "Sara Nelson pulled Publishers Weekly into the 21st century with grace, verve, and panache. And I've never met such a loud cheerleader for books and for the book publishing industry."[2]In September 2009, Nelson was appointed book editor at Oprah's O Magazine.[29][30][31] She continued to comment in the media about new forces in publishing such as the new quarterly literary magazine called Electric Literature which allows readers to read in a variety of media, including e-book, iPhone, and audiobook.[32] Nelson applauded the effort saying that "anything that takes the starch out" was good.[32] Generally, Nelson's outlook for the publishing industry is bright and thinks that "in the end readers will win."[33] Sara Nelson appeared with Harry Smith of CBS News on The Early Show.[34] She's also served as moderator for events sponsored by the LA Times Festival of Books.[35]"
High-voltage transformer fire barriers;"High-voltage transformer fire barriers, or transformer firewalls, transformer ballistic firewalls, transformer blast walls, are outdoor countermeasures against cascading failures in a national electric grid. The purpose of these barriers, like common fire barriers in building construction, is compartmentalisation of transformer fires, and compartmentalisation of transformer and bushing explosions―in which the fuel source of both fires and explosions is the transformer oil. Without compartmentalisation, one ruptured transformer could start its neighbouring transformer on fire and thus create a domino effect that would affect the surrounding electric grid, particularly during peak times. High-voltage transformer fire barriers are typically located in electrical substations, but may also be attached to buildings, such as valve halls or manufacturing plants with large electrical distribution systems, such as pulp and paper mills. Outdoor transformer fire barriers that are attached at least on one side to a building are referred to as wing walls. At times, high-voltage transformers can be located immediately outside and sometimes inside of buildings, requiring higher fire-resistance ratings than other fire compartments in a building.[1]The primary North American document that deals with outdoor high-voltage transformer fire barriers is NFPA 850.[2] NFPA 850 outlines that outdoor oil-insulated transformers should be separated from adjacent structures and from each other by firewalls, spatial separation, or other approved means for the purpose of limiting the damage and potential spread of fire from a transformer failure.The following may be used in place of or in addition to transformer fire barriers, depending on the design goals. Fire protection water spray systems are used to cool a transformer to prevent damage if exposed to radiation heat transfer from a fire involving oil released from another transformer that has failed.[3]Passive mechanical systems designed to depressurize the transformer a few milliseconds after the occurrence of an electrical fault.[4] Those systems minimize the chance that a transformer tank will rupture given a minor fault but are not effective on major internal faults.[5]Transformer oil is available in different levels of ignitability, including those approved by FM Global.[6] FM Data Sheet 5-4 indicates different levels of protection depending on the type of fluid used. Alternatives include, but are not limited to, esters and silicone oil.[7]"

List of Phi Kappa Psi Grand Arch Councils;"Phi Kappa Psi, also called "Phi Psi", is an American collegiate social fraternity founded at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on February 19, 1852. There are over a hundred chapters and colonies at accredited four year colleges and universities throughout the United States.[1] More than 112,000 members have been initiated into Phi Kappa Psi since its founding.[1]The supreme governing body of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity is the Grand Arch Council (G.A.C.). The first convened in 1855. G.A.C.s then convened at an irregular schedule until an entirely new form of government was ratified in 1886.[2] Beginning in 1888, nearly all G.A.C.s have been regularly scheduled and have occurred biennially with two exceptions, those being that of the 1944 G.A.C. which was cancelled due to World War II, and the 2020 G.A.C. which was cancelled due to the Coronavirus Pandemic.[3]"
Region 6 War Room;"The Region 6 War Room is a nuclear bunker dating from the early days of the cold war, on the Whiteknights Park campus of the University of Reading in the English town of Reading. It is one of a number of such Regional War Rooms built during the 1950s and designed to co-ordinate civil defence in the event of an attack on the country using conventional bombs or atom bombs.[1]In the event of war, the war room would have housed the Regional Commissioner and his staff who would have directed the strategic response to air raids throughout the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Dorset, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, and the Isle of Wight. The Regional Commissioner had the authority to assume the full powers of the central government in this region if contact with central government was lost.[1][2]The war room takes the form of a two level windowless building, with the upper level being above ground level and protected by massive concrete walls, while the lower level is below ground level. The building is surmounted by towers containing filtration equipment. The bunker was designed to cope with attacks by weapons of the type used during the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.[1]The development of the hydrogen bomb and the expectation of mutually assured destruction meant that the war room was both inadequately protected, and seen as too small to support the large live-in staff that would be needed after a major nuclear strike. Its principal responsibilities were transferred to a new Regional Seat of Government RSG-6 at Warren Row near Maidenhead. Some sources suggest that it continued in use as a civil defence communications centre for some period after this transfer.[1]After ceasing to be used for civil defence purposes, the war room was taken over by the University and modified as a secure storage facility for use by the University Library. The building still exists, and can be found to the rear of the Department of Agriculture building, near the Earley Gate to the University's Whiteknights Campus. There is no public access to the interior of the building.[citation needed]In the University's updated development plan announced in autumn 2007, the bunker was marked as being scheduled for demolition, along with the wartime 'temporary office buildings'. The land was to be used for a car park.[3]However, in March 2009, the threatened building received a Grade II heritage listing and is now protected.[4]"

Fasil Ghebbi;"The Fasil Ghebbi (Amharic: ፋሲል ግቢ) is a fortress  located in Gondar, Amhara Region,  Ethiopia. It was founded in the 17th century by Emperor Fasilides and was the home of Ethiopian emperors. Its unique architecture shows diverse influences including Nubian, Indian, Arab, and Baroque characteristics.[1] Because of its historical importance and architecture, the fortress was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.[1] Ghebbi is an Amharic word for a compound or enclosure.[2]The complex of buildings includes Fasilides' castle, Iyasu I's palace, Dawit III's Hall, Empress Mentewab's castle, a chancellery and library from Yohannes I, a banqueting hall from the emperor Bakaffa, stables, and three churches: Asasame Qeddus Mikael, Elfign Giyorgis and Gemjabet Mariyam.[1]The origins of the Fasil Ghebbi can be found in the old tradition of Ethiopian emperors traveling around their possessions, living off the produce of the peasants and dwelling in tents. Reflecting this connection, this precinct was frequently referred to as a katama ("camp" or "fortified settlement") or makkababya, the name applied to the imperial camp in the Royal Chronicle of Baeda Maryam.[3]Emperor Fasilides broke with this tradition of progressing through the territories, and founded the city of Gondar as his capital, its relative permanence makes the city historically important.[1] Within the capital, he commanded the construction of an imposing edifice, the Fasil Gemb or Fasilides castle. The area around the Fasil Gemb was delineated by a wall with numerous gates. Subsequent emperors built their own structures, many of which survive either in whole or part today.[4] Visiting the Fasil Ghebbi in the late 1950s, Thomas Pakenham observed that "dotted among the palaces are what remains of the pavilions and kiosks of the imperial city".[5]The original buildings were influenced by Nubian, Arab, and Indian architectural design, with later Baroque Architectural styling introduced by Jesuit Missionaries[1]A large number of the buildings at Fasil Ghebbi did not survive the events of the time, but the place is still rich in buildings that were renovated both by the Italian occupiers in the late 1930s and after Ethiopia regained its independence. The site was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979, which stated in its decision that it faithfully represents modern Ethiopian civilization at north of Lake Tana which appeared in the early 17th century and influenced Ethiopian architecture for many years. Fasil Ghebbi also includes the Fasilides Baths, a construction which is also attributed to Emperor Fasilides, and the Imperial Complex [am] of Empress Mantawab [am] in Kuskam, which is considered one of the most important tourist destinations in the country.Fasil Ghebbi covers an area of about 70,000 square meters. To its south lies Adababay, the market place of Gondar, where imperial proclamations were made, troops presented, and criminals executed, it is currently a city park.[6]Dawit's Hall is in the northern part of the enclosure, adjacent to the building attributed to Bakaffa and the church of Asasame Qeddus Mikael. Often referred to as the "House of Song", Munro-Hay notes that this may be due to a misreading of the Amharic zofan bet ("House of the Divan" or "House of the Throne") as zafan bet ("House of Song"). Munro-Hay describes it as a "substantial one-storey building with a round tower at the southeast corner", with traces of a smaller round tower at  the northeast corner and traces of a square tower at the northwest corner "most of which has collapsed." The interior of the building is a single long hall, which "the usual arched windows and doorways provided light and access". As of 2002[update], Dawit's Hall lacks a roof.[7]Fasil Ghebbi is enclosed by a 900-meter-long curtain wall which is pierced by twelve gates. These are, in counter-clockwise order: Fit Ber (also called Jan Tekle Ber) opening onto Adababay, Wember Ber (Gate of the Judges), Tazkaro Ber (Gate of Funeral Commemoration), which had a bridge destroyed by fighting during the reign of Iyasu II, Azaj Tequre Ber (Gate of Azaj Tequre), which once was connected by a bridge to Adababay Tekle Haymanot church, Adenager Ber (Gate of the Spinners), which was linked by a bridge to Qeddus Rafael church in the weaver's section of Gondar, Qwali Ber (Gate of the Queen's Attendants), next to the modern entrance to Elfin Giyorgis church inside the Enclosure, Imbilta Ber (Gate of the Musicians), Elfign Ber (Gate of the Privy Chamber), which gave access to the private apartments of the Fasil Ghebbi, Balderas Ber (Gate of the Commander of the Cavalry), Ras Ber (Gate of the Ras), also known as Qwarenyoch Ber (Gate of the Qwara people), Ergeb Ber (Gate of Pigeons), also known as Kechin Ashawa Ber (Gate of the Gifts), Inqoye Ber (Gate of Princess Inqoye, the mother of Empress Mentewab, and Gimjabet Mariyam Ber (Gate of the Treasury of Mary), which leads to the churchyard of Gimjabet Mariyam church.[8]Side entrance to Fasil GembInterior of Fasilides' PalacePalace of Iyasu IPalace of Iyasu IRoyal library buildingRoyal archive buildingThe Zamani Project documented  Fasil Ghebbi in the center of Gondar with terrestrial 3D laser scanning.[9][10][11] The structures documented include:  the Castle of Emperor Fasilides, the Bakaffa Castle, Dawit III’s Hall, the Castle of Emperor Iyasu, the Royal Library, the Chancellery, the Royal Archive Building .Some of the textured 3D models, a panorama tour, elevations, sections and plans are available on www.zamaniproject.org."

Staniša Radonjić;"Staniša Radonjić (Serbian Cyrillic: Станиша Радоњић), known as Staniša Popov (Станиша Попов, fl. 1682 - 1693), was a Serbian Orthodox priest, chieftain (vojvoda) of the Njeguši tribe, and Serdar of the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro.Staniša was born the son of a priest (hence popov), of the Radonjić-Rajićević brotherhood.[1] He is believed to have been first mentioned in the mid-17th century as living in Njeguši.[2] He was a priest,[3] and the chieftain (vojvoda) of the Njeguši tribe.[4] In 1682, he gave the mitre (a ceremonial head-dress for bishops), which he had paid for to be done,[3] to the treasury of Cetinje as a gift to Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan Visarion Borilović (s. 1674–1692).[5] In 1687, Staniša gained notability in trade relations with Kotor,[6] which at the time was part of the Republic of Venice. That year Staniša and Ivan Maričević obliged to the Kotoran court that they would purchase fine wool within ten days from the receival of 435 reals from captain Bernardo Paulucci.[6] On 8 September 1693, he is mentioned (as Stanissa Popov del Comune di Gnegussi) in the agreement between the Katun tribes and the Venetian government (the Dalmatian provveditore) in Kotor.[3] In 1700, Staniša became creditor to the Venetian Republic.[6]In 1697, Danilo Šćepčević of the Petrović-Heraković brotherhood of Njeguši[1] was appointed Metropolitan of Cetinje.  This marked the beginning of what is known in modern historiography as the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro under the hereditary Metropolitans of Cetinje of the Petrović family.  It is believed that Metropolitan Danilo adopted the title of serdar in his government in 1718 when he appointed "guvernaduri and some serdari and knezovi ... to judge and discipline the people".[2] Of this appointed serdar, Staniša is the only one known in historiography.[7] In the beginning, Staniša was only the serdar of a nahija, however, thanks to the prominence of his family and relations to the Venetians, he seized the title as the title of serdar of all of Montenegro.[7] His seal, found in Venetian archives, reads "Staniša, the priest's son, serdar of Montenegro" (»staniša popov srdar černie gori«).[8] As Staniša became serdar and the title became hereditary to the Radonjić brotherhood, the Njeguši tribe was led by the serdar instead of the earlier vojvoda.[4] Later, the significance of the "serdar of all Montenegro" fell, and it remained as a traditional function of a manager, now under the name of guvernadur.[7]He died in ca. 1720. He had three sons: Vukoslav (Vukosav), Jovan (Jovo) and Marko.[citation needed] After him, his son Vuk, his grandson Stano and his great-grandson Vukolaj III held the position of guvernadur until 1832.[citation needed]On the right central icon of Jesus Christ with the apostles in the church of Holy Mary (sv. Gospođa) on Njeguši, the work of Maksim Tujković from 1720, it mentions the children of Staniša: Vukosav, Jovo and Marko. In that same church, Staniša is mentioned in an inscription by Rafailo Dimitrijević from 1756.In the folk song about the events from the historical period encompassing his tenure as Serdar c. 1719, the words Stanišić Tower and Stanišić Vuk are mentioned.He had three sons:Од тих изабраних сердара нама је познат само сердар Станиша. Према томе он је упочетку био само нахиски сердар, али благодарећи истакнутости своје породице и везама с Млечанима он је приграбио ту титулу као титулу ..."

Lawrence Sidbury;"Lawrence Sidbury, Jr. (born February 6, 1986) is a former American football defensive end. He played college football at Richmond and was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the fourth round of the 2009 NFL Draft.Sidbury was born in Cheltenham, Maryland and attended Oxon Hill High School in Oxon Hill, Maryland. While there, he was a three-year starter on the football team and served as a team captain for his final two seasons. As a senior in 2004, Sidbury earned All-State, honorable mention All-Met, All-County, and All-League honors. He earned a position on the Washington, D.C. Golden 11 Team and played in the Prince George's County All-Star Game.[1]In high school, he was an honor roll student in the science and vo-tech program. He also competed in track & field and finished second in the state in shot put.[1]Sidbury spent his true freshman year on redshirt status. In 2005, he played in 13 games including one start, and recorded 24 tackles including four for loss, and three sacks for 12 yards. Sidbury played as part of the Richmond defense which was ranked fourth in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) and 38th nationally, allowing a total of 339.3 yards per game. Richmond was ranked 22nd in the nation against the rush, allowing 120.1 yards per game on the ground.[1]In 2006, Sidbury saw action in nine games.

Mary Lily Kenan Flagler Bingham;"Mary Lily Kenan Flagler Bingham (1867-1917) was an American philanthropist and heiress who became notorious when she married one of the richest men of the Gilded Age. Mary Lily outlived her first husband, Henry Flagler and inherited his huge fortune, married again three years later, and died under suspicious circumstances at aged fifty. She left the millions she inherited to members of her family and to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Before she became famous and extraordinarily wealthy, Mary Lily grew up in an affluent household. She was the daughter of William Rand Kenan Sr and Mary Hargrave Kenan,[1] Mary Lily was born in Duplin County, on June 14, 1867.  When she was little, her father was a life insurance agent.[2] By the late 1870s, her family lived in Wilmington, North Carolina[3]  Mary Lily attended Amy Bradley’s Tileston school in Wilmington.[4] Mary Lily was well-educated for a woman in the late 19th century: she both attended school in Wilmington, and attended Peace College in Raleigh.[4]  Kenan was also well known for her musical abilities and according to one account, she was North Carolina’s “reigning belle” because of her vivaciousness, beauty, and accomplishments.[4] By this time, Mary Lily had become well acquainted with some of the richest members of Wilmington society.  She traveled with the Mr. and Mrs. Pembroke Jones and became socially intimate with the Jones’ friend, Henry Walters, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Henry Flagler.[4]Mary Lily Kenan married the much-older Henry Morrison Flagler in 1901. She was his third wife. Henry Morrison Flagler was 72 years old. She was 34, but it wasn’t only the age gap that scandalized the nation. In order to marry Mary Lily, Henry Morrison Flagler had to obtain a divorce from his second wife, who had become mentally ill over the course of their marriage.[5] In order to obtain a divorce, he changed his legal residence to Florida, and persuaded the Florida legislature to allow divorce on the grounds of insanity.[5] He was criticized for this action. According to the Goldsboro Argus  “A Man who would thus cast off an aged wife, blameless herself, is simply beyond execration.”[6]When the couple married in 1901 in Duplin County, Flagler gave Mary Lily Kenan “…a check for $1,000,000, and $3,000,000 in bonds as a wedding present.”[7] After their marriage, Henry lavished gifts and attention on Mary Lily. Henry built Whitehall, a “….75-room, 100,000-square-foot Gilded Age mansion…as a wedding present for his wife, Mary Lily Kenan Flagler. The couple used the home as a winter retreat from 1902 until Flagler's death in 1913, establishing the Palm Beach season for the wealthy of the Gilded Age.”[8]Henry Flagler died in 1913, and passed the majority of his wealth on to Mary Lily. Three years later, Mary Lily married a college friend of her brother’s, who she’d dated before in the 1890s. She and Judge Robert Worth Bingham married in New York City, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Pembroke Jones in 1916.[9] This second marriage did not last long. Mary Lily Kenan Flagler Bingham died in July 1917.[10]Mary Lily Kenan Bingham’s death also sparked scandal and controversy.  Mary Lily died after a short illness, and, according to the Wilmington Morning Star, “…the news of her death produced a profound shock in the family and among many friends in the city and in other cities of the State…”[11] Mary Lily was buried on July 31, 1917, after a service in the residence of Mary Lily’s sister Sarah.[12]  The shock of Mary Lily’s death seems to have quickly turned to suspicion about how she died. Headlines spoke of a “tragic mystery,” “foul play” and “murder” and seemed to imply that Mary Lily’s husband may have had something to do with her death.[13][14][15] Before they married, Judge Bingham waived his rights to the Flagler fortune and most of the estate was left to Mary Lily’s birth family members.[4] Judge Bingham did receive $5 million, and some of the concerns about him seems to have stemmed from this inheritance, which was a late addition to Mary Lily’s will.[16]So rather than remaining at rest in Oakdale Cemetery, Mary Lily Kenan Flagler Bingham’s body was exhumed in September 1917, with armed guards stationed around the gravesite as her body was dug up in the night.[13] The autopsy was requested by Graham Kenan, Mary Lily’s sister Sarah’s husband, not Robert Bingham.[17] Despite these irregularities and mysterious circumstances, no charges were ever levied against anyone in the matter of Mrs. Bingham’s death.  Bingham went on to be an ambassador to England in the 1930s, and parlayed Mary Lily’s money into a newspaper empire.[18] The results of the autopsy were never released. Rumors of drug use, alcoholism, and murder have swirled around the life of Mary Lily Kenan Flagler Bingham ever since.[19][18][4]The estate left was vast – “…estimated to be worth all the way from $65,000,000 to $130,000,000.” [20]Mary Lily’s marriage to Henry Flagler helped make her entire family extremely wealthy.  William R. Kenan Jr. and her sisters Jessie Kenan Wise and Sarah Graham Kenan and niece Louise Wise, were all recipients of her will’s largess.  So was the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  While Mary Lily Kenan attended Peace College at a time when women were not admitted to the University of North Carolina, one of her greatest legacies is the Kenan Professorship Fund, to which she donated $1.875 million dollars in honor of her male family members who attended the college.[21] Mary Lily’s legacy of giving to UNC was enhanced by the actions of her brother William and her sister Sarah, who both donated generously to UNC after they inherited millions from their sister."

2019 Melilla Assembly election;"Juan José ImbrodaPPEduardo de CastroCsThe 2019 Melilla Assembly election was held on Sunday, 26 May 2019, to elect the 7th Assembly of the Autonomous City of Melilla. All 25 seats in the Assembly were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in at least seven autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain, as well as the 2019 European Parliament election.The Assembly of Melilla is the top-tier administrative and governing body of the autonomous city of Melilla. Voting for the Assembly is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered and residing in the municipality of Melilla and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allows Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty.[2][3][4]The 25 members of the Assembly of Melilla are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 5 percent of valid votes—which includes blank ballots—being applied. Parties not reaching the threshold are not taken into consideration for seat distribution.[2][3][4]The Mayor-President is indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause requires that mayoral candidates earn the vote of an absolute majority of members, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly shall be automatically appointed to the post. In case of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee.[4]The electoral law provides that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors are allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors are required to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in Melilla. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called.[2][3]The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The "Lead" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll. When available, seat projections determined by the polling organisations are displayed below (or in place of) the percentages in a smaller font, 13 seats were required for an absolute majority in the Assembly of Melilla."

The owner cited lack of facilities at the zoo due to this fire, which prevented him from putting up a permanent sign on Capital Boulevard, as one of many factors that led to the lack of funds for the zoo and its eventual closure.[48]Seibel closed the zoo in February 2006, citing money and personal problems, as well as encroaching development that would require him to fence the entire property.[54][55] After the zoo closed, the Bengal tiger Raja, who Seibel and staff had rescued from neglectful owners, was moved to the Carnivore Preservation Trust in Pittsboro, North Carolina after having first been quarantined at the North Carolina Zoo.[56][57] Other animals were transferred to various private collections and zoos.[54]The zoo was home to some 500 animals representing 85 species.[55][58] Mammals at the zoo included a Bengal tiger, blackbuck, Himalayan moon bears, camels, capybara, caracals, coati, donkeys, fallow deer, red kangaroos, lemurs, lions, llama, scimitar oryx, muntjac, sloths, servals, and zebras. Birds included chickens, sarus cranes, red-crowned cranes, blue-and-gold macaws, scarlet macaws, military macaws, doves, emu, ostriches, pheasants, pigeons, toucans. Reptiles included leopard geckos, bearded dragons, and various species of skinks and snakes.[58]In 1995 the Upper Clements Wildlife Park opened near the tourist town of Annapolis Royal in Upper Clements, Nova Scotia, Canada. In 2007 the wildlife park and an adjacent Upper Clements Theme Park were purchased by non-profit Upper Clements Parks Society. In 2010 the Wildlife Park was closed.[59] In 2012, the Upper Clements Adventure Park was opened adjacent to Upper Clements Theme Park to form Upper Clements Parks.[60]Van Kleef Aquarium was located in Singapore.Walk in the Wild was located in what is now the city of Spokane Valley, Washington, United States, but which was an unincorporated area of Spokane County at the time. It operated from 1972 to 1995, becoming the second zoo to fail in the area after Manito (above) in 1932. Attendance peaked in the early 1990s, and the zoo even included rare snow leopards for a time. Nevertheless, there were financial and public relations struggles throughout its history, and it closed after failing to get enough funding from the county and donations. The grounds were turned into Mirabeau Point Park and a local YMCA.[34]Wanneroo Lion Park, formerly Bullen's African Lion Safari Park, was an open-range zoo in Carabooda, in the north of Perth, Western Australia.[61] It operated for 17 years, between 1971 and 1988.[62]Wassenar Zoo (or Dierenpark Wassenaar) was just off the highway from Amsterdam to The Hague in Wassenaar, Netherlands, about 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) from the Hague. The zoo was opened in 1937 and closed on 1 December 1985. The buildings were abandoned but still standing as of 2010.[63][64]Wheeler Park Zoo was located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. Park land was donated to the city in 1902 by James B. Wheeler. A local man donated a deer to the park, and other donations in the form of pets and wild-caught animals followed. The resulting menagerie was first called "the zoo" by the Daily Oklahoman on August 19, 1903. The zoo had problems with flooding, and the animals were eventually moved to a new facility in Lincoln Park in 1920.[65]Windsor Safari Park was a popular family attraction built on St. Leonards Hill on the outskirts of the English town of Windsor in Berkshire, it has since been converted into the site of Legoland Windsor. Billed as "The African Adventure", the park included drive-through animal enclosures, aviaries, a dolphinarium and minor theme park rides.Former zoo located at Wyndham, Western Australia which specialized in displaying Crocodiles. The park closed in 2014.The Zoo at Nay Aug was located in Nay Aug Park in Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States. It once hosted the famous Tilly the elephant and Joshua the donkey. The zoo closed in 1988, and the newest elephant Toni was shipped to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. in 1989. The zoo remained closed until summer 2003, when it reopened as a smaller wildlife rehabilitation center. In an article in Time magazine, this zoo in 2008 was the 4th worst animal treatment (abuse) zoo in America. In 2009 the zoo once again closed, due to public outcry over conditions, with the site being given to Lackawanna College to use as a natural research center.Zoo Labyrinth Boekelo was in Enschede in the province of Overijssel, the Netherlands. It opened in 2005,[66] and included a series of labyrinths and mazes to test the senses and help teach about nature. It also included a butterfly garden.[67][68] The zoo was closed in 2012.Zoo Nebraska was a zoo located in Royal, Nebraska, United States. It closed in June 2007 after a 2005 incident where three Chimpanzees escaped and were shot dead by its director.[69][70][71]The Zoological Garden of Hamburg (German: Zoologischer Garten zu Hamburg) was a zoo in Hamburg, Germany that operated from 1863 until 1930.  Its aquarium, which opened in 1864, was among the first in the world.Zological Garden of Faliro (Greek:Ζωολογικός κήπος του Φαλήρου) was the first Zoo in Greece. It opened at 1901 in Athens by Nikolas Germanos. Faliro zoo was home for animals like lions, tigers, bears, giraffes, ostriches, exotic birds, orangutans, cheetahs and other animals. Some of the animals were the first ever seen by the people in Athens, who were negative to the zoo at first, but soon it became a favourite destination. It closed in 1916 because of WW1 and other problems."

He started the 2014 season with the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats, and was promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on June 12.[15] He struggled with control, issuing 17 walks in 321⁄3 Triple-A innings, and on July 17, it was announced that he would be moved to the bullpen.[16] On July 22, he was called up to the Major League club.[17]On July 22, 2014, it was announced that Sanchez had been promoted to the Toronto Blue Jays to pitch out of the bullpen.[18] He made his debut on July 23, pitching 2 innings and recording 2 strikeouts against the Boston Red Sox.[19] On July 27, Sanchez earned his first Major League win, pitching 2 innings against the New York Yankees.

After Marcus Stroman suffered a torn left ACL on March 10, Sanchez pitched in the rotation for the rest of spring training and earned the fifth starter spot to open the season.[22] He recorded his first win as a starter on April 22, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 4–2. Sanchez pitched 51⁄3 innings and yielded two runs on two hits and seven walks with four strikeouts. In winning, he became the first Toronto pitcher to win despite issuing seven walks since Jeff Ware in 1995.[23] On May 8, Sanchez shutout the Boston Red Sox over seven innings, recording his first quality start.

In addition to setting a career-high in innings pitched, Sanchez did not walk a batter for the first time as a starter.[25] After missing his next scheduled start with upper body soreness, Sanchez was placed on the disabled list on June 14, retroactive to June 6, with a strained lat muscle.[26] On July 19, manager John Gibbons announced that, upon his return from the disabled list, Sanchez would pitch out of the bullpen.[27] He was activated on July 25 in Seattle. Sanchez was ejected from a game against the Kansas City Royals on August 2, for hitting Alcides Escobar with a pitch after home plate umpire Jim Wolf had issued a warning in the first inning. MLB deemed it intentional, and he was suspended for 3 games on August 4.[28] Sanchez made 11 starts in the 2015 regular season and 30 relief appearances, earning a 7–6 record, 3.22 ERA, and 61 strikeouts in 921⁄3 innings.[21] He appeared in all five games of the Division Series against the Texas Rangers, and did not allow a run in 51⁄3 innings pitched.

On March 28, John Gibbons announced that Sanchez would begin the 2016 season in the starting rotation, but insinuated that he would be held to an innings-limit that may move him to the bullpen later in the season. To that point in the spring, Sanchez had thrown 20 innings, yielding only three runs and three walks while striking out 19.[30] Sanchez carried a 9–1 record into the All-Star break, and on July 9, he was named to the 2016 All-Star Game as a replacement for Craig Kimbrel.[31] On July 25, Sanchez won his 10th consecutive decision, defeating the San Diego Padres. In doing so, he became the first Blue Jay since Roy Halladay in 2003 to win at least 10 consecutive decisions.[32] In his start on July 31, Sanchez threw seven innings and surpassed his career-high of 1331⁄3 innings pitched, raising his 2016 total to 1391⁄3.[33]Prior to the trade deadline, the Blue Jays acquired Francisco Liriano from the Pittsburgh Pirates, and it was widely believed that Liriano would take Sanchez's place in the starting rotation and allow Sanchez to be moved to the bullpen, to better limit his workload in the 2016 season. Several members of the team and media, including Russell Martin and Hall-of-Famer John Smoltz, expressed their desire to see Sanchez remain in the rotation.[34] Entering August, Sanchez had an American League leading 2.71 ERA.[35] After meeting with Sanchez, John Gibbons, and pitching coach Pete Walker, general manager Ross Atkins announced on August 4 that Sanchez would remain a starter, and that the team would use a six-man rotation.[36] Sanchez started against the Cleveland Indians on August 20, and was optioned to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays the following day in order to skip his next start.[37] Sanchez was recalled on August 31.[38] He lasted just 32⁄3 innings in his start on September 11, leaving due to a blister on his pitching hand.[39] Sanchez's next start was skipped to allow his blister to heal, and he returned to the rotation on September 21. Sanchez earned his 15th win of the season on October 2, lowering his earned run average to 3.00 and earning him the American League ERA title. The win also clinched the first AL Wild Card position.[40] Sanchez closed the 2016 regular season with a 15–2 record, 3.00 ERA, and 161 strikeouts in 192 innings pitched.[21] He started the third game of the Division Series against the Texas Rangers, and allowed six earned runs in 52⁄3 innings. Toronto would win the game in extra innings, 7–6, and eliminate the Rangers from the postseason for the second consecutive season. In the Championship Series, Sanchez started Game 4 and gave the Blue Jays their only win of the series, pitching six innings and allowing only two hits and one earned run to the Cleveland Indians.[21]On October 25, general manager Ross Atkins stated that the organization would not limit Sanchez's innings in the 2017 season.[41] Sanchez finished seventh in voting for the 2016 American League Cy Young Award, receiving a third place vote and three fifth place votes.[42] On January 25, 2017, Sanchez was announced as the cover athlete for the Canadian version of MLB The Show 17.[43]During 2017 spring training, the Blue Jays renewed Sanchez's contract at the MLB-minimum of $535,000. The team had reportedly attempted to negotiate a raise in payment with Sanchez and his agent, Scott Boras, however the offer was refused by Sanchez and Boras.[44][45] On April 16, Sanchez was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a lingering blister on his right hand.[46] He underwent minor surgery on April 18 to remove a portion of the fingernail on his right middle finger.[47] Sanchez was activated from the disabled list on April 30 and started that day against the Tampa Bay Rays, but lasted only one inning before leaving with a split fingernail.[48][49] The injury forced Sanchez back to the disabled list the following day.[50] On May 20, 2017, Sanchez was placed on the 10-day disabled list for the third time of the season due to the same finger issue.[51] Sanchez was placed on the disabled list for the fourth time in the season on July 22 with a recurrence of the same blister.[52] Sanchez made only 8 starts for the Blue Jays in 2017 due to blister and finger issues, finishing with a 1–3 record and a 4.25 ERA.On January 12, 2018, Sanchez avoided salary arbitration with the Blue Jays by signing a one-year, $2.7 million contract.[53] He struggled to begin the season with inconsistency and control, walking 45 batters in 79+2⁄3 innings.

CitySprouts;"CitySprouts is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that partners with public school teachers and other school staff to develop school gardens in public school communities in Boston and Cambridge.CitySprouts began in 2001 when a small group of parents, a teacher and a school principal came together to create a schoolyard learning garden that would be accessible to every child in their school. They were motivated by a variety of factors. They knew there were too few opportunities for urban children to explore their natural environment. They felt public school teachers’ need for more hands-on, experiential learning, especially in science. Lastly, they shared concern about children knowing little about food systems, including where their own food came from.They believed school gardens could have an enormous impact on both children’s learning and on their good health. They envisioned a schoolyard garden with natural habitats that invited children to wonder and explore, and a place to gain important social skills and taste food they had grown themselves. Few school garden models existed that were designed for access by struggling public schools. CitySprouts’ founders were guided by the vision of learning gardens in urban, high-need schools that were woven into the fabric of the school community.CitySprouts quickly developed an on-going collaboration with Cambridge Public School science department to ensure strong connections between the district’s school learning gardens and its STEM curriculum. By 2009 the CitySprouts program had expanded to every K-8 school in Cambridge Public School District. In 2012, CitySprouts began building an equivalent sized cohort of school partnerships in Boston Public Schools. CitySprouts soon launched a school garden-based summer and after school program for middle schoolers based on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) practices through an ecosystems and food systems lens.In 2018, CitySprouts announced an early learning initiative in partnership with Boston schools. Through a year-long series of teacher workshops, CitySprouts early learning initiative will bridge the PreK – Grade 2 science standards and the school learning garden to increase the number of Boston children entering third grade with a solid foundation in scientific thinking and content knowledge.CitySprouts is notable in the field of garden-based education for its long-standing relationships with the school districts it serves. Both Cambridge Public Schools and Boston Public Schools have contracts with CitySprouts that provide a significant portion of the program’s operating expenses. CitySprouts is a charter member of the Boston Public School Portfolio Opportunity, organizations vetted for program quality and alignment with the district’s goals. CitySprouts was selected as a charter organization in the BoSTEM education, innovation & research initiative in 2017.Over the course of its history, CitySprouts has emerged as a leader in the 21st century garden-based education movement. It was recognized in 2008 as a regional social innovator by Boston-based Social Innovation Forum. In 2015, founding director Jane Hirschi published Ripe for Change: Garden-Based Learning in Schools (Harvard Education Press 2015), describing the new model of garden-based learning in urban school districts around the countryThe CitySprouts mission is to develop, implement, and maintain beautiful, resource-rich school gardens in collaboration with public school communities. Integrated into the curriculum, CitySprouts gardens inspire teachers, students, and families to develop a deep, connection to hands-on science, edible education, and the opportunity to explore the natural world in the neighborhoods where they live, learn, and play.https://www.hepg.org/hel-home/issues/28_6/helarticle/take-the-common-core-outdoors_554https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/15/05/harvard-edcast-roots-school-gardening-movementhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/school-gardens_n_7119898https://www.citysprouts.org/mission-impact"

Horseferry Road;"Horseferry Road is a street in the City of Westminster in central London running between Millbank and Greycoat Place. It is perhaps best known as the site of City of Westminster Magistrates' Court (which until 2006 was called Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court).  The ubiquity of the Magistrates' Court in newspaper crime reports means that the road name has wide recognition in the UK. Other notable institutions which are or have been located on Horseferry Road include Broadwood and Sons, the Gas Light and Coke Company, British Standards Institution, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the Burberry Group, the Environment Agency headquarters in Horseferry House, the National Probation Service, the Department for Transport and Channel 4. The Marsham Street Home Office building backs on to this road.The road is designated part of the B323 road, along with Greycoat Place, Artillery Row and Buckingham Gate.[1]The road takes its name from the ferry which existed on the site of what is now Lambeth Bridge.[2] Owned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the ferry was an important crossing over the Thames, from Westminster Palace to Lambeth Palace.[3] The earliest known reference to the ferry dates to 1513, but there may have been a ford near the site in Roman times.  The ferry pier was the starting point for the flight of King James II from England in 1689. In 1736, Princess Augusta, who became the mother of George III, crossed the Thames via the horse ferry on the way to her wedding.In 1734, plans were drawn up for a bridge to replace the ferry. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1736, and the money was raised by lottery and grants. Parliament changed the plans for the position of the bridge, and Westminster Bridge was finished first, resulting in the gradual decline of the ferry.  It was eventually replaced on 10 November 1862, when the first Lambeth Bridge was opened.  It quickly deteriorated, and was replaced in 1932.Horseferry Road has been the site of numerous Government buildings including Horseferry House, which was the location of No. 5 (London) Regional Fire Control Centre during World War II,[4] and the headquarters of 26th Middlesex (Cyclist) Volunteer Rifle Corps.[5] The building was most recently used by the Home Office to house Prison and Probation head office staff, and is as of 2007 being converted into residential flats.The regimental headquarters and museum of the London Scottish Regiment is at no. 95,[6] this was where the inquiry into the sinking of RMS Titanic took place in 1912.During World War I the Australian Imperial Force's Administrative Headquarters was located on Horseferry Road.[7] They rented the buildings from Westminster Training College throughout the war while the college was evacuated to Richmond.Established by the Methodist Church in 1851, Westminster College occupied the site until it relocated to Oxford in 1959. Today their Oxford site is the Harcourt Hill Campus of Oxford Brookes University, but the archives and art collections of Westminster College can still be viewed on the site. Their site on Horseferry Road meanwhile is now the location for the Channel 4 Headquarters, which were built there in 1994.Phyllis Pearsall conceived and created the London A to Z map while living in a bedsit in Horseferry Road.[8]There is another Horseferry Road in Limehouse, London E14 parallel to Narrow Street, and another off Creek Road in Greenwich.Coordinates: 51°29′42″N 0°07′53″W﻿ / ﻿51.4949°N 0.1313°W﻿ / 51.4949, -0.1313"

Health and Social Care Act 2012;"The Health and Social Care Act 2012 (c 7) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It provided for the most extensive reorganisation of the structure of the National Health Service in England to date.[1] It removed responsibility for the health of citizens from the Secretary of State for Health, which the post had carried since the inception of the NHS in 1948. It abolished primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) and transferred between £60 billion and £80 billion of "commissioning", or healthcare funds, from the abolished PCTs to several hundred clinical commissioning groups, partly run by the general practitioners (GPs) in England. A new executive agency of the Department of Health, Public Health England, was established under the act on 1 April 2013.[2]The proposals are primarily the result of policies of the then Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley. Writing in the BMJ, Clive Peedell (co-chairman of the NHS Consultants Association and a consultant clinical oncologist) compared the policies with academic analyses of privatisation and found "evidence that privatisation is an inevitable consequence of many of the policies contained in the Health and Social Care Bill".[3] Lansley said that claims that the government is attempting to privatise the NHS are "ludicrous scaremongering".[4]The proposals contained in the act were some of the coalition government's most controversial. Although mentioned in the Conservative Party's manifesto in 2010,[5] they were not contained in the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement,[1] which mentioned the NHS only to commit the coalition to a real-term funding increase every year.[6] Within two months of the election a white paper was published, outlining what The Daily Telegraph called the "biggest revolution in the NHS since its foundation".[7] The bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 19 January 2011.[8][9] In April 2011 the government announced a "listening exercise", halting the Bill's legislative progress until after the May local elections, the "listening exercise" finished by the end of that month. The Bill received Royal Assent on 27 March 2012.The proposals in the act were not discussed during the general election campaign in 2010 and were not contained in the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement of 20 May 2010,[1] which declared an intention to "stop the top-down reorganisations of the NHS that have got in the way of patient care".[7] However, within two months a white paper outlined what the Daily Telegraph called the "biggest revolution in the NHS since its foundation".[7] The white paper, Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS,[10] was followed in December 2010 by an implementation plan in the form of Liberating the NHS: legislative framework and next steps.[11] McKinsey & Company who have been influential in the British Department of Health for many years was heavily involved in the discussions around the Bill.[citation needed] The bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 19 January 2011[8] and received its second reading, a vote to approve the general principles of the Bill, by 321–235, a majority of 86, on 31 January 2011.[12]The act had implications for the entire English NHS. Primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) were abolished, with projected redundancy costs of £1 billion for around 21,000 staff.[13] £60 to £80 billion worth of commissioning will be transferred from PCTs to several hundred clinical commissioning groups, partly run by GPs. Around 3,600 facilities owned by PCTs and SHAs would transfer to NHS Property Services, a limited company owned by the Department of Health.When the white paper was presented to Parliament, the Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley, told MPs of three key principles:The white paper set out a timetable. By April 2012 it proposed to:The Bill foresaw all NHS trusts becoming, or being amalgamated into, foundation trusts. The Bill also abolished the existing cap on trusts' income from non-NHS sources, which in most cases was previously set at a relatively low single-digit percentage.Under the Bill's provisions the new commissioning system was expected to be in place by April 2013, at which time SHAs and PCTs would be abolished.The Bill was analysed by Stephen Cragg of Doughty Street Chambers, on behalf of the 38 Degrees campaign, who concluded that "Effectively, the duty to provide a national health service would be lost if the Bill becomes law, and would be replaced by a duty on an unknown number of commissioning consortia with only a duty to make or arrange provision for that section of the population for which it is responsible."  It replaces a "duty to provide" with a "duty to promote".[14]After an increase in opposition pressure, including from both rank-and-file Liberal Democrats and the British Medical Association, the government announced a "listening exercise" with critics.[15] On 4 April 2011 the government announced a "pause" in the progress of the Bill to allow the government to 'listen, reflect and improve' the proposals.[16][17]The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said "the status quo is not an option" and many within his and Nick Clegg's coalition said that certain aspects of the Bill, such as the formation of Clinical commissioning groups, were not only not open for discussion, but also already too far along the path to completion to be stopped.[18] Cameron insisted that the act was part of his "Big Society" agenda and that it would not alter the fundamental principles of the NHS.Part of the "listening exercise" saw the creation on 6 April 2011 of the "NHS Future Forum".[19] The Forum, according to Private Eye, "brings together 43 hand-picked individuals, many of whom are known as supporters of Lansley's approach".[20] At the same time, David Cameron set up a separate panel to advise him on the reforms, members of this panel include Lord Crisp (NHS chief executive 2000–2006), Bill Moyes (a former head of Monitor), and the head of global health systems at McKinsey,[20][21] as well as Mark Britnell, the head of health policy at KPMG. Six months previously Britnell had told a conference of private healthcare executives that "In future, the NHS will be a state insurance provider not a state deliverer," and emphasised the role of Lansley's reforms in making this possible: "The NHS will be shown no mercy and the best time to take advantage of this will be in the next couple of years."[22][23] KPMG issued a press statement on behalf of Britnell on 16 May 2011 stating "The article in The Observer attributes quotes to me that do not properly reflect discussions held at a private conference last October. Nor was I given the opportunity to respond ahead of publication.   I worked in the NHS for twenty years and now work alongside it. I have always been a passionate advocate of the NHS and believe that it has a great future. Like many other countries throughout the world, the pressure facing healthcare funding and provision are enormous. If the NHS is to change and modernise the public, private and voluntary sectors will all need to play their part."In June 2011 Cameron announced that the original deadline of 2013 would no longer be part of the reforms. There would also be changes to the Bill to make clear that the main duty of the health regulator, Monitor, was to promote the interests of patients rather than promoting competition.[24]The Future Forum report suggested that any organisation that treats NHS patients, including independent hospitals, should be forced to hold meetings in public and publish minutes. It also wanted the establishment of a Citizens' Panel to report on how easy it is to choose services, while patients would be given a right to challenge poor treatment. The original Bill sought to abolish two tiers of management and hand power to new bodies led by GPs, called commissioning consortia, to buy £60 billion a year in treatment. Professor Steve Field, a GP who chaired the forum, said many of the fears the public and medical profession had about the Health and Social Care Bill had been "justified" as it contained "insufficient safeguards" against private companies exploiting the NHS.[25]Following the completion of the listening exercise, the Bill was recommitted to a public bill committee on 21 June 2011.[26] On 7 September, the Bill passed the House of Commons and received its third reading by 316–251.[27] On 12 October 2011, the Bill was approved in principle at second reading in the House of Lords by 354–220.[28] An amendment moved by Lord Owen to commit the most controversial clauses of the Bill to a select committee was defeated by 330–262.[29] The Bill was subsequently committed to a committee of the whole House for detailed scrutiny. The committee stage was completed on 21 December 2011, and the Bill was passed by the Lords, with amendments, on 19 March 2012.[8] The Commons agreed to all Lords amendments to the Bill on 20 March 2012. The Bill received Royal Assent and became the Health and Social Care Act 2012 on 27 March 2012.[30]Section 9 establishes the National Health Service Commissioning Board, later known as NHS England. The Secretary of State is to publish, annually, a document known as the mandate which specifies the objectives which the Board should seek to achieve.  National Health Service (Mandate Requirements) Regulations are published each year to give legal force to the mandate.Section 10 establishes Clinical Commissioning Groups which are to arrange the provision of health services in each local area.Section 11 makes the protection of public health a duty of the Secretary of State, and section 12 makes local authorities responsible for improving the health of the people in their areas. Among the effects of this, local authorities regained the commissioning of some community services such as those for sexual health and substance misuse.[31]Section 30 requires each local authority to appoint a director of public health, and gives the Secretary of State certain powers over that person's appointment.Sections 181 to 189 establish Healthwatch England, responsible for gathering and championing the views of users of health and social care services in order to identify improvements and influence providers' plans.Sections 194 to 199 establish Health and wellbeing boards in each upper-tier local authority, in order to encourage providers of health and social care to work in an integrated manner.Sections 232 to 249 expand the role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to include social care, re-establishing the body on 1 April 2013 as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (known as NICE). This non-departmental public body publishes guidance in areas such as the use of new and existing medicines, treatments and procedures, taking into account cost-effectiveness, its scope is NHS services, public health services, and (in England only) social care.Sections 278 to 283 abolished the Alcohol Education and Research Council, the Appointments Commission, the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care, the National Patient Safety Agency, the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement and the standing advisory committees.Sections 284 to 309 contained various other provisions.On 19 January 2012 two major unions of healthcare professionals that had previously tried to work with the government on the bill, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives, decided instead to join with the British Medical Association in "outright opposition" to the bill.[32] On 3 February 2012 the Royal College of General Practitioners also called on the Prime Minister to withdraw the bill.[33]The Confederation of British Industry supported the bill, declaring that "Allowing the best provider to deliver healthcare services, whether they are a private company or a charity, will spur innovation and choice."[34]In May 2011, a number of doctors from GP consortia wrote a letter to the Daily Telegraph in which they expressed their support for the bill, calling its plans "a natural conclusion of the GP commissioning role that began with fundholding in the 1990s and, more recently, of the previous government's agenda of GP polysystems and practice-based commissioning".[35] On 14 May 2011, The Guardian published an article reporting that the GP appointed to head the NHS "listening exercise" has unilaterally condemned the bill.[36] The article said that Steve Field had "dismissed" the plans "as unworkable" and that these statements were "provisional conclusions that could fatally undermine the plans". The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) also denounced the bill.[37]The Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons[34] welcomed in principle the idea of medical professionals determining the direction of NHS services, but questioned the Bill's implementation of the principle, particularly in regard to the approach of making GP consortia the primary commissioning deciders, and also in regard to requiring competition. The British Medical Association said similarly.[34] Neither of these organisations supported the bill.In February 2011 David Bennett, newly appointed Chair of Monitor, said the NHS could become like other privatised utilities, so that Monitor would potentially be a regulator like Ofcom, Ofgem and Ofwat: "We, in the UK, have done this in other sectors before. We did it in gas, we did it in power, we did it in telecoms […] We've done it in rail, we've done it in water, so there's actually 20 years of experience in taking monopolistic, monolithic markets and providers and exposing them to economic regulation."[38] The House of Commons Select Committee on Health condemned the comparison as not "accurate or helpful."[39]The bill intended to make general practitioners the direct overseers of NHS funds, rather than having those funds channelled through neighbourhood- and region-based primary care trusts, as was previously done.[40]There were concerns about fragmentation of the NHS and a loss of coordination and planning. The Royal College of General Practitioners said it was "concerned that some of the types of choice outlined in the government's proposals run a risk of destabilising the NHS and causing long-term harm to patient outcomes, particularly in cases of children with disabilities, those with multiple comorbidities and the frail and elderly."[34] The Royal College of Physicians said that "Whilst we welcome the broad provision in the bill to seek professional expertise, the RCP is concerned that the bill does not require that specialists are at the heart of the commissioning process."[34] The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it "would be dismayed if psychiatrists were not closely involved with local consortia of GPs in the development of mental health services."[34] The Royal College of Surgeons said that "the legislation leaves the question of regional level commissioning unanswered with no intermediary structure put in place."[34] And there were concerns about management expertise, particularly by looking at the US. The BMJ wrote that"No matter how many GP consortiums eventually emerge, their number will probably greatly exceed the 152 primary care trusts they are replacing, which brings a set of new challenges. Smaller populations increase the chances that a few very expensive patients will blow a hole in budgets. More consortiums mean that commissioning skills, already in short supply nationally, will be spread even more thinly. Denied economies of scale, smaller consortiums may be tempted to cut corners on high quality infrastructure and management, thereby endangering their survival. These points emerge clearly from an examination of 20 years of US experience of handing the equivalent of commissioning budgets to groups of doctors. Some groups had severely underestimated the importance of high quality professional management support in their early days and gone bankrupt as a result."[1][41]The House of Commons health committee has suggested the government let experts other than the consortia GPs and their direct allies get involved in the running of the consortia, including hospital doctors, public health chiefs, social care staff, and councillors. That idea received some wider support and the government agreed to give it consideration. Those close to Health Secretary Andrew Lansley have said that he is concerned adding too many people to consortia decision-making risks making them too unwieldy."[42] In 2010 the same committee had gone so far as to declare that "if reliable figures for the costs of commissioning prove that it is uneconomic and if it does not begin to improve soon, after 20 years of costly failure, the purchaser/provider split may need to be abolished."[1][43]Kieran Walshe, professor of health policy and management and Chris Ham, chief executive of the King's Fund, argued that "At a national level, it is difficult to see who, if anyone, will be in charge of the NHS. There will be five key national bodies: the Department of Health, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the Care Quality Commission, the NHS Commissioning Board, and the economic regulator Monitor. Although the remit of each is set out in legislation, it is not clear how these national bodies will interact or how they will provide coordinated and consistent governance of the NHS."[44]Clinical commissioning groups operate as statutory bodies, though it was suggested that up to third of CCGs are reluctant to do so.[45]The King's Fund said that "the very real risk that the speed and scale of the reforms could destabilise the NHS and undermine care must be actively managed."[34]The BMJ said in January 2011 that "The bill promises that all general practices will be part of consortiums by April 2012, yet it took six years for 56% of general practices to become fundholders after the introduction of the internal market. Nearly seven years after the first NHS trust was granted foundation status, there are still more than half to go—within two years. And there's more. The replacement for the 10 strategic health authorities—the NHS Commissioning Board—needs to be fully operational by next April. By then, GP consortiums should have developed relationships with local authorities, which will assume ultimate responsibility for public health via their new health and wellbeing boards, working alongside Public Health England, a completely new entity."[1] The BMA believes such targets to be either wholly impossible or, at best, able to be done only in a very roughshod manner, which could in turn have very serious on-the-ground consequences to NHS functioning.The British Medical Association opposed the bill,[46] and held its first emergency meeting in 19 years,[47] which asked the government to withdraw the bill and reconsider the reforms, although a motion of no confidence in Andrew Lansley by the BMA failed.[47] A later motion of no confidence in Lansley at the Royal College of Nursing Conference in 2011 succeeded, with 96% voting in favour of the motion, and several speeches thereafter condemning Lansley threefold: the Health and Social Care Bill 2011 as written, Lansley's decision not to address the entire Conference with a speech, but instead to hold a separate meeting with 40 Conference attendees in a separate space (taken as an insult to nurses, and leading to accusations of 'gutlessness'), and the current separate "efficiency savings" measures being undertaken across the NHS and those actions' material impact on frontline medical services, especially as contrasted with several prominent officials, including NHS leaders and Lansley himself, repeatedly assuring that NHS frontline services are 'protected' at all times regardless of these "savings" measures.[48][49] "People will die", Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, warned in March 2012, as he predicted "unprecedented chaos" as a result of the reforms,[50] with a leaked draft risk-assessment claiming that emergencies could be less well managed and the increased use of the private sector could drive up costs.[51]Various pressure groups opposed the bill, including The People's Assembly, NHS Direct Action,[52] Keep Our NHS Public, 38 Degrees,[53] the Socialist Health Association, many Trades unions, including the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, UNISON, and Unite.[54] 38 Degrees' petition against the reforms passed 250,000 signatures by 21 April 2011.[53] In March 2011 a motion at the Liberal Democrat spring conference called for changes to the Bill to ensure greater accountability and prevent cherry-picking by private providers, among other demands aimed at reducing marketisation of the NHS.[55] UNISON sponsored rapper NxtGen to create an unflattering hip hop track about the bill,[56] which has now been viewed over 390,000 times on YouTube.[57]Jeremy Hunt was appointed Health Secretary in a cabinet reshuffle on 4 September 2012, succeeding Lansley.[58] He had previously co-authored a book calling for the NHS to be dismantled and replaced with a system of personal health accounts.[59] The deputy chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Kailash Chand, said "Jeremy Hunt is new Health Secretary – disaster in the NHS carries on. I fear a more toxic right winger to follow the privatisation agenda."[60]On 9 October 2011, a protest organised by UK Uncut took place on Westminster Bridge. an estimated 2,000 health workers and activists attended the protest.[61]On 5 March 2012, the campaign group 38 Degrees erected 130 billboards in the centre of London with the aim of persuading David Cameron to abandon the bill.[62]On 25 September 2013 Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham promised that the party would repeal the Health and Social Care Act in "the first Queen's Speech" if elected.[63]In January 2015, Chris Ham and others from the King's Fund produced a review of the government's health reforms. Their conclusions as far as the act was concerned were that: In November 2017, Jeremy Hunt in an interview with the Health Service Journal said "The idea of lots of competing foundation trusts and payment by results works well when you have in your mind that most of the work the NHS does will be single episode elective care, but when you're dealing with complex patients who are going in and out of the system a lot those structures prove not to be fit for purpose."[65]Nick Timmins, writing in 2018, concluded that the legislation, in its own terms, had failed.  Choice and competition were not, as envisaged, the driving principles of the NHS. In fact the development of integrated care systems was unpicking the "purchaser/provider" split that had been the dominant theme of NHS management since 1991. The organisations set up by the act, Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority had effectively been merged. And there was nothing to suggest that "political micro-management" and "excessive bureaucratic and political control" had disappeared.  However, he said the act had given the NHS an independent voice, and that according to Jeremy Hunt "the independence of NHS England is the bit that has worked best".[66] David Benbow argued in 2020 that the legislation did not extend patient choice as envisaged (as this policy subsequently took a backseat) but that it did lead to an increasing amount of the NHS budget being diverted to private providers.[67]The publication of the NHS Long Term Plan in January 2019 marked the official abandonment of the policy of competition in the English NHS. Integrated care systems would be created across England by 2021, and in 2022 Clinical Commissioning Groups were abolished and NHS Improvement absorbed into NHS England, though all this was intended to happen without repealing the legislation.[68] In February 2019, NHS England produced a document outlining changes it wanted to see in legislation. One of the central proposals was to remove the obligation to put services out to competitive tender if local commissioners considered a service would be best provided from within the NHS.[69]"
Succession to the former French throne (Bonapartist);"The succession to the throne of the French Empire was vested by Bonapartist emperors in the descendants and selected male relatives of  Napoleon I (r. 1804–1814/15). Following the abolition of the Second French Empire in 1870, Bonapartist pretenders descended from Napoleon I's brothers have maintained theoretical claims to the imperial office.The French Empire (or Napoleonic Empire) formally existed during two periods when the head of the French state was a monarch who held the title of Emperor of the French.The First French Empire was the regime established by Napoleon I in France. This empire lasted from 1804 to 1814, from the Consulate of the First French Republic to the Bourbon Restoration, and was briefly restored during the Hundred Days in 1815.The Second French Empire was the regime established in France by Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second French Republic and the Third French Republic. Napoleon III was the third son of Louis Bonaparte, a younger brother of Napoleon I, and Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Napoleon I's wife, Josephine de Beauharnais, by her first marriage.Bonapartism had its followers from 1815 onward among those who never accepted the defeat at Waterloo or the Congress of Vienna. Napoleon I's death in exile on Saint Helena in 1821 only transferred the allegiance of many of his loyalists to other members of the House of Bonaparte.After the death in 1832 of Napoleon I's son, known to Bonapartists as Napoleon II, Bonapartist hopes rested in several different members of the family.The disturbances of 1848 gave this group hope. Bonapartists were essential in the election of Napoleon I's nephew Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte as president of the Second French Republic. They also gave him crucial political support for the 1852 coup d'état, which overthrew the Republic and paved the way for the proclamation of the Second French Empire the following year, with Napoleon III as emperor.In 1870, Napoleon III led France to a disastrous defeat at the hands of Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, and he subsequently abdicated.Following the definite overthrow of the Second French Empire, the Third French Republic was established. Bonapartism faded from a civic faith and monarchist bloc to an obscure predilection, more akin to a hobby than a practical political philosophy or movement. The death knell for Bonapartism was probably sounded when Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, the only son of Napoleon III, was killed in action while serving as a British Army officer in Zululand in 1879. Thereafter, Bonapartism ceased to be a political force.The law of succession that Napoleon I established on becoming emperor in 1804 provided that the imperial throne should pass firstly to Napoleon I's own legitimate male descendants through the male line, to the perpetual exclusion of women.It further provided that if Napoleon I's own direct line died out, the claim passed first to his older brother Joseph Bonaparte and to his legitimate male descendants through the male line, then to his younger brother Louis Bonaparte and his legitimate male descendants through the male line. His other brothers, Lucien Bonaparte and Jérôme Bonaparte, and their descendants, were omitted from the succession, even though Lucien was older than Louis, because they had politically defied the emperor, made marriages of which he disapproved, or both.Upon the extinction of legitimate natural and adopted male, agnatic descendants of Napoleon I, and those of two of his brothers, Joseph and Louis, the throne was to be awarded to a man selected by the non-dynastic princely and ducal dignitaries of the empire, as ratified by a plebiscite.At the time the law of succession was decreed, Napoleon I had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely that he would have any due to the age of his wife, Joséphine de Beauharnais. His eventual response was to have his marriage to Joséphine annulled and to undertake a second marriage with Roman Catholic rites to Archduchess Marie Louise, daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria. Their only child was Napoleon, King of Rome, known in exile as "Napoleon II" and as the Duke of Reichstadt. He died unmarried, thereby extinguishing the legitimate descent of Napoleon I.Meanwhile, Napoleon I's older brother, Joseph, recognized upon establishment of the First Empire as first in line to succeed and (after the birth of the King of Rome) as second in line, died on 28 July 1844 without ever having had a legitimate son. Although two of Joseph's daughters married in exile, when the Bonaparte dynasty was restored by the 1851 French coup d'état in France in December 1851, the man who soon became emperor as Napoleon III was the only living, legally legitimate son of Louis Bonaparte, former King of Holland.In December 1852, with the imperial crown on his head, Napoleon III, still a bachelor, exercised the authority granted him by a decree in the form of a Sénatus-consulte (and confirmed by plebiscite), to enact a new organic law on the succession (in the event he himself were to leave no legitimate descendants). Napoleon III recognized Napoleon I's last surviving brother, Jérôme, as the heir presumptive. (During Napoleon I's reign, Jérôme had been one of the Bonaparte brothers who was bypassed in the order of succession, his first marriage having been an elopement with the American commoner Elizabeth Patterson over the emperor's objections. The Second Empire, however, empowered the new emperor to choose an heir among any of Napoleon I's nephews.) After Jérôme came Jérôme's male descendants by his second, dynastic marriage to Princess Catharine of Württemberg.[1]Napoleon III, hitherto a bachelor, began to look for a wife to produce a legitimate heir. Most of the royal families of Europe were unwilling to intermarry with the parvenu House of Bonaparte. After several rebuffs, including from Princess Carola of Sweden and Princess Adelaide von Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Napoleon III decided to lower his sights somewhat and marry for love instead, choosing the young, beautiful countess of Teba, Eugénie de Montijo, a Spanish noblewoman who had been brought up in Paris.In 1856, Eugénie gave birth to a legitimate son and heir, Napoléon Eugène Louis, the Prince Imperial who, upon his father's defeat in battle and deposition in September 1870, went into exile. He became the claimant to the throne of the Second Empire when his father died in 1873. Like the King of Rome, the Prince Imperial died unwed and childless. All Bonapartist claimants since 1879 have been descendants of Jérôme Bonaparte in the male line.This branch of claimants was established by Napoleon Joseph Charles Bonaparte,[1] nicknamed Plon-Plon. He was the only legitimate male descendant of Jérôme Bonaparte from his second marriage to Princess Catherine of Württemberg. He married Princess Clothilde of Savoy and died in 1891. His son, Victor, Prince Napoléon, the next claimant, wed Princess Clémentine of Belgium, and died in 1926.[1]He was succeeded by his son, Louis Jérôme Bonaparte, husband of Alix de Foresta, daughter of Count Albéric de Foresta, who died in 1997.[1] He was succeeded by his son, Charles Marie Jérôme Victor Napoléon Bonaparte. He married, civilly, Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, from whom he was divorced, being subsequently declared excluded as Napoleonic heir in his father's will for divorcing her and remarrying a commoner without paternal permission.[1] His heir apparent (recognized by some as head of the House of Bonaparte since 1997) is his son, Jean-Christophe Napoléon.[1]There are no surviving descendants in the legitimate male line of any of Napoleon's brothers except Jérôme.[1] This branch of the House of Bonaparte is recognized by Bonapartists as Napoleon I's dynastic heirs, being excluded from residence in France or service in its military by law, along with the heads of the House of Orléans, between 1883 and 1950.The head and dynastic members of the family bear the title of Prince with the name Napoléon (Bonaparte) and the style of Imperial Highness.[1]"
Rilla of Ingleside;"Rilla of Ingleside (1921) is the eighth of nine books in the Anne of Green Gables series by Lucy Maud Montgomery, but was the sixth "Anne" novel in publication order. This book draws the focus back onto a single character, Anne and Gilbert's youngest daughter Bertha Marilla "Rilla" Blythe. It has a more serious tone, as it takes place during World War I and the three Blythe boys—Jem, Walter, and Shirley—along with Rilla's sweetheart Ken Ford, playmates Jerry Meredith and Carl Meredith—end up fighting in Europe with the Canadian Expeditionary Force.The book is dedicated: "To the memory of FREDERICA CAMPBELL MACFARLANE who went away from me when the dawn broke on January 25, 1919—a true friend, a rare personality, a loyal and courageous soul." Frederica, Maud's cousin and best friend, grew up in Park Corner, PEI, but died in the Spanish flu.  Frederica may have been the model for Diana Barry, Anne of Green Gables' "bosom friend": both had unusual, non-Christian first names, and the fictional Diana's husband was named, perhaps not coincidentally, Fred.Rilla of Ingleside is the only Canadian novel written from a woman's perspective about the First World War by a contemporary.[1] The novel is also groundbreaking as it is one of the first non-Australian texts to mention the Gallipoli campaign and the sacrifice made by the ANZACs.At some point after Montgomery's death in 1942, publishers quietly trimmed Rilla of Ingleside of a few thousand words, removing among other things passages containing historically accurate but now offensive anti-German sentiment.  The trimmed version was the only available "in print" version for decades, until a new, restored and annotated edition of Rilla of Ingleside, edited by Benjamin Lefebvre (editor of Montgomery's The Blythes Are Quoted) and Andrea McKenzie, was published by Viking Canada in October 2010.[2]Set almost a decade after Rainbow Valley, Europe is on the brink of the First World War, and Anne's youngest daughter Rilla is an irrepressible almost-15-year-old, excited about her first adult party and blissfully unaware of the chaos that the Western world is about to enter. Her parents worry because Rilla seems not to have any ambition, is not interested in attending college, and is more concerned with having fun.Once the Continent descends into war, Jem Blythe and Jerry Meredith promptly enlist, upsetting Anne, Nan, and Faith Meredith (whom Rilla suspects is engaged to Jem). Rilla's brother Walter, who is of age, does not enlist, ostensibly due to a recent bout with typhoid but truly because he fears the ugliness of war and death. He confides in Rilla that he feels he is a coward. Rilla was a bit happy because she was closer to Walter than to her brother Jem.The enlisted boys report to Kingsport for training. Jem's dog, Dog Monday, takes up a vigil at the Glen train station waiting for Jem to come back. Rilla's siblings Nan, Di, and Walter return to Redmond College, and Shirley returns to Queen's Academy, leaving Rilla anxiously alone at home with her parents, their spinster housekeeper Susan Baker, and Gertrude Oliver, a teacher who is boarding with the Blythes while her fiancé reports to the front.As the war drags on, Rilla matures, organizing the Junior Red Cross in her village. While collecting donations for the war effort, she comes across a house where a young mother has just died with her husband away at war, leaving no one to care for her two-week-old son. Rilla takes the sickly little boy back to Ingleside in a soup tureen, naming him "James Kitchener Anderson" after his father and, on the insistence of Susan, Herbert Kitchener, British Secretary of State for War. Rilla's father Gilbert challenges her to raise the war orphan, and although she doesn't like babies at all, she rises to the occasion, eventually coming to love "Jims" as her own. She also assists in the elopement of a soldier whose beloved is Miranda Pryor, the daughter of the town's only vocal pacifist, the pacifist's attempts to oppose fund-raising for the war effort or to criticize the war while leading prayers are a recurring minor storyline.Rilla and her family pay anxious attention to all the war news as the conflict spreads and thousands die. Rilla grows much closer to Walter, who some townsfolk and fellow students have branded a slacker, an insult he feels deeply. Rilla feels that Walter finally regards her as a chum, not just as his little sister. Walter eventually does enlist, as does Rilla's newfound love interest, Kenneth Ford (the son of Owen and Leslie Ford, who met in Anne's House of Dreams), who kisses her before leaving and asks her to promise she will not kiss anyone else until he returns. She keeps this a secret for much of the book, unsure what it means about his feelings for her. Her mother later tells her that "If Leslie West's son asked you to keep your lips for him, I think you may consider yourself engaged to him." As the war continues, one night Dog Monday begins to howl inconsolably, leading the family to fear something terrible has happened to Jem. Instead, they receive news that Walter was killed in action at Courcelette. (In Anne of Ingleside, published in 1939 but set many years before Rilla of Ingleside, Montgomery foreshadows Walter's death, Anne sees the shadow of a cross cast from the window over sleeping Walter's head.) In Walter's last letter to Rilla, written the day before his death, he tells her that he is no longer afraid and believes it may be better for him to die than to go on living with his memories of war forever spoiling life's beauty. Rilla gives the letter to Una Meredith, as she has long believed Una had been in love with Walter, though she had never spoken of it to either of them. After Rilla had gone back to Ingleside that night, Una swore that she would not let love enter her life again.Anne's youngest son, Shirley, comes of age and immediately joins the flying corps. Susan was deeply touched when Shirley called her "Mother Susan" before he went. Jerry Meredith is wounded at Vimy Ridge, and in early May 1918, Jem is reported wounded and missing following a trench raid. The Blythes spend nearly five months not knowing Jem's fate, but are encouraged by Dog Monday's continued presence at the train station, as Susan reasons a dog so troubled by the death of his master's brother surely would sense a tragedy involving his master. Finally the family receives a telegram: Jem had been taken prisoner in Germany, but eventually escaped to Holland and is now proceeding to England for medical treatment.When the war finally ends, the rest of the boys from Glen St. Mary return home. Mary Vance and Miller Douglas announce plans to marry, with Miller deciding to pursue a career in Mr. Flagg's store after losing a leg in the war. Jem returns on an afternoon train and is met by a joyful Dog Monday. Jims' father returns with a young merry English bride and takes Jims to live with them nearby, Rilla is glad she can still remain part of Jims' life.Life after war resumes. Jem plans to return to college, since he and Faith cannot be married until he finishes studying medicine. Faith, Nan, and Diana plan to teach school, while Jerry, Carl, and Shirley will return to Redmond, along with Una, who plans to take a Household Science course. Noting that Kenneth Ford has survived the war but has not contacted her, Rilla concludes that his interest must have faded and she should consider joining the college-bound group.Finally, Kenneth returns home and proposes to Rilla with the question "Is it Rilla-my-Rilla?"—to which Rilla lisps, "Yeth," a rare slip into her childhood habit.Montgomery continued the story of Anne Shirley in a series of sequels. They are listed in the order of Anne's age in each novel."

The Big 5;"The Big 5 is the largest construction event in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. It is held annually in Dubai in late November and attracts in excess of 67,000 construction professionals (audited by BPA Worldwide).The Big 5 runs alongside six specialised events enabling industry professionals to source products for every stage of the construction projects: The Big 5 Heavy, Middle East Concrete, HVAC R Expo, Middle East Stone, The Big 5 Solar, and the Urban Design & Landscape Expo.The Big 5 has its origins in an event known as Arab Water and came about from an amalgamation of five separate product-focused events that all had a link to the construction sector[1] - such as HVAC and building materials.With the building of the Dubai World Trade Centre, which began to develop in the late 1970s, the event found a permanent home and has expanded in size along with the venue. When dmg events acquired the exhibition in 2000, the event covered some 12,000m²: this has risen to over 100,000m² in gross floor space.Government support for the event has come from both international and local institutions. In 2007, the event was one of the first in the region to welcome a prime minister when the then Italian leader Romano Prodi visited the exhibition with his minister for international trade.[2] In 2012, British prime minister David Cameron also visited the event in support of his nation’s export businesses.[3] The visits reflected both the value of bilateral trade with the UAE but also the rise in importance of the Persian Gulf region as a whole to European export manufacturers.[4]Since 2010 there has been an increasing emphasis on education within the events - in the form of conferences, seminars and workshops - to support continued professional development among audiences. The educational programmes are presented by a wide selection of the industry’s architects, consultants, contractors and sub-contractors who volunteer their time and expertise to further the development of the construction sector. These free education components also include certification, overseen by the UK-based CPD Certification Service, so attendance can contribute to a person’s membership standing in organisations such as RICS or the CIOB.In 2018, The Big 5 launched the Women in Construction Forum & Awards initiative, aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace in the construction industry. Also worth mentioning is the Start-up City feature dedicated to startups with a viable product for the construction industry."

Aimé Teisseire;"Aimé Teisseire (18 December 1914 – 28 June 2008) was a French military officer who fought with the Free French Forces in the African campaign of World War II and later in Europe for the Liberation of France. Wounded multiple times in battle, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre and Order of Liberation. For his service in French Indochina after the war he was made a Grand Officier of the Légion d'Honneur.[1][2]The son of an employee at the Monte Carlo Casino,  Teisseire was born in Puget-Théniers and studied at the Lycée Rouvière in Toulon before taking up a position at Barclays Bank in Monte Carlo. He then decided to enlist in the French army but was initially rejected on medical grounds. After spending some time in Gabon, he managed to enlist in the Senegalese Tirailleurs in 1934. He was sent to the non-commissioned officers' training school in Saint-Maixent-l'École and then assigned to the French Congo where he was promoted to sergeant in 1938. He returned to France later that year and at the outbreak of World War II was stationed at the Rochefort-sur-Mer air base. He demanded a combat job and was finally assigned to the 6th Regiment of the Colonial Infantry. He fought with them in the Battle of France and was promoted to Sergent-chef for his valor in battle near Ardennes. Wounded at Meurthe-et-Moselle in June 1940. he was taken prisoner by the Germans, and sent to the hospital at Nancy but escaped and eventually re-joined the Armée d'Armistice in Frejus.[2][3]In Frejus Teisseire attempted to convince the men to join the Free French Forces but without success. Instead, he was sent to West Africa where after many vicissitudes, he escaped from Dahomey to Lagos. Once there, a British administrator helped him to join the Free French Army in Chad. He was assigned to the 1st Company of the Regiment of Senegalese soldiers of Chad  and in February 1942 was promoted to Adjutant. While training in Morocco, his regiment was evacuated to England. From there he took part in the D-Day landings and went on to fight German tank and infantry divisions in the Forêt d'Écouves. Badly wounded in a battle on the outskirts of Paris, he was discharged and sent to a hospital from which he escaped and hitch-hiked to Paris to rejoin his unit. He then fought with them in a series of battles at Andelot,  Hourcourt, and Châtel-sur-Moselle. For his role in establishing the bridgehead across the Moselle, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant in September 1944. In November, he was again wounded (so seriously this time that he was given the Last Rites), but recovered and rejoined his unit to fight in the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign and eventually in Germany at Berchtesgaden.[2][3]After the war ended, Teisseire was promoted to lieutenant and assigned to French Indochina, arriving in Saigon in December 1946. He served as a company commander there, receiving three battle citations, the Ordre Royal du Cambodge, and later the Légion d'Honneur. On his return to France in 1949, he was promoted to captain. He then served as a company commander in Réunion, Madagascar, Cameroon, and finally in Algeria before retiring from the army in 1961.[2]  In 1955 he had been made an Officier of the Légion d'Honneur and was subsequently promoted to Commandeur and then Grand Officier. Teisseire's wife and daughter were present when Jacques Chirac presented him with the Grand Officier insignia on 6 October 2005.[4]After his retirement from the military, Teisseire worked as the chief of staff in a department store in Nice, where he lived for the rest of his life. When he died at the age of 93, he was one of the 59 surviving Compagnons de la Libération.[1][3]"

The Office of Law Enforcement investigates wildlife crimes, regulates wildlife trade, helps Americans understand and obey wildlife protections laws, and works in partnership with international, state, and tribal counterparts to conserve wildlife resources. This work includes:Distributing information and outreach materials to increase public understanding of wildlife conservation and promote compliance with wildlife protection laws.In order to become a FWS Special Agent, an applicant must be between the ages of 23 and 37. However, due to the decision in Robert P. Isabella v. Department of State and Office of Personnel Management, 2008 M.S.P.B. 146, preference eligible veterans may apply after age 37. In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella decision: OPM Letter.The applicant must also hold American citizenship, have a clean record, and hold a four-year bachelor's degree. In addition, all special agents are required to sign a mobility agreement which indicates a willingness to accept a reassignment to any location as dictated by the needs of the Service.New special agents attend the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center at Glynco, Georgia for 18 weeks of training.  This training includes comprehensive courses in protective techniques, criminal law, use of special investigative equipment, use of firearms, and defensive measures. Rules of evidence, surveillance techniques, undercover operations, and courtroom demeanor are also studied. Classroom study is supplemented with on-the-job training when agents report to their assigned field stations. As agents in training, they assist in carrying out surveillance activities, participating in raids, interviewing witnesses and suspects, searching for physical evidence, seizing contraband, and serving search warrants. The emphasis on training and the vast experience they gain make U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Special Agents among the best wildlife law enforcement professionals in the world.When fully staffed, the Office of Law Enforcement includes 261 Special Agents and 122 WildLife Inspector . Most are "officers on the beat" who report through eight regional law enforcement offices. A headquarters Office of Law Enforcement provides national oversight, support, policy, and guidance for Service investigations and the wildlife inspection program, trains Service law enforcement personnel, fields a special investigations unit, and provides budget, management and administrative support for the Office of Law Enforcement.The Clark R. Bavin National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory conducts scientific analyses that support federal, state, and international investigations of wildlife crime. The Office of Law Enforcement also maintains a National Wildlife Property Repository, which supplies abandoned and forfeited wildlife items to schools, universities, museums, and non-government organizations for public education, and operates the National Eagle Repository, which meets the needs of Native Americans for eagles and eagle feathers for religious use.The National Eagle and Wildlife Property Repository, near Denver, Colorado stores in a 16,000-square-foot (1,486 square meters) warehouse 1.5 million specimens, mainly products made from endangered animals: tiger, rhinoceros, sea turtle, crocodile and elephant. A row of shelves 50 feet long and 10 feet high stores the hides and mounted heads of big cat: cheetah, tiger, jaguar, margay, ocelot and leopard. An objective of the server is assuring the U.S. complies with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The treaty regulates wildlife commerce to assure the survival of threatened species.  The specimens in the repository were seized in customs searches at U.S. ports of entry or being trafficked across state lines.  The facility develops educational programs about wildlife trade, endangered species, and conservation laws.[3]The current Chief of Law Enforcement for the US Fish and Wildlife Service is William Woody.Special Agents enforce laws regarding the conservation and preservation of many plant and animal species throughout the United States and being brought into the country from elsewhere. Special Agents primarily focus on the enforcement of the following federal laws:[4]The Office of Law Enforcement is Headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia. In addition, there are eight regional offices that serve different geographical regions of the U.S.[5]In Operation Chameleon the FWS undertook action against several internationally operating reptile smuggling networks. The investigations led to several convictions.In her book, Hunt for Justice, retired Special Agent Lucinda Schroeder details the Service's undercover program to arrest and convict Alaskan hunting guides who were conducting illegal hunts in Alaska's northern Brooks Range."

Royal Female School of Art;"The Royal Female School of Art was a professional institution for the training of women in art and design. It was founded in 1842, as part of the Government School of Design, predecessor of the Royal College of Art.The Female School of Design was moved in 1849 out of Somerset House, which until then accommodated both male and female classes, and remained in separate premises for the rest of its life, notably in Gower Street from 1852, then Queen Square from 1860. When Henry Cole took over management of the Schools of Design in 1852 he established more advanced and technical classes for women within the senior, central school, which moved to South Kensington in 1858.Many of the students of the Female School during the 1840s and 1850s moved on from Gower Street to study in the more advanced classes, and some of them returned, over the course of the 1850s, to the Female School of Art in Gower Street as teachers.  Others were sent to head up the female branches of government art schools in Edinburgh (Susan Ashworth) and Dublin (Mary Julyan). In 1860 the Female School of Art was put on the same financial basis as other branch Schools of Design, resulting in a reduction in its public subsidy and necessitating a change of location and management while it remained affiliated to the national institution.  These arrangements continued until 1909 when it was transferred to the control of London County Council, initially via the Central School of Art and Design (now part of the University of the Arts London), with which it was merged from 1914.[1]The first Headmistress of the Female School of Art was English artist Fanny McIan, who oversaw the first fifteen years of its life, retiring in 1857.  She was succeeded by Louisa Gann, who had been trained in the Female School of Design, and who, with her core team of teachers trained at South Kensington, managed the Female School of Art throughout its third phase of life, in Queen Square, between 1860 and 1909, and obtained the title Royal Female School of Art in 1885.  The emphasis of tuition, which followed to a great extent, but was not confined to, the 'syllabus' established by the national school at South Kensington, was to equip students to gain an income from work as artists, designers, illustrators and teachers, and many pursued all of these activities in the course of their subsequent careers. In 1894 Louisa Gann claimed in a newspaper interview that the majority of students who had completed the course over the years had found work.  Alumnae who became well-known exhibiting artists include:References can be found to a number of names, including: School of Design for Females, Female School of Design, Gower Street School, Metropolitan School of Art for Females, Royal Female School of Art, Queen Square School of Art, Royal Female School of Art, Government School of Art for Ladies.[2]The Royal Female School of Art Foundation continues to work to support students accessing art education.[3]"
Tavo Hellmund;"Tavo Hellmund (born February 24, 1966 in Mexico City, Mexico) is an American businessman, event promoter and former racing driver. Although he worked for the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, Hellmund is better known for his work in Formula One racing, where he was responsible for both the return of the United States Grand Prix (2012, Austin) and the Mexican Grand Prix (2015), in addition to being a founding partner of Circuit of the Americas.[1][2] As such, he has been described in journalism as the mastermind of the United States Grand Prix, and North America's F1 Hero.[3][4][5][6][7][8]Hellmund won races in FIA Formula Ford and Formula 3, SCCA, Formula Ford, American Sedan, NASCAR Grand National and Late Models, ending his driving career in 2005 due to budget constraints.[9][10]Hellmund has worked in several capacities on dozens of events, including a variety of races such as INDYCAR, IMSA and SCCA. Outside of motorsport his work includes the 1986 World Cup.[11] From 2005–2009, he promoted the Texas Racefest which combined a National USAC Midget Race and a NASCAR Grand National race in the same event.[12] Racefest was a sellout and won his company (Full Throttle Productions) Short Track Promoter of the Year in 2006.[13]Hellmund has had a lifelong relationship with Bernie Ecclestone.[14] In May 2010, Formula One announced that a 10-year deal was made with Hellmund's Full Throttle Productions for the United States Grand Prix to be hosted at Circuit of the Americas outside of Austin, Texas beginning in 2012.[15]Hellmund named the track Circuit of the Americas after a horse track in Mexico City owned by his business partners.[16] He originally sketched the layout of the track on a barbecue napkin back in 2007.[17] After a dispute with one of the COTA investors, Hellmund agreed to being bought out in 2014.[18]In July 2014, Ecclestone confirmed the Mexican Grand Prix would return to the F1 schedule in the 2015 season. Hellmund worked with Alejandro Soberon, chief executive of Grupo CIE, to launch the event.[19] After the first event, John Maher of the Austin American Statesman recounted that, on Sunday November 1, 2015 the Mexican Grand Prix had a race-day attendance of 134,850, and the three-day mark was 335,850. Three-time world champion and former Mercedes chairman Niki Lauda told reporters after the Mexican Grand Prix, "It was the best I've ever seen in my whole life."[20] David Tremayne of The Straits Times wrote, "Now, that's a serious audience. As an object lesson in how to organize a grand prix, Hellmund's team set a new benchmark, and for this, the sport should be grateful".[21] In December 2019 the Mexican Grand Prix was awarded the Formula One Race Promoters' Trophy for a record fifth year in a row.[22]In November 2015, it was reported that Hellmund was considering buying the Manor F1 Team, which was struggling financially, from Stephen Fitzpatrick.[23] Hellmund stated that towards the end of 2016, a consortium led by him had agreed to the purchase on the condition that the team finished the season in 10th place in the Constructors' Championship. This would have guaranteed the team $15 million the following year in prize money. However, Manor lost the position at the Brazilian Grand Prix and the deal fell apart. Manor fell into administration and was out of business two months later.[24]On February 17, 2021 Hellmund, along with former Houston Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and San Antonio Spurs CEO RC Buford announced the pricing of the initial public offering for their special-purpose acquisition company SportsTek listed on the Nasdaq Exchange.[25][26]"

He liked drawing and drew pictures everywhere and had the greatest dream to be an artist.As Ma Liang gets ready for bed one night after looking at all his drawings, an elderly man appeared in his dream and gave him a paintbrush. He informs Ma Liang of the brush's great power and tells him to use it wisely. Before Ma Liang can thank him, the old man disappeared . To test the power, Ma Liang uses the brush to paint a rooster. When he paints the last feather, the rooster comes to life and flies off. Realizing the power of the brush, Ma Liang vows to use it to help others and remembers the words of the old man.From that day on, Ma Liang used the paintbrush to help others with their needs or troubles . Ma Liang later paints rice and fish which came to life .Many people knew about the magic paintbrush, one of which was a powerful man, the emperor , who pays a visit to Ma Liang and invites him to his home. Unknown to Ma Liang, the emperor was a selfish and arrogant bad man who had an idea to steal the paintbrush and make a lot of money by turning things to life and keeping them. When Ma Liang refuses to heed the emperor 's commands to paint a peacock for him due to his promise to the magician to use he brush wisely, he is imprisoned in a dungeon. He took away his brush and invited a lot of his friends to come to his home and shows them the magic paintbrush. He drew a lot of pictures, of which none became real.Realizing in anger that the pictures would become real when Ma Liang paints, the emperor orders his men to send for Ma Liang. He offers Ma Liang his freedom if he paints a mountain of gold. Discovering the emperor's deception, Ma Liang devises a plan to trick the greedy emperor and agrees by telling the emperor to have patience and obey his words. He paints a sea much to the emperor's dismay but Ma Liang assures him that he is trying to make his work impressive. After the boy paints a golden mountain in the distance, the emperor was angry and asks him to paint a ship for him and his men to gather the gold.The emperor and his men hurry aboard the ship. When they are at the middle of the sea, the emperor tells Ma Liang to give him wind to increase the ship's speed. Ma Liang paints a wind cloud and then continues to paint storm clouds. A horrified emperor calls out to Ma Liang to ease the weather saying that he and his men and friends would die. But Ma Liang defies orders and continued to paint more storm clouds. Giant waves crash against the ship and the vessel breaks then sinks, drowning the emperor and his friends.Ma Liang goes back to his simple life and lives happily with his family. He always becomes ready to help everyone in need. Although he continues to do more artworks, he occasionally uses his magic paintbrush. Not a single person dared Ma Liang to use his magic brush for evil purposes and greedy wishes. So the magic paintbrush was known by everyone.The story has been readapted a number of times by Chinese authors, common versions include the story of the same name from author Han Xing as well as Hong Xuntao. The American adaptation titled as "Tye May and the Magic Brush" by Molly Bang features a female protagonist as the title character."

Battle of Kietlanka;"The Battle of Kietlanka[a] was a battle of the January Uprising, fought on 13 May 1863, between the insurrect forces against the forces of the Russian Empire. It was fought near the village of Kietlanka, Poland.On 25 April 1863, following the victorious battle of Stok during the January Uprising, the detachment of the Polish insurgents commanded by lieutenant colonel Ignacy Mystkowski connected with the another group of rebels, and begun marching alongside the railway tracks. The joined formation counted 1200 people, however despite that, it lacked enough firearms and ammunition. As such, they have decided to attack the train transporting three grenadier companies of around 360 soldiers, and weapons, heading to the Małkinia Górna.[1]Before the battle, the insurgents commanded by lieutenant colonel Ignacy Mystkowski had attacked and defeated the Russian squad of soldiers, that was guarding the Małkinia railway station. Later, on the morning of 13 May 1863, near the village of Kietlanka, Poland, the insurgents had laid a trap on the military train removed the steel rails from the railway tracks, replacing them with wooden replicas, planning to derail the upcoming train. Then, several companies of the insurgents placed themselves on one side of track, awaiting the train. However, a few hours hours before the attack, the local flagman, who had previously noticed the insurgent forces passing through that area, had alerted the Russian offices of the possible ambush. As such, the train driver, expecting the possibility of an ambush, begun slowing down the train earlier than scheduled. Due to that, when train reached the trap, only the first few cars derailed.[1]Following the derailment of the train, the insurgents laid heavy fire on the Russian forces inside, commanded by the major general Nikolay Toll. Due to miscalculations made earlier insurgents, that led them to occupy positions only on the one side of the track, the Russian soldiers left the train, and took position behind it, on the opposite side of the track, and begun firing from the gaps between train wheels. In the early stage of the battle, all main leaders of the insurgent forces were killed, which included: Ignacy Mystkowski, Leopold Pluciński, Józef Podbielski, and Władysław Ostaszewski. The fight lasted for the several hours, with neither side being able to gain the upper hand.[1][2]Eventually, the Russian reinforcements, previously stationed near Czyżew, had arrived, tipping the scale of the battle of the Russian side. It included a few rifle companies and a squadron of Cossack host, consisting of around 50 Cossack soldiers. The rebels were pushed back, taking a defensive position, and eventually retreating into the forest. They had also received reinforcements, which allowed them to temporarily withhold Russian attacks. However, eventually, the Cossack squadron managed to bypass the rebel defenses, hitting them from the back, and surrounding them. As such, the insurgents begun to scatter in different directions across the forest, retreating from the fight. By the evening, the remnants of the rebel detachment managed to break through the swamps, retreating from the fight. Russian troops were ordered not to pursue them.[1][2]The battle ended with Russian victory. In the fight were killed 40 Polish insurgents, 25 were wounded, and about 80 were captured. Additionally, an unknown number of them had fled or drowned during the retreat to the swamps. According to the Polish data, around 60 Russian troops were either killed or wounded.[1][2][3]"
Dog coat;"The coat of the domestic dog refers to the hair that covers its body. Dogs demonstrate a wide range of coat colors, patterns, textures, and lengths. As with other mammals, a dog's fur has many uses, including thermoregulation and protection from cuts or scratches, furthermore, a dog's coat plays an important role in the showing of purebred dogs. Breed standards often include a detailed description of the nature and attributes of that breed's ideal coat. A dog's coat is composed of two layers: a top coat of stiff guard hairs that help repel water and shield from dirt, and an undercoat of soft down hairs, to serve as insulation.[1] Dogs with both under coat and top coat are said to have a double coat. Dogs with a single coat have a coat composed solely of guard hairs, with little or no downy undercoat.The terms fur and hair are often used interchangeably when describing a dog's coat, however in general, a double coat, like that of the Newfoundland and most livestock guardian dogs, is referred to as a fur coat, while a single coat, like that of the Poodle, is referred to as a hair coat.Domestic dogs exhibit diverse coat colours and patterns. In many mammals, different colour patterns are the result of the regulation of the Agouti gene, which can cause hair follicles to switch from making black or brown pigments to yellow or nearly white pigments. The most common coat pattern found in modern wolves is agouti, in which the upperside of the body has banded hairs and the underside exhibits lighter shading. The colour yellow is dominant to the colour black and is found in dogs across much of the world and the dingo in Australia.[2]In 2021, a study of whole genome sequences taken from dogs and wolves focused on the genetic relationships between them based on coat colour. The study found that most dog colour haplotypes were similar to most wolf haplotypes, however dominant yellow in dogs was closely related to white in arctic wolves from North America. This result suggests a common origin for dominant yellow in dogs and white in wolves but without recent gene flow, because this clade was found to be genetically basal to the golden jackal and genetically distinct from all other canids. The most recent common ancestor of the golden jackal and the wolf lineage dates back to 2 million years ago. The study proposes that 35,000 years ago there was genetic introgression into the Late Pleistocene grey wolf from a ghost population of an extinct canid which had diverged from the grey wolf lineage over 2 million years ago. This colour diversity could be found 35,000 years ago in wolves and 9,500 years ago in dogs. A closely related haplotype exists among those wolves of Tibet which possess yellow shading in their coats. The study explains the colour relationships between modern dogs and wolves, white wolves from North America, yellow dogs, and yellowish wolves from Tibet. The study concludes that during the Late Pleistocene, natural selection laid the genetic foundation for modern coat colour diversity in dogs and wolves.[2]During evolution of the dog from their wolf ancestors, coat colors in dogs were probably the inadvertent outcome of some other selective process, and were not likely initially selected for intentionally by humans.[3] Research has found that tameness brings associated physical changes, including coat colouring and patterning.[4]Domestic dogs often display the remnants of countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern. The basic principle of countershading is when the animal is lit from above, shadows will be cast on the ventral side of the body. These shadows could provide a predator or prey with visual cues relating to the movement of the animal. By being lighter colored on the ventral side of the body, an animal can counteract this, and thereby fool the predator or prey. An alternative explanation is that the dorsal and ventral sides of an animal experience different selection pressures (from the need to blend into different backgrounds when viewed from above and below) resulting in differing coloration.[5]The same colour may be referred to differently in different breeds. Likewise, a same term may mean different colourations in different breeds.Brown, chocolate and liver are the most common terms used to refer to the bb-dilution of black pigment to a dark brown. Depending on breed and exact shade, terms such as mahogany, midtone brown, grey-brown, blackish brown are used. Sedge and deadgrass are used to describe the desired Chesapeake Bay Retriever color that resembles "that of its working surroundings" as closely as possible.Brown Chesapeake Bay RetrieverRed Australian KelpieDark and light chocolate Labrador RetrieversRed refers to reddish shades of orange, brown, and tan. Terms used include orange, red-gold, cinnamon, alanine kay, tan, and ruby. Genetically a dog called red is usually a clear sable (with little to no eumelanin tipping on hairs) or a ruddy recessive yellow.In some breeds, "red" refers to what would usually be called brown, chocolate, or liver. A "red merle" is always a liver-based merle. In Australian Cattle Dogs, blue stands for a densely ticked liver-based colouration with an overall red-grey appearance.Red Irish SetterRed Chow ChowRed Standard PoodleRuby Cavalier King Charles SpanielRed Australian Cattle DogRed Shiba InuRed Basset Fauve de BretagneRed Cocker SpanielVizslaGold refers specifically to a rich reddish-yellow and its variants, whereas yellow can refer to any shade of yellow and tan. Terms used include yellow-gold, lion-colored, fawn, apricot, wheaten, tawny, straw, yellow-red, mustard, sandy, honey, blond, and lemon. Dogs called golden or yellow tend to be recessive yellow, but can also be sable.Apricot PoodleDark Golden RetrieversYellow DachshundYellow Labrador RetrieverDark Golden Golden RetrieverOrange Pomeranian (dog)Cream refers to a pale yellowish or tannish colour which can be almost white.Pale cream Standard PoodleCream French BulldogCream AkitaFawn typically refers to a yellow, tan, light brown, or cream dog that has a dark melanistic mask.With Weimaraners, fawn refers to their typical brownish grey colouration that with other breeds is usually called lilac.Silver Fawn PugFawn English MastiffFawn Belgian Shepherd MalinoisFawn BoxerFawn BoerboelBlack is a pure black that can get grizzled as the dog ages, or have a tendency to gain a brownish cast when exposed to the elements.NewfoundlandBlack Labrador RetrieverBlack SchipperkeBlack SchnauzerBlue is a cool-toned, metallic grey. It typically means a d/d dilution of black pigment, a grey colouration that is grey from birth, but has a wide range of breed-specific meanings.In Kerry Blue Terriers, Poodles, and Bearded Collies, "blue" refers to colouration that is black at birth and progressively greys out as the dog matures. In Australian Shepherds, Rough Collies, and Shetland Sheepdogs, blue means a blue (black-based) merle. In Australian Silky Terriers, blue means a saddle-type black and tan pattern, where the black parts of the coat progressively fade to a steel grey as the dog matures and in Australian Cattle Dogs, blue stands for a densely ticked black-based colouration with an overall blue-grey appearance.Blue Neapolitan MastiffBlue mixed-breed dogBlue Australian Silky TerrierBlue Australian Cattle DogGrey simply means a grey colouration of any shade. It can be used as an alternative synonym of blue, but tends to mean some other type of grey than the d/d dilution of black. Synonyms include silver, pepper, grizzle, slate, blue-black grey, black and silver, steel. Greys of a dusty or brownish cast are often lilac, a d/d dilution of liver, and this colouration does not have much of a commonly recognised name. Across various breeds, it is called lavender, silver-fawn, isabella, fawn, café au lait or silver beige.In Poodles, a blue is a very slowly fading, very dark steel grey, whereas a silver is a quicker to clear, much lighter grey that can range from a pale platinum to a steel grey. Both are black at birth with minimal markings to indicate future change. Similarly, café au lait is a slower and darker and silver beige a quicker and lighter progressively greying brown, i.e. liver.Lighter and darker fawn WeimaranersSilver Miniature SchnauzerSilver Miniature PoodleIsabella/fawn DobermannWhite: Such a light cream that it is seen and described as pure white, making them distinct from albino dogs. A white dog, as opposed to an albino one, has dark pigment around the eye rims and nose, often coupled with dark-colored eyes. There is often some coat identifiable as cream between the dog's shoulder blades. Extreme piebald dogs can also appear all white, but are caused by a separate factor.White American Eskimo DogWhite Bichon FriséWhite Maltese dogWhite Coton de Tulear puppyWhite Japanese SpitzSamoyed dogWest Highland White TerrierThe same pattern may be referred to differently in different breeds.Basset HoundDogs demonstrate an enormous diversity in coat length and texture, from the very short and smooth coat seen in the vizslas, to the wiry coat of a Scottish Terrier and the corded coat of the Puli and the Komondor.Generally, coats vary along three categories: length (long vs. short), texture (curly vs. straight), and coarseness (wire-haired vs. non-wire). These three categories all interact with one another, thus, one can see a short, curly, and wired coat in the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, and a long, straight, and non-wired coat in the Pomeranian.[8]Additionally, breeds show variation in patterns of growth - that is to say, parts of the dog's body where the coat may be longer or shorter. The same gene that controls wiriness of hair also causes furnishings to be present (e.g. beard, moustache, eyebrows) [8] - compare the bearded collie, furnishings present, to the border collie, which lacks furnishings. Some breeds show feathering: fringes of longer hair on the ears, belly, tail, and back of the legs (e.g., Saluki and any of the setters).Dogs also vary in the thickness of the undercoat. Some dogs have only a single (rather than a double) coat, or a very reduced undercoat (e.g. the Vizsla), which results in a thinner coat. Certain breeds, especially spitz-type breeds, tend to have a thicker undercoat, which helps retain heat in cold and wet weather.Furthermore, complete hairlessness on parts of the body is present in breeds such as the Chinese Crested or the Xoloitzcuintli.Shedding of hair can occur continuously, but in many breeds is strongly influenced by hormones. Seasonal shedders shed most in spring and fall, following an increase or decrease in day length, and least in summer and winter, in response to constant day length. Cold temperatures stimulate hair growth, so that the heaviest shedding is in spring on dogs living in cold climates. Artificial lighting can alter the seasonal shedding pattern of dogs who live indoors. Other hormonal influences include dietary factors, reproductive hormones in intact dogs, and various medical conditions and disorders. Shedding that is done in a short period of time is known as "blowing the coat" or "blowing coat".[9][10] Among the other coat types, dogs with fine silky coats (e.g., spaniels) are generally moderate shedders, those with an intermediate coat texture (e.g., mountain dogs) are generally heavy shedders, and those with thick stand-offish coats (e.g., spitzes) are generally very heavy shedders."Non-shedding" dogs have greatly-reduced shedding due to alterations to the hair follicle growth cycle:"[D]ogs are a relevant source of allergens, but diagnosing dog-related allergies may present difficulties .."[11] Some dog breeds have been promoted as hypoallergenic (which means less allergic, not free of allergens) because they shed very little. However, no canine is known to be completely nonallergenic. Often the problem is with the dog's saliva or dander, not the fur.[12] Although breeds such as poodles, bedlingtons, bichons, yorkies, and wire-haired terriers are commonly represented as being hypoallergenic due to reduced shedding, the reaction that an individual person has to an individual dog may vary greatly. In a report, describing dog allergen extracts of dog hair, belonging to patients' dogs or from dogs of the same breed, with low molecular mass that are absent in extracts of commercial allergen test kits, it has been found that "[f]actors related to individual dogs seem to influence the allergenicity more than breed or gender."[11]The nature and quality of a purebred dog's coat is important to the dog fancy in the judging of the dog at conformation shows. The exact requirements are detailed in each breed's breed standard and do not generalise in any way, and the terminology may be very different even when referring to similar features. See individual breed articles for specific information.A dog's coat is an outward indicator of internal well-being.[13] For this reason, coat health is an important aspect of pet care to many dog owners.[13] Dog coats can be impacted by nutritional components from the diet.[14] Below is a table that summarizes the effects of several nutrients (minerals, vitamins) on the domestic canine coat, based on current evidence:    Zinc contributes to hair growth and can prevent hair from becoming dry and brittle.[15] In addition to, zinc when supplemented in combination with linoleic acids has been found to improve the coat of canines by reducing water loss in the trans-epidermal layer of the skin.[22] Dogs can obtain zinc in their diet, through the addition of various ingredients, including, red meats, whole grains, poultry by-product meals, and fish meals.Copper is a trace mineral that is required in the diet of canines at 7.3 mg/kg.[23] Copper is involved in multiple enzymatic pathways. In dogs, a lack of copper in the diet, leading to a copper deficiency, results in incomplete keratinization.[16] This leads to a dry coat, hypo-pigmentation, and discoloration of the coat.[16]Selenium is another one of the many trace minerals essential for a dog's diet. Selenium is typically required in lower levels in comparison to other minerals. It is involved in the prevention of oxidative damage as well as the production of anti-oxidants.[17] Selenium aids in the promotion of coat growth.[24] Lack of selenium in the diet of a dog can contribute to the occurrence of sparse coat growth.[25] Dogs can obtain selenium in their diet through the addition of various ingredients including, tuna fish, halibut, sardines, beef, chicken, and egg.Vitamin A deficiency can lead to rough coat, scaling of skin, and other dermatitis issues like alopecia.[19] It is also essential for cells to properly proliferate keratinocytes,[19] which are epithelial cells that produce keratin on the outermost layer of the skin for the cortisol cells of the hair follicle.[20] A deficiency in vitamin A can cause the common symptoms of dermatitis (dry, scaling skin and dull coat).[26]Vitamin B7, also known as biotin, is a water-soluble nutrient that is known to play a role associated with the maintenance and development of hair starting from the follicle. Although it has not been clinically shown to improve hair growth with supplementation alone, it has been shown to reverse deficiency in dogs born deficient.[27]Symptoms of biotin deficiency include alopecia and achromotrichia. A clinical study of biotin showed the importance of biotin in coat pigmentation. There different stages of hair development, as shown in clinical studies using mice.[21] Each stage of hair development has a different sensitivity to biotin present in the body. For example, the shaft development is not greatly affected by biotin access.[21] During the last stage, the amount of biotin available for use by the body will alter the success of that development greatly.[21] Throughout the hair development, most stages of growth are completed, but it was found that in the last stage, where biotin levels were insufficient, there was an incorrect keratinization of the root of the hair, causing the hair to fall out of the body.[21]The supplementation of biotin cannot reverse affects caused by deficiency, but as soon as supplementation is given and biotin levels are restored to adequacy, the body begins to produce the usual hair growth and color it would before the deficiency took place.[21]Polyunsaturated fatty acids found in the diet play a critical role in the maintenance of a healthy coat in dogs, and have even been shown to improve coat condition when supplemented in the diet.[14] Furthermore, diets lacking essential fatty acids in their diet will manifest as unkept, matted coat.[13] Omega fatty acids 3 and 6 are highly unsaturated fatty acids, making them especially metabolically active.[28]The proper combination of these omega fatty acids is crucial to achieve optimal benefits. Proper omega 6:3 ratios have been shown to diminish allergy triggered immune responses, thus improving overall coat condition.[29] The National Research Council (NRC) recommends a 2.6:1 to 26:1 omega 6:3 ratio for adult dog maintenance diets.[30] The proper ratio of these fatty acids is crucial because each has an opposing role in inflammation within the body and both compete for the same enzymatic pathway.[13] Dogs, like many mammals, lack the desaturase enzymes capable of interconverting omega 3 and 6 fatty acids.[28] Therefore, the amount of inflammation in the body is dependent on the ratio between omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. Too little inflammation suppresses the immune system and the body's ability to heal, however excessive inflammation can irritate the skin and reduce the coat's overall appearance.[13]Aside from omega fatty acids, lipid content in the canine diet is an important aspect of coat health.[13] The fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) require lipids present in the diet for absorption, transport and deposition in canine adipose tissue.[31] The specific role of vitamins A and E for coat health are explored elsewhere in this article, as they pertain to immune function.[31] Another pet food regulating body, the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), recommends that Vitamin E supplementation increase as polyunsaturated fatty acids are added to diet in order to counteract lipid oxidation and maintain the potency.[23] In addition, high fat diets in dogs were shown to dramatically improve coat sheen and appearance.[13] It is thought excess cholesterol esters are incorporated into the hair follicle, leading to the improved coat appearance.[13] The same study, by Kirby, Hester and Bauer (2007), stated the optimal approach to an improved coat in dogs is a combination of increased dietary fat and the proper amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids.[13]Omega 3 fatty acid, also known as linolenic acid, is an anti-inflammatory compound.[29] Linolenic acid is found in the oil from flaxseeds, soybean and canola.[29] Some better known examples of linolenic acid are the metabolic derivatives eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). EPA inhibits the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which prevents the synthesis of arachidonic acid which is an inflammatory omega 6.[32] DHA acts even earlier in omega 6 metabolism, by inhibiting delta-6-desaturase.[32] The anti-inflammatory properties of omega 3s stem from their ability to inhibit the inflammatory action of omega 6 fatty acids. A functional minimum has not been set forth by AAFCO, as one has yet to be determined.[23] A reduction in inflammation of somatic tissues, skin especially, supports coat health.[13]Omega 6 fatty acid, also known as linoleic acid, is found in poultry fat and the oil from safflower, sunflower, corn and flaxseed.[29] Arachidonic acid is a well known metabolic derivative of linoleic acid, found only in animal sources.[29] As mentioned above, arachindonic acid is a pro-inflammatory compound.[32] It is critical to note once again that canines are unable to interconvert between omega fatty acids and over supplying linoleic acid promotes excessive inflammation in the body, which can potentially reverse the coat benefits seen by supplying omega fatty acids in the diet. In contrast, linoleic acid is also required for epidermal lipid function and water retention, which benefits coat shine.[22][29] Having linoleic acid present in the diet has demonstrated a positive effect on skin, and thus by extension, coat.[13]"

Riverview Park Plat Historic District;"The Riverview Park Plat Historic District is located in the north-central section of Des Moines, Iowa, United States.  It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1996.[1]In 1886 the Riverview Park Company bought two tracts of land from Wesley and Anne Redhead, who had owned the property for a number of years as an investment.  The purchase price was $12,500.[2]  There was a great deal of real estate development in Des Moines at this time.  However, their expectations were greater than the market.  While the lots were expensive, the eight lots on the north side with their panoramic vistas of the Des Moines River sold quickly.  The lots south of Arlington Avenue sold more slowly.  In 1891 lot 13 was further divided into three lots and was named Jackson's Subdivision.  Two years later lots 9 and 10 were subdivided into 13 lots and renamed Arlington Place.Riverview Park Plat was intended to be an upscale development.  Lot owners who wanted to sell their property were required to offer the lots, or their shares of stock in the company, to those who had already invested in the development. If no one made an offer then the lot owner could place the property on the open market.  Riverview Park is the earliest known example of a restrictive residential covenant in Des Moines.[2]Large houses were in fact built in the upper and upper-middle-class neighborhood.  Until the 1960s only a few of the houses had been converted from single family to multi-family dwellings.  As the homes continued to age they also deteriorated and more were converted into multi-family housing.  In the 1980s the neighborhood was classified as slum-blight by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.The Riverview Park Plat Historic District includes some of the largest architecturally ambitious houses in Des Moines at that time.[2]  The Queen Anne and Colonial Revival were the predominant architectural styles employed.  There were also examples of eclectic architecture that combined the Colonial Revival, American Four Square, Tudor Revival and American Craftsman styles.  Several of Des Moines’ architectural firms Liebbe, Nourse & Rasmussen, Wetherell and Gage, C. C. Cross & Company and Hallett and Rawson, had their designs built in RiverviewRiverview Park Plat was one of several naturalistic suburban subdivisions that were developed in Des Moines during the 1880s.[2]  Frank Pelton, civil engineer of Des Moines, laid out the plat.  Its focus is the curve of the Des Moines River.  Arlington Avenue follows a curvilinear course that parallels the river.  It also contained an island park, which no longer exists.  The street's width also adds to the park-like nature of the area.  It is 75 feet (23 m) wide while most of Des Moines’ streets at the time were 50 feet (15 m) wide."

Lily Alice Lefevre;"Lily Alice Lefevre (5 April 1854 – 17 October 1938) was a Canadian writer whose literary work closely linked her to her hometown of Vancouver. Her book of poems Lion's Gate and Other Verses (1895) was the first book written by a woman and published by a British Columbia publisher, Province Publishing.[1] She was born in Kingston, Ontario. As a teenager she received a medal for writing the best poem about a carnival in Montreal, which continued to be a theme in many of her later poems.Lefevre arrived in Vancouver in 1886 with her husband, a CPR district surgeon Dr. John Lefevre. Her husband died in 1906.[1] In 1889, the title poem of her book first appeared in The Vancouver Daily World as The Lions' Gateway, and was published under her pen name, Fleurange. One of Lefevre's sonnets was published in a book of poetry edited by Lord Dufferin who was Governor General of Canada from 1872 to 1878.[1]Lefevre organized the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire upon the occasion of the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. She was co-founder of the Vancouver Art Gallery. In 1934 she donated $5,000 for a scholarship and gold medal to the University of British Columbia in honor of and to commemorate her husband J.M. Lefevre. Her book The Lion's Gate was first published in 1895, but was re-launched in 1903 along with The Beaver and the Empress. In 1936, it was again re-printed for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the city of Vancouver. In 1921, A Garden By The Sea appeared. Her poem March on! Canada! was set to music by Harold Craxton.[2][3]Source:[4]Works by Lefevre are included in these books:[5]"
2015 Drake Bulldogs football team;"The 2015 Drake Bulldogs football team represented Drake University as a member of the Pioneer Football League (PFL) during 2015 NCAA Division I FCS football season. Led by second-year head coach Rick Fox, the Bulldogs compiled an overall record of 5–6 with a mark of 4–4 in conference play, placing in a three-way tie for fourth in the PFL. The team played its home games at Drake Stadium in Des Moines, Iowa."
George Pilcher (MP);"George Pilcher (26 February 1882 - 8 December 1962) was a British journalist and politician, who served as the Conservative MP for Penryn and Falmouth in 1924–29, and as a member of the Indian Central Legislative Assembly in 1924.Pilcher was born in Folkestone, the son of Walter Pilcher, a grocer.[1] He was educated at Kent College, Canterbury, and then at Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied modern history. He then trained as a barrister, qualifying at the Inner Temple.[2]In 1907, he joined the Morning Post, first working as the private secretary to the editor, Fabian Ware, and then becoming foreign editor in 1909. While with the Post, he reported extensively from overseas, including with the Ottoman army in the First Balkan War. He then moved to India in 1914, where he became joint editor of the Statesman, as well as a foreign correspondent for the Post. At the Statesman, he reported from the Waziristan campaign of 1920 and the royal tour of 1921.[2]In 1924, Pilcher was elected to the Central Legislative Assembly, the Indian colonial parliament.[3] He was one of the two members representing the "European"  constituency in the Bengal Presidency. He resigned the seat in August.[4]Later that year, in the 1924 United Kingdom general election, he returned to the UK where he was elected for Penryn and Falmouth as a Conservative, defeating the incumbent Liberal. During his time in the Commons, he was involved in overseas affairs, part of a delegation visiting Brazil in 1927, and the British delegation to the 1928 Empire Parliamentary Conference in Canada. After standing down at the 1929 United Kingdom general election (he did not seek re-election), he became secretary of the Royal Empire Society, retiring from that post in 1935.[2] His successor as Conservative candidate for Penryn and Falmouth in 1929, Maurice Petherick, was defeated by the Liberal, Tudor Walters.[5]"
Dommershausen;"Dommershausen is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis (district) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kastellaun, whose seat is in the like-named town.The municipality lies in the Hunsrück. The main centre, also called Dommershausen, lies on a ridge between the Baybach and Lützbach valleys. It has 451 inhabitants (as at 30 June 2009).Places near Dommershausen, including unincorporated ones, are Heyweiler, Sabershausen, Lahr, Lieg, Lütz, Eveshausen, Dorweiler, Macken and Beulich.Along with the main centre of Dommershausen, the municipality includes the three outlying Ortsteile of Dorweiler, Eveshausen and Sabershausen.In 1220, Dommershausen had its first documentary mention as Dumershusen. What the mention reveals is that Dumershusen was not subject to any kind of taxation. The village belonged to the Beltheim Court and thereby lay under three lordships: the Electorate of Trier, the Counts of Sponheim and the Lords of Braunshorn. After this last family died out, their share in the Court passed to the family Winneburg, and after this family also died out, the share passed to the family Metternich. Beginning in 1794, Dommershausen lay under French rule. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.The municipality in its current form came into being on 17 March 1974 through the amalgamation of the old municipality of Dommershausen with the three formerly self-administering municipalities of Dorweiler, Eveshausen and Sabershausen.The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:[3]Dommershausen’s mayor is Dietmar Emmerich.[1]The municipality’s arms might be described thus: Quarterly, first azure a cross moline argent, second chequy of sixteen gules and argent, third argent three escallops sable and fourth gules three arming buckles pommy each surmounting the last in bend, sans tongues.Dommershausen’s former rectory from 1837/1838 has since 1992 housed the Vorderhunsrückmuseum (“Fore-Hunsrück Museum”), the Pies Archive and the Library for Personal and Municipal History. Permanent exhibits document the surgeons and Knochenflicker (“bone-menders”) from the family Pies as well as medical instruments from the past two millennia.There are also changing exhibits about the Vorderhunsrück’s history. Gathered at the library are data from church books from the 16th to 19th century from some 1,400 places, particularly from the Rhine-Moselle-Nahe-Saar region, and also regional historical literature.In 2001, the Jugendraum – a youth centre – was opened in Dommershausen, at the same time as the new fire station. The mayor described the opening as a great stride for the municipality of Dommershausen.The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate’s Directory of Cultural Monuments:[4]"
Millisecond pulsar;"A millisecond pulsar (MSP) is a pulsar with a rotational period less than about 10 milliseconds. Millisecond pulsars have been detected in radio, X-ray, and gamma ray portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The leading theory for the origin of millisecond pulsars is that they are old, rapidly rotating neutron stars that have been spun up or "recycled" through accretion of matter from a companion star in a close binary system.[1][2] For this reason, millisecond pulsars are sometimes called recycled pulsars.Millisecond pulsars are thought to be related to low-mass X-ray binary systems. It is thought that the X-rays in these systems are emitted by the accretion disk of a neutron star produced by the outer layers of a companion star that has overflowed its Roche lobe. The transfer of angular momentum from this accretion event can theoretically increase the rotation rate of the pulsar to hundreds of times per second, as is observed in millisecond pulsars.There has been recent evidence that the standard evolutionary model fails to explain the evolution of all millisecond pulsars, especially young millisecond pulsars with relatively high magnetic fields, e.g. PSR B1937+21. Bülent Kiziltan and S. E. Thorsett (UCSC) showed that different millisecond pulsars must form by at least two distinct processes.[3] But the nature of the other process remains a mystery.[4]Many millisecond pulsars are found in globular clusters. This is consistent with the spin-up theory of their formation, as the extremely high stellar density of these clusters implies a much higher likelihood of a pulsar having (or capturing) a giant companion star.  Currently there are approximately 130 millisecond pulsars known in globular clusters.[5] The globular cluster Terzan 5 contains 37 of these, followed by 47 Tucanae with 22 and M28 and M15 with 8 pulsars each.Millisecond pulsars, which can be timed with high precision, have a stability comparable to atomic-clock-based time standards when averaged over decades.[6][7] This also makes them very sensitive probes of their environments. For example, anything placed in orbit around them causes periodic Doppler shifts in their pulses' arrival times on Earth, which can then be analyzed to reveal the presence of the companion and, with enough data, provide precise measurements of the orbit and the object's mass. The technique is so sensitive that even objects as small as asteroids can be detected if they happen to orbit a millisecond pulsar. The first confirmed exoplanets, discovered several years before the first detections of exoplanets around "normal" solar-like stars, were found in orbit around a millisecond pulsar, PSR B1257+12. These planets remained, for many years, the only Earth-mass objects known outside of the Solar System. One of them, PSR B1257+12 D, has an even smaller mass, comparable to that of the Moon, and is still today the smallest-mass object known beyond the Solar System.[8]The first millisecond pulsar, PSR B1937+21, was discovered in 1982 by Backer et al.[9] Spinning roughly 641 times per second, it remains the second fastest-spinning millisecond pulsar of the approximately 200 that have been discovered.[10] Pulsar PSR J1748-2446ad, discovered in 2004, is, as of 2021, the fastest-spinning pulsar currently known, spinning 716 times per second.[11][12]Current theories of neutron star structure and evolution predict that pulsars would break apart if they spun at a rate of c. 1500 rotations per second or more,[13][14] and that at a rate of above about 1000 rotations per second they would lose energy by gravitational radiation faster than the accretion process would accelerate them.[15]In early 2007 data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and INTEGRAL spacecraft discovered a neutron star XTE J1739-285 rotating at 1122 Hz.[16] The result is not statistically significant, with a significance level of only 3 sigma. While it is an interesting candidate for further observations, current results are inconclusive.  Still, it is believed that gravitational radiation plays a role in slowing the rate of rotation. One X-ray pulsar that spins at 599 revolutions per second, IGR J00291+5934, is a prime candidate for helping detect such waves in the future (most such X-ray pulsars only spin at around 300 rotations per second)."
St. John's East (provincial electoral district);"St. John's East was a provincial electoral district for the House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. In 2011 there were 8,063 eligible voters living within the district.[1] The district was abolished in 2015 as Newfoundland and Labrador reduced the number of districts. Portions of the district are now within the district of St. John's East-Quidi Vidi.Prior to 1956, the district was larger and elected two MHAs.The district has elected the following Members of the House of Assembly:For MHAs elected to the old St. John's East between 1956 and 1995 see Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi[2]"

MGP of Indiana;"MGP of Indiana (Midwest Grain Products of Indiana[1]), formerly known as LDI (Lawrenceburg Distillers Indiana), is a distillery in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, producing spirits for private label sale.[2][3]  These are sold under about 50 different brand names by various bottling companies, with a recent addition of their own products, Till Vodka, George Remus Bourbon, and Rossville Union Straight Rye Whiskey.[4][5] The facility's largest customer is the London-based multinational beverage giant Diageo.[6]The distillery was founded in 1847[citation needed] and purchased by Seagram in 1933.[7] While under their ownership, the distillery was called the Jos. E. Seagram Lawrenceburg Plant. When Seagram's assets were acquired by other companies, the Lawrenceburg distillery became the property of Pernod Ricard.On April 19, 2006, Pernod Ricard announced plans to close the distillery, but instead sold it in 2007 to CL Financial, a holding company based in Trinidad and Tobago, which renamed it "Lawrenceburg Distillers Indiana" (LDI). CL Financial later collapsed and required government intervention, although the facility continued to operate through the company crisis.In October 2011, MGP Ingredients announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase the distillery, giving it its present name.[8] As of 2012[update], Diageo is the distillery's biggest customer.[6]MGP of Indiana has seven whiskey brands of its own as of April 2021, including George Remus bourbon[9] and Rossville Union, but primarily sells its output to various bottlers.[10] One primary product of MGP Indiana is a straight rye whiskey with a 95% rye mash bill, which is bottled under various brand names, including Angel's Envy, Bulleit Rye, Filibuster, George Dickel Rye, James E. Pepper, Smooth Ambler, and Templeton Rye.[10][6] It also produces straight Bourbon whiskey, which is sold under various brand names, such as the Cougar Bourbon brand sold in Australia. These straight whiskeys are also used as the straight whiskey components in Seagram's Seven Crown, a blended whiskey now produced by Diageo, and High West.[11] The distillery also produces neutral spirits used in the production of Seagram-branded gin and vodka, now owned by Pernod Ricard.In April 2013, MGP announced the introduction of six additional mash bills for rye, malt, wheat and bourbon whiskey to expand the range of product offerings for the Indiana facility.[12][2]Altogether, MGP is the source of beverage spirits sold under about 50 different brand names, although these are often sold misleadingly by their bottlers as distinctive products with minimal disclosure of the actual source of the spirits.[10] Some industry experts have commented negatively about the practice, such as the whiskey writer Charles Cowdery who has decried such bottlers as "Potemkin distilleries".[10] As one example, in a class action settlement announced in 2015 about the marketing of the Templeton Rye brand which was actually produced using MGP spirits, Templeton was required to add the words "distilled in Indiana" to its label and remove claims of using a "Prohibition Era Recipe" and "small batch" production. The settlement also offered refunds to customers who had bought Templeton Rye since 2006.[13]Some brands modify the facility's products somewhat before bottling and selling them. George Dickel Rye, introduced in 2012, is mashed, distilled and aged in Indiana at MGP, and then trucked to the Diageo bottling plant in Plainfield, Illinois for filtering and bottling.[6][14] Angel's Envy finishes its spirits in old port wine casks before bottling.[10]MGP also produces plant-based protein. In 2021, MGP was ranked 31st on FoodTalks's Global Top Plant Protein Companies list.[15]"

Hydroelectricity in the United Kingdom;"As of 2018[update], hydroelectric power stations in the United Kingdom accounted for 1.87 GW of installed electrical generating capacity, being 2.2% of the UK's total generating capacity and 4.2% of UK's renewable energy generating capacity. This includes four conventional hydroelectric power stations and run-of-river schemes for which annual electricity production is approximately 5,000 GWh, being about 1.3% of the UK's total electricity production.[2] There are also pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations providing a further 2.8 GW of installed electrical generating capacity, and contributing up to 4,075 GWh of peak demand electricity annually.[3]The potential for further practical and viable hydroelectricity power stations in the UK is estimated to be in the region of 146 to 248 MW for England and Wales,[4] and up to 2,593 MW for Scotland.[5]Interest in hydropower in the UK rose in the early 2010s due to UK and EU targets for reductions in carbon emissions and the promotion of renewable energy power generation through commercial incentives such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate scheme (ROCs) and feed-in tariffs (FITs). Before such schemes, studies to assess the available hydro resources in the UK had discounted many sites for reasons of poor economic or technological viability, but studies in 2008 and 2010 by the British Hydro Association (BHA) identified a larger number of viable sites, due to improvements in the available technology and the economics of ROCs and FITSs.[4][5] However, during the same period there have been significant reductions in costs of other renewable energy sources such as Offshore Wind and Photovoltaics,[6] this has resulted in reduced competitiveness of large scale Hydroelectric schemes in the UK. There are no large scale Hydroelectric scheme planned in the UK as of 2020. However, it is predicted that pumped storage will play an increasingly important role in the UK electricity grid in future years as more intermittent sources of electricity generation come on line.[7]Schemes up to 50 kW are eligible for FITs, and schemes over 5 MW are eligible for ROCs. Schemes between 50 kW and 5 MW can choose between either. The UK Government's National Renewable Energy Action Plan of July 2010 envisaged between 40 and 50 MW of new hydropower schemes being installed annually up to 2020. The most recent feedback for new hydro schemes is for 2009, and only about 15 MW of new hydropower was installed during that year.[2]United Kingdom gross electricity supplied from Hydro between 1920 and 2012 (GWh), including for pumped-storage schemes.[3]United Kingdom annual electricity generation from hydroelectricity between 1990 and 2012 (GW hours), excluding pumped-storage schemes.[1]United Kingdom net installed hydroelectricity capacity between 1990 and 2012 (MW), excluding pumped-storage schemes.[1]Related Lists Related UK pagesOther relatedScottish Hydro Electric"
Lee Eon;"Lee Eon (5 February 1981 – 21 August 2008) was a South Korean actor and model.Lee Eon was born Park Sang-min on 5 February 1981. Lee began practicing ssireum while in elementary school, going on to win gold medals at Korean national ssireum competitions in 1997 and 1998. As a freshman at university, he was inspired by Cha Seung-won to become a model, and after losing 30 kg (66 lb) made his debut at a fashion show in Busan in 1999. His later fashion show appearances included the Seoul Fashion Artists Association Collection.[1]Lee branched out into acting, making his film debut in 2006,[2] he played a ssireum wrestler in Like a Virgin, putting his skills to good use and helping lead actor Ryu Deok-hwan learn the moves.[3] He later appeared in the 2007 hit drama series Coffee Prince, and made his final appearance in KBS period drama Strongest Chil Woo.[2]Lee died in a motorcycle accident on 21 August 2008. He had been riding home from a party celebrating the airing of the last episode of Strongest Chil Woo, when his motorcycle hit the guardrail of an overpass in Hannam-dong, Seoul, at around 2 a.m. He died at the scene from a broken neck and was taken to the nearby Soonchunhyang University Hospital.[1][2] Many of his colleagues attended his funeral, including Gong Yoo, his co-star in Coffee Prince, who took leave from his military service to hold Lee's memorial tablet in the procession to the grave site.[4]This article about a Korean actor is a stub.

Black Chalk;"Black Chalk is the debut novel by English author Christopher J. Yates published in 2013 by Harvill Secker. It was named a 'Best Book of the Year' by NPR in 2015.[1] Set between the University of Oxford and New York City where the author both studied and where he now lives.The story has two main threads, firstly set in fictional Pitt College in the University of Oxford in 1990 and secondly set in Manhattan 14 years later. The main protagonists are students Chad - a shy American exchange student and the charismatic Jolyon, who becomes friends at University and gather in friends Emilia, Dee, Mark and Jack. The six become embroiled in a game of dares and consequences, with the enigmatic Tallest, Middle and Shortest, members of the Game Soc, who police the game and enforce its rules - 10,000 pounds is the cash prize. One by one the players lose resulting in one of their deaths.  The  remaining two members, Chad and Jolyon meet up again 14 years later in New York to decide on the winner...Dennis Drabelle writing in The Washington Post enjoyed the premise: "A circle of bright college friends who feed on one another's cleverness and trump one another's insults until the steady diet of cynicism ends in tragedy - this is the stuff of two fine first novels: Donna Tartt's The Secret History (1992) and, now, Christopher J. Yates's Black Chalk. Yates's characters are even wittier than Tartt's, but then, as undergraduates at Oxford University, they would be, wouldn't they?" and concludes that "Like a locked-room mystery, a boarding-school or college novel reduces the world to a compartment filled with quasi-incestuous conflict. By adding gamesmanship and mental illness to the mix, Yates has achieved something new and impressive."[2]Marcel Berlins also praises the novel: "Black Chalk is an inventive and intricate psychological puzzle thriller that mystifies, torments, disturbs, beguiles and occasionally irritates...A touch pretentious, in parts overcomplicated, Black Chalk is nevertheless a powerfully intelligent debut for Christopher J. Yates."[3]Jason Sheehan in NPR praises Yates "who writes like he has 30 books behind him, like he's been doing this so long that lit games and deviltry come to him as natural as breathing...This is the smart summer thriller you've been waiting for. The black and harmful little book you want in your carry-on. The novel you should be reading tonight. Because The Game never really ends. It's out there, just waiting for you to make the first move."[4]Kirkus Reviews is generally impressed: "Yates’ unreliable narrator makes the story a puzzle in itself, and while frustrating, it’s all fun and games…right? Parts of this story are downright unrealistic, you won’t get much character development, and key elements are left unexplained, but if you’re in this for the game, you’ll leave satisfied. You can’t help but admire how Yates slowly unravels his players’ safety nets—their minds—one roll of the dice at a time."[5]"

Chandoo Mondeti;"Chandoo Mondeti is an Indian film director and screenwriter who works in Telugu cinema. He has directed films like Karthikeya (2014), Premam (2016), Bloody Mary (2022), and Karthikeya 2 (2022).[1][2] For his work on Karthikeya, he was nominated for "Best Director – Telugu" at the 62nd Filmfare Awards South and the 1st IIFA Utsavam awards.Chandoo Mondeti was born in Vemuluru near Kovvur in Andhra Pradesh. He debuted as a director with Karthikeya in 2014. It was a mystery thriller film starring Nikhil Siddhartha and Swathi Reddy in the lead roles. The film revolves showcases the life of a curious medico Karthik who investigates the mystery surrounding a closed Karthikeya temple in the village of Subrahmanyapuram.[3][4] An incident which happened in Talupulamma Temple in Kakinada district of Andhra Pradesh inspired Chandoo Mondeti to pen the story of Karthikeya. The film released on 24 October 2014 as a Diwali release to positive reviews from critics, and collected more than ₹20 crore, on a budget of ₹4–6 crore.[5][6][7]He then directed Premam (2016), a remake of 2015 Malayalam film of the same name. The film was commercially successful. Later he directed Savyasachi (2018) starring Naga Chaitanya and Madhavan (in his Telugu debut) which did not perform well at the box office.  He later directed the crime drama film Bloody Mary (2022) stars Nivetha Pethuraj, Brahmaji, Ajay, and Kireeti Damaraju. Set in Visakhapatnam, the plot follows three orphaned childhood friends—Mary, Raju, and Basha who find themselves embroiled in a murder case. The film was digitally released on 15 April 2022 on the streaming platform Aha. His next project Karthikeya 2, the sequel to Karthikeya, was officially launched in March 2020 in Tirupati with a puja ceremony.[8] Filming took place in India, predominantly in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, in addition to Spain, Portugal, and Greece in Europe.[9][10] It starred Nikhil Siddhartha, Anupama Parameswaran, and Anupam Kher in prominent roles.

Onias I;"Onias I (Hebrew: חוניו , Honiyya or Honio ben Jaddua) was the son of the Jaddua mentioned in Nehemiah.[1] According to Josephus, this Jaddua is said to have been a contemporary of Alexander the Great (reigned 336-323 BCE).[2] I Maccabees regards Onias as a contemporary of the Spartan king Areus I (309-265 BCE).[3] "Josephus is ... mistaken in placing it in the time of Onias III instead of Onias I, who was high priest c. 300 B.C. (cf. Ant. xi. 347)."[4]Simon the Just extolled in the Wisdom of Sirach[5] (according to the Hebrew text the son of Jonathan, but according to the Greek text the son of Onias) and in legend was probably the son of Onias I or, according to some, of the latter's grandson Onias II."
William Theophilus Dortch;"William Theophilus Dortch (August 23, 1824 – November 21, 1889) was an American politician who served as a Confederate States senator from North Carolina from 1862 to 1865.Dortch was born August 23, 1824[1] to William Dortch and his wife, Drusilla at his father's plantation, situated in Nash County, North Carolina about 5 miles from the town of Rocky Mount, North Carolina.[2]Dortch was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly from 1852 to 1861. In 1860 Dortch served as Speaker of the House of Commons.[1] During the Civil War, Dortch served as a senator from North Carolina in the First Confederate Congress and the Second Confederate Congress (from 1862 to 1865). During his term, Dortch was accused of sexual improprieties with a minor, but was exonerated after an investigation.[citation needed] After the war, he again served in the legislature, first in the North Carolina House of Representatives, and then in the North Carolina Senate from 1879 to 1885. He was President pro tempore of that body from 1881 to 1883.Dortch died November 21, 1889[3] in Goldsboro, North Carolina and was buried in Willow Dale Cemetery.[4]Dortch married Elizabeth Pittman of Edgecombe County, North Carolina, they had seven children.  Dortch later married Hattie Williams of Berryville, Virginia, they had four children.[3]This article incorporates facts obtained from: Lawrence Kestenbaum, The Political Graveyard bio"
The Monster Bed;"The Monster Bed is a 1987 children's book by Jeanne Willis and illustrated by Susan Varley that revolves around the twist on the common "monsters under the bed" story  that frighten children. The book is a young reader, normally aimed for 4 years or older. The main character, the monster Dennis, believes that human children are under his bed and will get him as he falls asleep. His mother, however, tries to get him to go to sleep. Eventually, a human child accidentally ventures into their home cave, and both the human and Dennis discover each other, frightening both.The book was aimed at decreasing the fear of night in children by basically telling them that monsters were just as afraid of humans as humans were of monsters. The book received good reviews after it came out, with hardly any review lower than a 75% rating on any book review site. Some of the books came with an extra plush toy of Dennis with his pillow and teddy bear in each arm.An animated adaptation of the book was broadcast on September 9, 1989, as one of the ABC Weekend Specials.[1] Various liberties were taken with the adaptation such as Dennis’ name being changed to Trashy and having an antagonist.The introduction starts the book in the setting of a small picnic of a human and his dog. The human is apparently telling the reader to not venture into the Withering Wood, a forest of trees rumored to have legendary creatures such as "hairy trolls, nasty gnomes, and scary pixies and fairies."[2]The book then changes setting into inside the forest, where we see a small monster named Dennis and his mother,[3] showing that Dennis was very polite for a young monster. It describes Dennis's fear of humans, which leads to the next part of the book.[4]Dennis screams and shouts he will not go to bed. The mother, surprised at this sudden fear of bed, asks why. Dennis explains that he is afraid of humans. He says humans will "creep under my monster bed while I'm asleep." Dennis's mother is not convinced of her son's story and tries to persuade Dennis to fall asleep.[5]She gives Dennis his teddy bear and also says she will not turn off the light. She begins to kiss Dennis, but Dennis reacts and bites her on the nose. Dennis's mother then promises her son that the humans won't get him. She then readies him for bed. However, Dennis concludes he will sleep under his bed so the humans will not be able to find him.[5]As Dennis falls asleep, a young boy skips school and ventures into the Withering Wood to hide (presumably from his parents). He walks deep into the woods so that he comes upon Dennis's and his mother's cave. Not knowing where he is, he walks into the cave for rest. He then decides to sleep.[6]He finds Dennis's bedroom and decides to sleep on the bed. He changes into his night clothes and begins to fall asleep.[7] However, the boy was afraid of monsters. With the absence of his mother, he checks under the bed himself, and to his surprise, he finds Dennis. Both Dennis and the young boy run away.[8]The book then explains not to misbehave and how it would feel if Dennis's mother would tell the reader if humans were not real.[9]Dennis is a polite,[3] green, cave-dwelling reptilian monster that resembles a Velociraptor. As the main character of the story, he has many human-like features, such as smiling,[10] walking,[10] and emotion.[11] The monster has two objects he carries around with him, his teddy bear and pillow.[12] He is given these objects to give the reader an impression of a small child. Dennis also possesses several toys. These toys resemble the characters of another children's book, Where the Wild Things Are.[13]  Dennis also plays hopskotch near his cave.[10]Dennis has a strong fear of human children. He believes that there are humans underneath his bed, just as humans believe there are monsters underneath their beds.[5] This fear has led him into trouble with his mother (see below). He has even bitten her nose while she was about to kiss him.[14] However, in the end, Dennis chose to sleep underneath his bed so that the children could not find him underneath there.[6]Dennis's mother is a larger monster than Dennis, though obviously of the same species.[3] A caring mother, she tries to get her son, Dennis, to sleep on top of his bed and to discontinue his fear of humans.[5] However, when Dennis refuses to sleep on top of his bed, she goes through extreme difficulties to get him to sleep. She keeps the light on, she gives Dennis his teddy bear.[5]The mother is shown to be "much larger" than Dennis, the small monster.[3] The mother has many human mother-like qualities, such as her purse that she is seen carrying in the beginning of the book.[3] She tucks her child in every night,[15] and also reads stories to him about humans.[16] She also plays with Dennis as well.[16]Not much is known about the small child. On the day of Dennis's refusal to sleep, the boy had skipped school, described in the book as hooky, and had hid in the forest.[6] However, the child soon lost his way and wandered into the cave where Dennis and the monster's mother lived.[6] By the time he arrived at the cave, he was very tired of walking and decided to sleep in the cave. He eventually found Dennis's room, with the bed.[7]He took his clothes off into his pajamas and then decided to go to sleep.[7]  However, with the absence of the boy's mother and his fear of monsters underneath the bed, he decided the only way to see if there were monsters was to look under the bed himself.[8]  When he gazed under the bed, he saw Dennis. Both Dennis and the boy had the same reaction, they were afraid of each other.[9]  Thus, the boy ran out of the cave and Dennis ran to his mother. It is unknown what happened to the boy after the small incident.[17]There are a few other minor or secondary characters in The Monster Bed. These include:There are two major morals in The Monster Bed that can both give children two lessons. One is fear of the opposite race, such as monsters' fear of children[4] and children's fear of monsters.[8] The book was meant to give the impression to children that their fear was as scared of them as they were of their fear, providing comfort for the small children. It also teaches children to check under the bed themselves.[8]Another possible moral is to teach kids not to skip school, as the small child did,[6] and to not try to hide from your parents in areas you do not know.[7]The book received great reviews from parents for various reasons. Some were excited their child had begun reading,[19] and some loved the illustrations, plot, and characters.[19] Others liked it because it appealed to their children and because it had an unusual twist on children's fear of monsters.[20] The book received a 4.5 rating at Amazon.com,[19] and a 4/5 on Circle Time book reviews.[21]The Monster Bed is not unusual in its writing style and illustration style.The book was written by Jeanne Willis.[22] The style of the writing is in the format of a poem, with the first and second lines rhyming and the third and fourth rhyming, such as "He took off his pillows and blankets and said, / 'From now on, I plan to sleep under my bed. / If I'm underneath and a human comes near, / It won't think to look for me, safe under here.'"[23] There is mostly four lines per page, though some pages have six, and one page has only a single line.[24]The illustrations were created by Susan Varley using watercolor and pencil. The illustrations give the reader the impression that both Dennis and his mother are just like humans. Susan Varley even added a small easter egg to her illustrations—a closer look at Dennis's many toys everywhere in the house reveals that they are the same creatures as seen in Where the Wild Things Are.[13]Some editions of the book come with a plush toy of Dennis, the main character, with a teddy bear in one hand and his pillow in the other.  All of the toy's limbs are moveable, including the monster's ears, and it was made to be a bedtime toy. The toy follows all of the details in the book, down to the texture of Dennis's skin."
Samuel Sarfati;"Samuel Sarfati (died 1519), known as Gallo,[1] was a prominent Italian physician and leader of the Jewish community in Rome.Samuel Sarfati was the father of Joseph Sarfati (d. 1527), personal physician and medical adviser to Pope Clement VII, and a poet in Hebrew.[2]Originally from Provence, Sarfati moved to Rome in 1498. After settling in Rome, Pope Alexander VI extended privileges on him such as permission to treat Christian patients and permission to not wear the special distinguishing Jewish badge that Jews were required to wear. He was a community leader, and represented the Jewish community at the coronation of Pope Julius II in 1503.In 1504, Sarfati became the Pontifical Archiater[2] during the reign of Pope Julius II.[1][3][4] In August 1511, according to Erasmus, Sarfati successfully treated a "serious illness" of Pope Julius II,[1] which some historians theorize might have been syphilis.[5]In 1515, Sarfati became the physician of Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici."
New York State Route 130;"New York State Route 130New York State Route 130 (NY 130) is a state highway entirely within Erie County, New York, in the United States. It runs east–west from U.S. Route 62 (US 62, named Bailey Avenue) in Buffalo to the village of Depew, where it terminates at US 20 and NY 78 (Transit Road).  Throughout this course, NY 130 is named Broadway, a roadway name that continues eastward beyond Depew even after NY 130 ends.NY 130 begins at an intersection with US 62 (Bailey Avenue) in the East Side of downtown Buffalo as a touring route continuation of Broadway. NY 130 proceeds eastward through Buffalo as a four-lane commercial/industrial roadway on the south side of a railroad yard complex maintained by CSX in Schiller Park. The route bends southeast, crosses under a CSX line also used by Amtrak, soon bending east once again. During this eastern stretch, NY 130 is a residential street to the south in the town of Cheektowaga while running alongside the railroad yard. At the end of the railroad yard, NY 130 intersects with access ramps to NY 240 (Harlem Road). Running northeast through Cheektowaga, NY 130 runs along the railroad line as it proceeds eastward, crossing north of several industrial sites and south of cemeteries.[4]A short distance later, as NY 130 continues through Cheektowaga, it crosses over the New York State Thruway (I-90) just south of exit 52. Bending eastward, NY 130 enters the hamlet of Forks, where it has a two-quadrant interchange with NY 277 (Union Road). After the interchange, NY 130 bends away from the railroad tracks, running eastward as a four-lane residential/commercial street. Approaching another set of railroad tracks, the route bends northeast alongside, entering the village of Depew, where it intersects with County Route 317 (CR 317, Dick Road), which connects to the Buffalo-Depew Amtrak station. After the junction with CR 317, NY 130 bends southeast, crosses under the second set of railroad tracks and continues east through Depew as Broadway.[4]NY 130 continues east, passing a large industrial lot before turning southeast once again into a commercial district. At an intersection with CR 322 (Borden Road) and A Street, the route enters downtown Depew. Through downtown Depew, NY 130 is a four-lane residential street, passing several businesses on its way east. As the Cayuga Creek approaches the roadside, NY 130 intersects with US 20 and NY 78 (Transit Road), where NY 130 terminates and US 20 continues east along Broadway.[4]When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, Broadway in Buffalo and points east became part of NY 5, a cross-state highway extending from the Pennsylvania state line northeast of Erie, Pennsylvania, to the Massachusetts state line west of Pittsfield, Massachusetts.[5] By 1926, NY 5 had been shifted northward between Buffalo and Albany[6] to follow what had previously been NY 5A.[5] The former routing of NY 5 between the two cities became NY 7.[6] In 1927, the portion of NY 7 between Buffalo and Canawaugus (west of Avon) was renumbered again to NY 35.[7]US 20 was assigned in 1927, however, it initially bypassed downtown Buffalo on modern US 20A.[7] It was realigned c. 1938 to enter the eastern suburbs of Buffalo by way of Southwestern Boulevard and Transit Road. At Broadway, US 20 turned east onto what had been NY 35 and exited the city. The former routing of NY 35 to Niagara Square in downtown Buffalo was redesignated as NY 130.[2][3] NY 130 was truncated to US 62 on July 1, 1974.[8] The former section from Washington Street (four blocks east of Niagara Square) to US 62 is still maintained by NYSDOT as NY 954L, an unsigned reference route.[9]The entire route is in Erie County."

GAM-63 RASCAL;"The GAM-63 RASCAL was a supersonic air-to-surface missile that was developed by the Bell Aircraft Company. The RASCAL was the United States Air Force's first nuclear armed standoff missile. The RASCAL was initially designated the ASM-A-2, then re-designated the B-63 in 1951 and finally re-designated the GAM-63 in 1955. The name RASCAL was the acronym for RAdar SCAnning Link, the missile's guidance system.[1] The RASCAL project was cancelled in September 1958.During World War II, Nazi Germany air-launched 1,176 V-1 missiles from Heinkel He 111 bombers. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) studied this weapon system. Testing was conducted in the United States using B-17 bombers and the JB-2 Loon, a locally produced copy of the V-1. Successful testing of this combination led to the release of requirements to the aerospace industry for an air-to-surface missile on 15 July 1945.[2]On July 15, 1945 the USAAF published the military characteristics for an air-to-surface missile. The missile was to be launched from an aircraft at an altitude of 20,000 to 45,000 feet (6,100 to 13,700 m), must operate at a speed of at least 1,200 miles per hour (1,900 km/h) for a range of at least 100 miles (160 km). The missile be able to strike within 500 feet (150 m) of the target 75 percent of the time. Guidance could be either remotely or self-contained.[3] This resulted in MX-767 Project Mastiff, which was to develop a nuclear armed air-to-surface drone or self-controlled air-to-surface missile. Northrop Corporation, Bell, and Republic Aviation were invited by the USAAF to submit proposals for Mastiff.[4] Bell was awarded a feasibility study contract by the USAAF on 1 April 1946. Bell studied the feasibility of developing a subsonic "pilot-less" bomber carrying a substantial payload over a distance of 300 miles (480 km).[5][6] After 18 months of study, Bell concluded that rocket propulsion was not capable of providing the performance needed to boost the missile the AAF wanted to a range of 300 miles.[5] The range requirement was reduced to 100 miles (160 km) but other technical problems surfaced.[5] The Rascal caught the attention of the journal Aviation Week in 1951 when it report “First practical application of the Bell X-1 supersonic research test plans as a military aircraft may be in an air-to-ground guided missile . . . which will probably be designated Rascal.[7]As a risk reduction measure the USAAF divided the program. Project MX-776 was divided into two sub projects as a risk reduction measure, MX-776A and MX-776B.[3]: 14 The MX-776A program developed the RTV-A-4 Shrike later re-designated the X-9 as a testbed for the later Rascal that would be developed under project MX-776B. MX-776A in itself was an ambitious program intended to not only develop aerodynamic, structural, guidance and propulsion information. The X-9 was also to develop the knowledge and skills required to check out and launch an air-to-ground missile. MX-776A was also to develop experience in training crews to maintain and deploy the new weapon.[8]: 85  It was the intent of the Air Material Command that the Shrike could provide the USAF with a tactical weapon following the test program.[3]: 16  The X-9 program was successful in that all essential goals were met. The X-9 program began using two rocket thrust chamber one built by Aerojet and the other by Solar.[8]: 82   From flight of the 16th X-9 the rocket motor was a Bell XLR65-BA-1[8]: 87 The X-9 Shrike was flown with two different guidance systems. The first was a radio command guidance system manufactured by RCA’s Federal Telecommunications Division. Later in the development program guidance was provided by a preset/radar command guidance system developed by Bell.[9][10]   The X-9 program also tested on three flights a warhead which dispersed chemical bomblets.[8]: 87  The X-9 was one of the more successful of the early missile test programs resulting in the program being terminated well short of the originally intended number of flights.[8]: 86  Twenty two X-9 missiles were launched between April 1949 and January 1953.[2]The intended mission for the RASCAL was the destruction of highly defended targets on routs to strategic targets. Only targets with well defined radar returns could be attacked by RASCAL.[3]: 7 In May 1947, the USAAF awarded the Bell Aircraft Company a contract for the construction of a supersonic air-to-surface missile[2] compatible with the B-29 Superfortress, the B-36 bomber, and the B-50 Superfortress bomber. The missile was to have a range of 100 miles (160 km),[1][11][12] Bell's development effort was led by Walter R. Dornberger.[13] Rascal, was required to carry a 5,000 pound warhead a distance of 150 nautical miles at a speed of Mach 3.0 by July 1955.[3]: 17  It was intended that the Rascal would be deployed on the B-50 and B-36.[3]: 17 The RASCAL design used the X-9's canard aerodynamic configuration and a rocket engine derived from the X-9's rocket-propulsion system.[5] The RASCAL was larger than the X-9 with a fuselage that was 9 feet (2.7 m) longer and 2 feet (0.61 m) larger in diameter. The RASCAL's flight controls included forward and rear surfaces. Forward surfaces include fixed horizontal stabilizers and movable dorsal and ventral surfaces. Rear surfaces include wings with ailerons and fixed dorsal and ventral stabilizers. The aft lower stabilizer could be folded for ground handling.The RASCAL was powered by a XLR67-BA-1 rocket engine also developed by Bell. The XLR-67 provided 10,440 pounds-force (46.4 kN)[14] of thrust using three vertical in-line thrust chambers. All three thrust chambers of the XLR67 were operated during the missile's boost phase which could last up to two minutes. At the conclusion of the boost phase the upper and lower chambers of the XLR-67 were shut down and thrust was sustained by the center chamber alone.[1] Fuel for the XLR-67 included 600 US gallons (2,300 L) of white fuming nitric acid oxidizer and 293 US gallons (1,110 L) of JP-4 jet fuel.[1] The oxidizer was stored in a series of tube bundles instead of a spherical storage tank. It is believed this configuration was chosen because it weighed less than a spherical tank of the same volume.[15] Propellant was provided to the thrust chambers by a turbine driven propellant pump. A gas generator powered the propellant pump. The propellants were glow plug ignited. Bell contracted with Purdue University for the glow plug ignition system. Aerojet provided the pump drive assemblies.[15]The RASCAL guidance system was developed jointly by Bell, Federal Communications/Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and Texas Instruments.[1] The initial version of the control system provided an accuracy or circular error probable (CEP) of 3,000 feet (910 m). Adequate for a missile equipped with a nuclear weapon.The bomber carrying the missile was modified with an additional antenna and equipment at the bombardier's position needed to guide the RASCAL. During the flight to the launch point, the bombardier transferred wind and navigation data periodically to the missile. Prior to launch the bombardier tuned a video relay receiver, altitude phasing, and adjusted the terminal guidance tracking indicator. Missile control surfaces were also checked to make sure they were functional.[1]Prior to the bomber taking off, the RASCAL was pre-programmed for a given flight path. Navigation to the intended launch point 90 miles from the target was determined  by the DB-47E’s MA-8 navigation system. Before launch the MA-8 fed the aircraft’s velocity and heading to the missile. Following launch an inertial system guided the missile during launch, climb and mid-curse phases of its flight. During the terminal dive a command guidance control system was used where the RASCAL was remotely controlled by the bombardier in the launching bomber.[3]: 8   After launch, a lanyard connecting the RASCAL to the bomber was used to start the missile's rocket engine. In the event the lanyard failed an automatic timer would count down and start the engine. The RASCAL was air-launched above 40,000 feet (12,000 m).[1]Terminal guidance was by radar imaging of the target which was transmitted back to the bomber. As the missile approached the target the detail in the radar video transmitted from the missile improved. The missile began a terminal dive about 20 miles (32 km) from the target.[16] The command guidance system did not send a directional signal and was not encrypted which made it susceptible to detection and jamming.[1]The guidance system developed by Bell for the GAM-63A version of the RASCAL  produced  a CEP of 1,500 feet (460 m).[2]  The accuracy claims of the inertial guidance system have been questioned by sources.,[1][2] It was possible to drop the RASCAL as a gravity bomb if a system malfunction occurred in flight. In such case the missile would be used against would attack a less heavily defended target.[3]: 9 The RASCAL's forward section was interchangeable for different targets. Using this capability the RASCAL could be equipped with nuclear, biological, chemical, blast, or incendiary warheads.[4] The requirements for biological and chemical warheads were dropped at the end of 1953.[4] On 5 December 1949, requirements for the RASCAL called for a nuclear warhead weighing between 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg) and 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg).[4] The RASCAL warhead compartment accommodated a cylinder 3.8 feet (1.2 m) in diameter and 6.25 feet (1.91 m) in length. The USAF also wanted the ability to use the RASCAL as a standard gravity bomb if the missile could not be readied for launch.[4]In January 1950, Bell began to study what nuclear warheads were available for RASCAL. The W-5 nuclear warhead was initially considered. On 20 August 1950 the Special Weapons Development Board (SWDB) authorized a W-5/RASCAL integration effort..[17]: 119–123  The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was responsible for developing the fuzing system for the RASCAL warhead. No provision was made for surface burst at this time.[4] In April 1952 fuze development was shifted to Bell which resulted because it was USAF policy to make airframe contractors responsible for nuclear weapons fuzing since this system needed to be integrated with the missile's guidance system..[17]: 119–123  Bell developed two complete fuzing systems, airburst or surface burst.[4] Then in March 1956 the W-5/RASCAL program was canceled.[4]In July 1955, the W-27 nuclear warhead was considered as a replacement for the W-5 for the RASCAL.[18] USAF requirements for the W-27 called for a 2,800 lb (1,300 kg) nuclear warhead with either electronic countermeasures equipment, infrared countermeasures equipment, or extra fuel to increase the range of the RASCAL.[4] A design for the adaption kit between the W-27 and the RASCAL was completed in January 1957 before the RASCAL was canceled..[17]: 135–136 Three bombers were originally considered as RASCAL launch platforms. The B-29 was removed from front line service while the RASCAL was in development.[2] In March 1952, the USAF then turned to the B-36 and B-47 as RASCAL missile carriers.[5] The B-36 was assigned first priority for the RASCAL.[5] The USAF Strategic Air Command did not agree with the decision to use the B-47 to carry the RASCAL. SAC wished to substitute the B-47 with the B-50 proposing to field a single squadron each of RASCAL equipped B-50s and B-36s. It was determined that RASCAL-carrying B-50s would need to be based outside the United States because the B-50 would have less range while carrying the RASCAL.[1] The decision to eliminate the B-50 as a RASCAL carrier was not reached until June 1956.[1] A single B-50 was used as a launch platform in support of the RASCAL test program until 1955. A cradle lowered the RASCAL from the B-50's bomb bay before launch. The first powered RASCAL was launched from the test B-50 on 30 September 1952 at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico in the United States[1]In May 1953, 12 DB-36H "director-bombers" were ordered from Convair.[1] Each bomber would be equipped to carry a single RASCAL missile. The RASCAL occupied both of the B-36's aft bomb bays where it was carried semi-submerged. A portion of the missile was located inside the aircraft and a portion of the missile hung below the aircraft. One forward bomb bay was used to hold equipment required by the RASCAL's guidance system. The retractable antenna for the command guidance system was installed in the rear of the aircraft.The first YDB-36H was flown on 3 July 1953. Six captive carry flights were flown between 31 July 1953 and 16 August 1953.[1] The addition of the missile to the B-36 did not increase drag or change the handling characteristics of the bomber.[1] An un-powered RASCAL was dropped from a YDB-36H on 25 August 1953. On 21 December 1954, a DB-36H was delivered to the Air Force for use in the RASCAL test program at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, in the United States.[1] By June 1955, at least two missiles had been launched from the B-36 and Convair had completed manufacturing modification kits for the 12 planned aircraft. Two kits had been installed on B-36 aircraft when the USAF decided to carry the RASCAL only on the B-47 bomber.[1]Before the end of 1952, Boeing received a contract from the USAF to modify two B-47Bs into prototype RASCAL missile carriers. A removable missile support strut was installed on the right side of the B-47. Extra internal structure was installed to support the loads of the strut and missile. While carrying the RASCAL, the B-47 could not carry other weapons.[1] The guidance equipment for RASCAL was added to the B-47 bomb bay. The retractable antenna needed by RASCAL was added to the rear fuselage.[1] Both aircraft were sent to Holloman Air Force Base to support the RASCAL test program. After completion of the two DB-47B prototypes, the delays in the RASCAL's development effectively placed the DB-47 modification effort on hold until March 1955.[5] Then in June 1955, Boeing received a contract to modify 30 DB-47Bs to carry the RASCAL.The Strategic Air Command was concerned that externally mounting the RASCAL and the associated internal equipment needed to support the missile would seriously degrade the performance of the bomber. The performance impact was great enough to make the B-47/RASCAL combination of questionable value.[5] SAC also argued the B-47/RASCAL combination might never work well. Since the equipment being added to the B-47 to guide the missile added more complexity to the already complex B-47.[5] Then the modification costs required to carry the RASCAL added nearly US$1 million to the cost of every B-47.[5] To SAC these costs seemed premature considering the state of the RASCAL's development at that time.[5] Finally SAC considered it unwise to commit aircraft and to start training crews before the missile's development had been completed.[5]The Strategic Air Command considered the GAM-63 of no value, but Air Staff wished to press on with deployment of the RASCAL.[5] SAC actively prevented the B-52 from being used as a RASCAL carrier.[5] The USAF then decided to use the B-47E as a RASCAL missile carrier. Boeing was contracted to convert two B-47E into YDB-47E aircraft. The first YDB-47E flew in January 1954.[5] The first successful RASCAL launch from a DB-47E occurred in July 1955.[1] The mission of bombers had changed in 1956 from high altitude penetration to low level penetration so as to evade enemy radars.[5] The fact that the minimum launch altitude of the RASCAL was 35,000 feet (11,000 m) meant that a low altitude delivery was impossible[3]: 8 RASCAL test launches at White Sands Missile RangeThe actual mission profile of the Rascal was quite restrained. The mission began the moment the carrier aircraft left the ramp and took off towards a predetermined launch point and assigned target. Guidance before launch was dependent upon the DB-47E’s MA-8 navigation system which determined the course to a preplanned launch point and automatically launched the missile when the launch point was reached. The flight of the Rascal began with a 19 degree climb angle to an altitude of 65,000 feet where it then leveled off. For the first 73 Nautical miles (roughly 195 seconds) Rascal was inertially guided. When the guidance system determined the missile was 17 nautical miles from the target the autopilot put the missile into a 35-degree dive. Then the  terminal radar guidance switched on. The operator of the guidance system then had to interpret what vision the radar screen was providing him and decide to either monitor or correct the missiles course.[3]: 8–9  SAC was not interested in the Rascal because of this operational restriction as well as significantly affecting the cost and usefulness of the launch airplane.[5]In early 1956, the USAF limited DB-47E production to just two aircraft.[5] In May 1957 the USAF decided to field only one instead of two DB-47 squadrons equipped with the RASCAL missile.[5] Strategic Air Command leadership believed the RASCAL was already obsolete.[1][5] By December 1957, the USAF 445th Bomb Squadron of the USAF 321st Bomb Wing was training with the RASCAL. The first production RASCAL was accepted at Pinecastle Air Force Base on 30 October 1957.[1] Funding shortages would prevent facilities from being built at Pinecastle Air Force Base until 1959. In August 1958 a review of the previous 6 months RASCAL testing revealed that out of 65 scheduled test launches only one launch was a success. More than half of the test launches were canceled and most of the others were failures.[5]On 29 September 1958 the USAF terminated the RASCAL program.[1][5]The AGM-28 Hound Dog replaced the GAM-63 program. The first flight tests of the Hound Dog were in April 1959, and the first operational Hound Dog was delivered to the USAF in December 1959. The first Hound Dog equipped SAC squadron reached initial operational capability in July 1960. The Hound Dog offered a weapon with nearly five times the range of the RASCAL, without command guidance, and without hazardous fuels to contend with. Two Hound Dogs could be carried by a B-52 as well as it’s normal bomb load.Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and eraRelated lists"

Margëlliç Castle;"Margëlliç Castle (Albanian: Kalaja e Margëlliçit) is a castle in the village of Margëlliç near Patos, western Albania. It is a castle that dates from the 7th century AD and is found on top of a hill. The castle was part of the defence system of the ancient city of Byllis.

Belver Dam;"Belver Dam (Portuguese: Barragem de Belver) is a concrete gravity dam on the Tagus, where the river forms the border line between the Portuguese districts of Portalegre and Santarém. It is located in the municipality Gavião, in Portalegre District.Construction of the dam began in 1945. The dam was completed in 1952. It is owned by HIDROTEJO.[1]Belver Dam is a 30-metre-tall (98 ft) (height above foundation) and 327.5-metre-long (1,074 ft) gravity dam with a crest altitude of 47.5 metres (156 ft). The volume of the dam is 90,000 m³. The spillway is part of the dam body (10 roller gates with a maximum discharge capacity of 18,000 m³/s).[1]At full reservoir level of 46.15 metres (151.4 ft) (maximum flood level of 47.15 metres (154.7 ft)) the reservoir of the dam has a surface area of 2.86 km² and its total capacity is 12.5 mio. m³. The active capacity is 8.5 (7.5)[2] mio. m³. Minimum operating level is 41 metres (135 ft).[1]The run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plant went operational in 1951.[2] It is operated by EDP. The plant has a nameplate capacity of 80.7[1][2][3] (80)[4] MW. Its average annual generation is 220[2] (176,[1] 180[3] or 239[4]) GWh.The power station contains six Kaplan turbine-generators in a dam powerhouse. The machines 1 to 5 have vertical shafts, whereas machine 6 has a horizontal shaft. The maximum hydraulic head is 15.2 metres (50 ft).[2]"

Toorourrong Reservoir;"Toorourrong Reservoir is a small water supply reservoir located on the southern slopes of the Great Dividing Range approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The reservoir is formed by the Toorourrong Dam across the Plenty River, and an interbasin transfer. The dam is operated by Melbourne Water and the reservoir forms part of the Melbourne water supply system. Water from the Toorourrong Reservoir flows by aqueduct to the Yan Yean Reservoir.The reservoir is formed by an earthen embankment dam across the eastern branch of the Plenty River below the junction with Jacks Creek. The system was constructed in 1883–1885 as an extension of the Yan Yean water system. Water is diverted from Wallaby and Silver Creeks, part of the Murray–Darling basin on the northern side of the Great Dividing Range—via the open, granite-lined Wallaby Aqueduct—across the Great Dividing Range just east of Mount Disappointment, then into Jacks Creek and into the reservoir. The reservoir acts as a settling basin before the water travels 8 kilometres (5 mi) down the Clearwater Channel to Yan Yean.[1][2][3][4] The reservoir catchments are within the Wallaby Creek section of the Kinglake National Park.[5]A safety review in 2006 recommended remedial works be undertaken on the dam.[6] Grouted stone columns were installed on both the upstream and downstream sides of the dam wall in 2011.[7]The Yan Yean Reservoir, completed in 1857, was Melbourne's first water supply system. In 1879 low dam levels showed that further water sources were necessary to meet increased demand by a growing population.[8] The Wallaby Creek aqueduct was constructed in 1882–1883 to divert water via an interbasin transfer from Wallaby Creek via Jacks Creek and the Plenty River to Yan Yean.[9] The reservoir was constructed in 1883–1885 and linked to Yan Yean by the Clearwater Channel aqueduct, and the Wallaby Creek aqueduct was extended north to harvest Silver Creek.[10] Public Works Department engineer William Thwaites designed most of these works.[11] As water quality in the lower Plenty River had deteriorated, the intake from the river at Yan Yean Reservoir was closed and all water supply was drawn from the closed forest catchments via Toorourrong.[8]The reservoir and associated works are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.[3]Below the dam wall is the 12-hectare (30-acre) Toorourrong Reservoir Park. The park and surrounding forest were burned in the 2009 Victorian bushfires.[6][12] The park is now open to the public.[13]In 2011, the City of Whittlesea's Bushfires Memorial Working Group selected Toorourrong Reservoir as a site for a memorial to remember the impact of the Victorian bushfires on the local community.[12]There is a platypus-watching hide overlooking the reservoir. The Australian Platypus Conservatory was based at the reservoir from 1996 to 2007 and at that time the area supported approximately 30 platypus. The effect of the 2009 fires on the platypus is not currently known.[14]"
Sárika Góth;"Charlotte "Sárika" Góth (1900-1992) was a Hungarian-Dutch painter.[1]Góth was born on 29 March 1900 in Vienna, Austria to Hungarian parents. Over the course of her lifetime she lived in various parts of Europe including Paris, Budapest, Amsterdam, the Carpathian Mountains region, and Veere. Her teachers included her father, Móric Góth [hu], Jo Koster, André Lhote, and Jan Toorop. From 1918 through 1920 she studied at the Akademie van beeldende kunsten (Royal Academy of Art, The Hague). Góth was a member of the Arti et Amicitiae, and Zeeuwse Kunstkring.[2] Góth's work was included in the 1939 exhibition and sale Onze Kunst van Heden (Our Art of Today) at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.[3]Góth died on 1 April 1992 in Veere.[4]"
Manuel Ramil;"Manuel Ramil (born 8 March 1978 in Ares, A Coruña, Spain) is a Spanish musician, best known as the former keyboardist for the Power metal band WarCry and Torquemada and as the current keyboardist of alternative/power metal band Sauze, formed by himself, along with Alberto Ardines, Fernando Mon, and Toni Amboaje. His influences are Dream Theater, Yngwie Malmsteen, Angra, Symphony X, Kamelot, Ark, and many more.After going through several bands of unstable formation, in 1996 he formed the Heavy metal band Torquemada. A year later he recorded his first EP, Santa Inquisición.He remained in the band for almost 6 years but in September 2001 he left the band. Also collaborated with some bands like Thánatos, recording diverse Intros for their concerts, and participated with the band Trashnos in the recording of their debut album Tiempo.In all this time he extended his musical vision and began to feel specially attracted by bands like Dream Theater, Angra, Symphony X. Two months later, in December 2001, he decided to embark in a Progressive metal project called Fake Intermisión, which he still works on.In July 2002 he went to Lugones to take a test as WarCry's keyboard-player, the band in which he worked until early 2008."

Mighty Sound of the South;"The Mighty Sound of the South is the marching band that represents and performs for the University of Memphis in Memphis, TN.  The band plays at Memphis Tigers football games as a marching band and at Tigers basketball games as a pep band.At the end of the 1962-1963 basketball season, the Tiger team had the distinction of being the only southern team to be invited to play in the National Invitational Tournament in Madison Square Garden.  Thomas C. Ferguson, in only his second year as band director, was a big basketball fan, and furnished a pep band for every home game, which was not a given as it is today.  He decided that his pep band should go to New York City, and he called the tournament committee for permission.  They had to check into it, because a pep band had never before played for a basketball game in the Garden.  They were given the green light to become the first.Nineteen pep band members boarded a bus for New York City.  They were determined to make a name for themselves - literally.  Using markers and an old bed sheet, they fashioned a makeshift sign with the words "The Mighty Sound of the South" to humorously describe their modestly sized band.  The basketball team went on to an impressive showing, and the name "The Mighty Sound of the South" is still used, in a more literal sense, for the 200+ member marching band.A history of previous-thru-current directors / assistant directors of The Mighty Sound of The South is as follows:The Mighty Sound of the South is officially charged with preserving the traditions of the Memphis Tigers and for performing “Go! Tigers! Go!” the University of Memphis Tigers’ fight song.[1] The fight song was written by Tom Ferguson, former Director of Bands at Memphis State University during the 1960-1970s.This article on a marching band or pep band is a stub.

Pennsylvania Railroad class K5;"The Pennsylvania Railroad's class K5 was an experimental 4-6-2 "Pacific" type, built in 1929 to see if a larger Pacific than the standard K4s was worthwhile. Two prototypes were built, #5698 at the PRR's own Altoona Works, and #5699 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Although classified identically, the two locomotives differed in many aspects, as detailed below. They were both fitted with a much fatter boiler than the K4s, but dimensionally similar to those of the I1s 2-10-0 "Decapods". Most other dimensions were enlarged over the K4s as well, the exceptions being the 70 square feet (6.5 m2) grate area and the 80 in (2.032 m) drivers.In comparison:The K5's factor of adhesion was much worse than the K4s'. This is because the K5 was more powerful than the K4s but with little more weight on drivers (and thus adhesion). Factors of adhesion below 4 are often considered undesirable for steam locomotives, and the K5 design did prove to be rather less sure-footed because of it. For this reason, 4-8-2 "Mountain" and 4-8-4 "Northern" designs with more drivers (and thus a greater allowable weight on drivers within the same axle load limit) were generally considered preferable for locomotives as powerful as the K5.Both K5 locomotives were given a 130-P-75 tender carrying 12,475 US gal (47,220 L, 10,388 imp gal) of water and 22 short tons (20.0 t, 19.6 long tons) of coal. Surprisingly for such large locomotives built at such a late date, both were equipped for hand firing. Both were fitted with Worthington-pattern feedwater heaters, power reverse, unflanged main drivers, and both used nickel steel boiler shells. As built, both carried their bell on the smokebox front, hung below the headlight, this arrangement was common on other roads but at the time unique on the PRR.K5 #5698 was built at the PRR's Juniata Works (Juniata 4205 / 1929) in 1929, but having a works plate Altoona Works 4205 / 1929. This according to late Mr Ivan W. Saunders, Pittsburgh, Pa. A one-piece cast steel locomotive bed was used, this produced the locomotive frame, cylinders, and smokebox saddle as one giant steel casting. This casting was produced by Commonwealth Steel's Granite City, Illinois plant. This cast locomotive bed design was a successful trial, and was repeated on 1930s order for 100 M1a class 4-8-2 "Mountains", as was the Worthington feedwater heater with mixing chamber behind the stack.K5 #5698 used conventional Walschaerts valve gear and piston valves, and developed a starting tractive effort of 54,675 lbf (243.21 kN).During the New York World’s Fair of 1939-40, K5 5698 was displayed along with several other PRR locomotives at the fair.In  1941, following the fair, 5698 was modified with a smokebox extension and a different feedwater heater within.5698 was again modified by 1948 with a new (one-piece) smoke box, new cylinders with outside steam pipes, and “modern” front end.In contrast, Baldwin-built #5699 (Baldwin 60660 / 1928) used a conventional, fabricated locomotive frame, longer smokebox with the feedwater mixing chamber in front of the stack and the generator mounted on the right side (below the stack), and separate cylinder plus half-saddle castings. The innovation trialled on #5699 was its use of Caprotti valve gear, a poppet valve gear invented in Italy. The greater efficiencies of this gear gave the locomotive a higher tractive effort of 58,092 lbf (258.41 kN).Although efficient, the Caprotti gear proved less reliable than the regular Walschaerts valve gear and required more frequent, more skilled maintenance, and in 1937 it was replaced by Walschaerts gear driving regular piston valves, making the two locomotives (except for frames) functionally identical.The two locomotives were originally assigned to haul Philadelphia to Pittsburgh through trains. After the electrification reached Harrisburg, they were reassigned to the twisting Harrisburg–Baltimore route. Finally, they were reassigned to Pittsburgh–Crestline trains.Both were updated after World War 2 with the standard front-end "beauty treatment" given to most K4s locomotives: a sheet-steel drop coupler pilot, higher-mounted headlight, and turbo-generator mounted on the smokebox front for easier access. They lost their unique bell placement at this time for a location equally unique for the PRR: under the generator-service platform on the front of the smokebox.Like many experimental locomotives, the K5 was only a qualified success. Both locomotives performed well enough to be kept in service, but they did not perform so outstandingly as to persuade the PRR to build more. They proved that building a larger Pacific than the K4s was not worthwhile, the reduced factor of adhesion limited the locomotives' ability to put their greater power to full use. A larger locomotive with eight driving wheels was needed.This route was eventually taken, although in striking form with the T1 4-4-4-4 duplex locomotive, but the Great Depression and the huge cost of electrification meant that PRR steam locomotive development effectively ceased after the K5 and M1a. The electrical department became the thrust of PRR locomotive policy, and the displaced steam locomotives from electrified territory gave the PRR a surplus of locomotives, giving little incentive to develop more.The cast steel locomotive bed and Worthington feedwater heater both proved themselves, and they became a feature of most PRR steam locomotives built after the K5, and indeed those on many other railroads.Both locomotives were scrapped."
Act English;"Act English is a song created especially for the stage musical production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.[1]  It was written by Robert and Richard Sherman in 2003 as a replacement song for "Think Vulgar".  The song was first premiered at the London Palladium on March 15, 2003.  It is an expositional song.  That is, aspects of the plotline are revealed in its lyric.  In the song the vulgarian spies discuss their plans to steal the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car.[2]The concept for "Act English" was conceived by book writer Jeremy Sams and director Adrian Noble who felt that "Think Vulgar" was not moving the story along at a quick enough pace.  Although there were disagreements with regard to its necessity, the creative parties have remained friendly throughout the course of the show's long life."
Basil Jayawardene;"Basil Chandran Jayawardene (born 29 December 1963) is a former Sri Lankan-born international cricketer who represented the United Arab Emirates national team at the 1997 ICC Trophy. He was born in Sri Lanka, and played first-class cricket there for the Moors Sports Club.Jayawardene was born in Colombo.[1] An all-rounder, he made his first-class debut in May 1989, playing for the Moors Sports Club in a Lakspray Trophy game against the Moratuwa Sports Club.[2] Jayawardene's best performance in his debut season was an innings of 53 not out against the Colombo Cricket Club.[3] He made no top-flight appearances during the 1989–90 season, but the following season made several appearances for Moors, in both the three-day Saravanamuttu Trophy and the limited-overs Hatna Trophy.[2][4]While a resident of the UAE in the mid-1990s, Jayawardene began playing club cricket. After meeting the residency qualifications, he was selected in the UAE's squad for the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia, as one of several players with first-class experience in other countries.[5] At the tournament, however, he played in only one game, against Argentina, in which he did not bat and failed to take a wicket opening the bowling with Ahmed Nadeem.[6] After returning to Sri Lanka, Jayawardene took up coaching, and had several stints with local teams. In September 2010, he returned to the Middle East, having been appointed coach of the Kuwait national team. He oversaw Kuwait's promotion from 2010 World Cricket League Division Eight to 2010 Division Seven to 2011 Division Six, and was also in charge for the 2011 ACC Twenty20 Cup.[7]"

Uriel von Gemmingen;"Uriel von Gemmingen (1468 – 9 February 1514)[1] was appointed Archbishop of Mainz on 27 September 1508, a prince elector, and chancellor to Emperor Maximillian I on 23 April 1509.Uriel was one of ten children of Hans von Gemmingen (1431–1487).On 10 November 1509, he was entangled in the Pfefferkorn controversy, after Johannes Pfefferkorn seized and desired to burn Jewish books.[2] Gemmingen and the consultant Johannes Reuchlin assigned by him did not see a danger to the Christian faith in the writings used by Jews. On 10 May 1513 he appointed the Jewish physician Beyfuss the rabbi over all Jews in the Mainzer state. The argument over the book went beyond Uriel's death in 1514, not ultimately settled until 1520.He is supposed to have killed a cellar master in anger shortly before his own reputed death after catching the man stealing wine. Rumors suggested that he may have then faked his own death, and that the body buried in Mainz Cathedral was instead that of the cellar master, with Uriel afterwards fleeing to Italy where he died years later. However the tomb was reopened in 1724, where a corpse was found with the expected adornments of an archbishop, the matter is still considered unsettled."
Villa Constitución;"Villa Constitución is a city in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, and the head town of the Constitución Department. It is located on the south-western banks of the Paraná River between the courses of the Arroyo Pavón and the Arroyo del Medio, about 214 km south from the provincial capital, the city of Santa Fe, and 50 km from Rosario. It has a population of more than 47,374 inhabitants as per the 2010 census [INDEC].The initial settlement on the shore of the Paraná was called Puerto de Piedras. The town was founded by the initiative of some businessmen from nearby Rosario, after receiving authorization from the government of Santa Fe. The area was strategically important because it was adequate for a port and next to the Arroyo del Medio, which is the natural border with the Buenos Aires Province. The residents of Puerto de Piedras attended the foundation of the new town, with the presence of governor Juan Pablo López, on 14 February 1858. The name Villa Constitución was given to the town to honor the Assembly that had promulgated the Constitution of 1852.The town started to grow substantially with the arrival of the railroad in 1888–1890 (the station at the junction of the line coming from the port with the Buenos Aires–Rosario railway gave rise to the town of Empalme Villa Constitución). Villa Constitución became an important agricultural center, and then (since the mid-20th century) home for many industrial enterprises.In the early 60's, in the city had a plant of the Goliath Hansa cars. The Hansa 1100 Lexus are made in Argentina by Goliath Hansa Argentina in the city of Villa Constitución, Santa Fe for the 1960–1961 years in three versions: Sedán de Lujo, Combi y Súper cupé Lujo. With a capital of $3,350,000, began operations on May 2, 1960, and September 15 began work on the construction of a 19,000 m2 manufacturing plant.[1]In Spanish."
Ellen Weaver;"Ellen Weaver (born 1979/1980)[1] is Republican politician who is  South Carolina's Superintendent of Education-Elect of South Carolina, defeating Democrat Lisa Ellis in the general election in November 2022. She is the president and CEO of the Palmetto Promise Institute, a conservative think tank in South Carolina.Weaver graduated from Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina. She worked for Senator Jim DeMint.[2] Weaver, along with Senator DeMint, founded the Palmetto Promise Institute, a conservative think tank. Weaver serves as the president of the institution.[3] Weaver serves as a non-elected member of the Education Oversight Committee for the South Carolina General Assembly.[4] Weaver serves as the founder and chief executive officer of Palmetto Promise Institute.[5]Weaver was appointed to the South Carolina Education Oversight Committee in 2018, becoming the chair of the organization in February 2019.[6] She held the position for two years until her resignation in 2021, though she remains on the board. She succeeded Neil Robinson in 2019, who succeeded her in 2021.In 2022, Weaver declared her candidacy for South Carolina's superintendent of education, to succeed Republican Molly Spearman, who did not seek a third term. Her endorsements included Senator Tim Scott, former U.S. ambassador of the United Nations and former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley[7] former Senator Jim DeMint, and former U.S. Secretary of Education Mick Zais.[8][9] When it was discovered that Weaver does not hold a master's degree, a requirement to serve as state superintendent of education, Weaver announced she would have the degree by October 2022. She received a master's degree in Educational Leadership from the Christian affiliated Bob Jones University. The degree does not confer eligibility to attain a teaching certification.[10] Multiple media outlets have focused on her lack of a masters degree and potentially other requirements for taking office under South Carolina law.[11][12]In contrast to her runoff and general election opponents, who have received mostly small single-donor contributions, Weaver has received large contributions, including from out-of-state pro-school choice supporters. Her campaign received support in the form of $750,000 in attack ads paid for by Pennsylvania billionaire Jeff Yass' Super PAC, School Freedom Fund. The ads boosted Weaver's claims that Maness was a "liberal" by using out-of-context clips of Democrats introducing Maness at conferences.[13][14]During the primary runoff campaign, Weaver accused her challenger, Kathy Maness, of not being conservative enough to serve as an elected Republican. Weaver said, "we have a clear choice between a proven America-first conservative and my opponent, whose face could be on Wikipedia next to Republican in Name Only."[15] Maness reacted by arguing that Weaver lacked appropriate credentials to serve as superintendent of education.In the Republican primary, Kathy Maness placed first with 31% of the vote. Weaver was in second place with 23% of the vote. Because no candidate received 50% of the vote, a runoff election was held two weeks later. Weaver defeated Maness in the Republican primary runoff on June 28, 2022.[16]In the general election, she defeated Democrat Lisa Ellis. She will become the 18th South Carolina superintendent of education on January 11, 2023.[17]She has argued that the teaching of critical race theory is a major threat to South Carolina's school system, citing it as "woke Washington ideology."[18] According to the South Carolina Department of Education and school district officials, critical race theory is not systematically taught or funded in SC public schools, and has not been taught in the past.[19] But Weaver maintains that critical race theory is taught in South Carolina schools after hearing complaints from teachers and parents. In the 2022 debate for state superintendent of education, Weaver stated that she rejects the "woke ideology" of Kimberlé Crenshaw and Ibram X. Kendi.[20]During her campaign, Weaver argued that parents, not teachers, maintain the right to guide their children through mental, physical, and health-related decisions.[4] Weaver is a strong advocate of school choice and supports providing education scholarship accounts (see school voucher) to subsidize private or charter school tuition.[4][5][21] In a high-profile example of Weaver's support for public funding subsidizing private school tuition, the South Carolina Supreme Court determined that South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster's SAFE Grants, which were promoted publicly by Weaver and the Palmetto Promise Institute, were a violation of the state constitution's prohibition against state funds being used to fund private schools.[22][23]"
Modulus of convergence;"In real analysis, a branch of mathematics, a modulus of convergence is a function that tells how quickly a convergent sequence converges.  These moduli are often employed in the study of computable analysis and constructive mathematics. If a sequence of real numbers xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} converges to a real number x{\displaystyle x}, then by definition, for every real ε>0{\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} there is a natural number N{\displaystyle N} such that if i>N{\displaystyle i>N} then |x−xi|<ε{\displaystyle \left|x-x_{i}\right|<\varepsilon }. A modulus of convergence is essentially a function that, given ε{\displaystyle \varepsilon }, returns a corresponding value of N{\displaystyle N}.Suppose that xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} is a convergent sequence of real numbers with limit x{\displaystyle x}. There are two ways of defining a modulus of convergence as a function from natural numbers to natural numbers:The latter definition is often employed in constructive settings, where the limit x{\displaystyle x} may actually be identified with the convergent sequence. Some authors use an alternate definition that replaces 1/n{\displaystyle 1/n} with 2−n{\displaystyle 2^{-n}}."

Norm Augustinus;"Norman Theodoor Augustinus, Jr is an American writer.Augustinus was born in the Hutzel Women's Hospital[1] in Detroit, Michigan. He is the son of Levontina Melnyk (Melnychuk) and Norman Augustinus, Sr.  His grandfather Bart Theodoor Augustinus was born in Amsterdam, but left the Netherlands in 1922 entering the US by way of the Vermont, St. Albans Canadian Crossing.  Augustinus never met his biological father, but at the age of ten his mother remarried.  Augustinus credits his stepfather for much of his success. Augustinus's mother gave birth to twins but the other child was stillborn. Known widely for writing humor, Augustinus studied Journalism and Communications at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan where he was an editor of the university newspaper the (Ferris Torch) and writer/producer of the then popular radio show, The Adventures of E-Man.[2]  While a freshman at Ferris State University Augustinus published LEONARD. During his senior year at Ferris State University Augustinus placed in an invention contest and won a cash award for a mailbox transmitter device. A certificate and cash prize was presented to Augustinus during the dedication and open house of the Manufacturing Resource and Productivity Center.[3]An inventor, his gadgets have been featured in numerous publications and television shows.[4]Augustinus' highly viewed 'iPhone Colon Exam' invention/video was an inspiration to Patrick O'Neil the inventor of the iPhone olloclip which has sold over 75 million units worldwide.  Augustinus is cited in the olloclip US patent.[5]He has been a copywriter, run for political office[6] hunted for treasure, appeared in over three dozen television commercials, and worked toward a private pilot license.  In 1991 Augustinus developed the story-line and dialogue for place mats used in over 300 McDonald's restaurants throughout Michigan, The Adventures of Tizzie Bean.[7]  Additionally, Augustinus landed a bit part (under five lines) in the movie Hoffa starring Jack Nicholson (Shot in Cobo Hall Arena, Detroit).[8]  Augustinus is listed in the 2003 & 2004 Edition of Marquis Who's Who in America and was nominated for the Ferris State University Distinguished Alumni Award two consecutive years in a row.[9] In 1999 he was accepted into the prestigious Powerhouse Theatre Program at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York.  He has written for newspapers and online publications such as McSweeney's Internet Tendency and he is a member of the Society of Professional Journalists, Screen Actor's Guild/American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG - AFTRA) and Actors' Equity (AEA).In March 2013 Roll Call and a dozen other publications worldwide, published a story about an animated cartoon Augustinus created and posted on his website with regards to the Obama administration.[10]  The cartoon depicted several high ranking members of the Obama administration being laser beamed into nonexistence by a drone. The cartoon prompted a visit from the United States Secret Service. Highly controversial, the cartoon was viewed over 11 million times, and made Augustinus the first cartoonist in the United States to be investigated by a government agency because of a cartoon.In 2014 and 2015 Augustinus stood in Columbus Circle Manhattan for hundreds of hours holding large, creatively worded banners in support of the New York City horse carriage industry, which de Blasio vowed to end immediately upon being elected NYC mayor.[11] Augustinus was thanked by the Teamsters for his support in a full page notice/ad published in the New York Daily News on January 1, 2016.[12]Augustinus is one of the earliest podcasters.  In 1992 he broadcast his offbeat stories and poems (via the internet) using large uncompressed wav (wave) files.  In 1995 Augustinus began using RealAudio due largely to the dramatic increase in speed, eventually shifting his focus to the mp3 format and Podcasting in late 2004.  During 2006 comical bits produced by Augustinus were broadcast weekly on Sirius Satellite Radio.His stepfather was a seasoned storyteller and involved with the Tool & Die industry in Detroit and (as a boy) Augustinus often accompanied him when calling on clients.  According to Augustinus, it was during these times that he "learned how to tell a story."In 2012 his sister Sandra committed suicide after being diagnosed with bone cancer after being treated for breast cancer.  Augustinus writes daily and performs his popular stand-up comedy routine regularly.  His novel, 'Cats and Dogs' (ISBN 9780615596907) was an Amazon Humor Best Seller (#8), in February 2013. His novel 'Bedbadger' (ISBN 9780615759753) was released January 21, 2013 and was also featured on the Amazon Humor Best Seller list.On August 26, 2015 while driving through Michigan, Augustinus saw a Jeep Cherokee lose control and roll over several times off I-75. Augustinus ran to the car and pulled two children from the smoking, overturned vehicle.[13] On October 9, 2015, Augustinus was nominated for the prestigious Carnegie Medal."
Pro-independence movements in the Russian Civil War;"Pro-independence movements in the Russian Civil War within the territory of the former Russian Empire sought the creation of independent and non-Bolshevik nation states after the October Revolution. They were often supported politically or militarily by the Entente Powers. Some of them co-operated with the Russian White movement, but others fought it. Many pro-independence movements emerged after the fall of the Russian Empire and fought in the Russian Civil War.[1]The following list presents some of the pro-independence movements and the conflicts they were involved in during this period."

Mel Casas;"Melesio "Mel" Casas (November 24, 1929 – November 30, 2014) was a Chicano artist, activist, writer and teacher. He used visual statements, his sense of humor and love of puns to "address cultural stereotypes."[1][2] His work has been collected by the San Antonio Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum,[3] and nationally and internationally.[4] He is best known for his series of 150 large-scale paintings called "Humanscapes" that were painted between 1965 and 1989.[5][6] Casas was also well known as a writer and theorist.[4] His "Brown Paper Report" is considered an important document of Chicano history.[7] In his writing, he emphasized the importance of "self-determination" and equality for Chicanos/as.[8] He is considered to be one of the important founders of the Chicano Arts movement.[9] Casas felt that once artists had a fair chance to exhibit in the United States, then they would become part of "Americana."[10]Casas was born in  El Paso, Texas[1] to Mexican parents during the Great Depression.[10] He grew up and lived in El Segundo Barrio.[11] His father liked to draw and this influenced Casas to start drawing on his own.[10] As a young man decided that he wanted to be an artist.[10] Casas felt that he had a good education in elementary school and junior high.[10] He attended El Paso High School which he chose in order to get a better education.[10] At the time, there were more Anglo students at El Paso High and Casas felt alienated from the other students because of his background and heavy Mexican accent.[10] It was Casas' first encounter with discrimination.[10] He graduated from high school in 1948.[2] After graduating high school, Casas worked for Pacific Fruit Express, a railroad company, as an iceman.[10] He also helped with his father's Swedish massage business located in downtown El Paso.[10]Later, Casas was called into the United States Army[12] and his father insisted it was his duty to serve.[10] Casas served in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, where he was injured and subsequently returned to the United States.[12] Casas was awarded a Purple Heart for bravery in the war.[4]Casas went to college using the G.I. Bill.[10] First, he started to study psychology, due to practical considerations, but later changed to art and teaching.[10] In college, he had a very strong background in classical art theory, drawing and painting.[10] He received a BA in 1956 from Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso).[13] Casas then received a MFA from the University of the Americas in Mexico City in 1958.[12][13]Casas received an all-level certificate to teach in Texas.[10] He was considered by his students to be a "generous" teacher, helping to launch many young art careers.[9] Casas taught art at Jefferson High School in El Paso, Texas[14] for about three years.[10] One of his students was Gaspar Enriquez.[14]Casas served as president of the Con Safo art group in the early 1970s. Con Safo is a Pachuco slang expression whose most common meanings are: "the same to you," "don't mess with this," and "forbidden to touch."[15] In its abbreviated form, C/S, it is used to protect murals from defacement. The art group adopted the name "Con Safo" on December 19, 1971, at which time Casas presented his "Brown Paper Report," which listed 22 definitions for the term Con Safo.[15] Felipe Reyes, a painter, was the prime mover of the Con Safo group, which he views as a final reorganization of a group he cofounded in 1968, which was initially known as El Grupo.[15] In December 1971 the Con Safo group consisted of Felipe Reyes, Jose Esquivel, Jesse Almazán, Roberto Ríos, and Jose Garza (all of whom were members of El Grupo), and Mel Casas and Jesse Treviño.[15] Other notable artists who subsequently joined the group include Rudy Treviño (who later served as president) César Martínez, Amado Peña, Carmen Lomas Garza, Santos Martínez, Kathy Vargas, Roberto Gonzalez, and Rolando Briseño. Several of these artists were students of Casas, who was teaching at San Antonio College. Through the Con Safo group, members gained exposure by participating in exhibitions for which they were paid a fee by the exhibiting institutions.[10] Con Safo was considered influential and helped Chicano art receive recognition when Chicanos and their work were largely excluded from museums and galleries.[16]Casas taught for 29 years at San Antonio College[1] where he was Chair of the Art Department for 12 years.[12] Casas felt that he had the opportunity to teach a "very good cross-section of the city" which was something he enjoyed.[10] Being the chair of the department, however, was stressful for Casas, since he was often on call.[10] He retired in 1990.[2] After retiring, Casas and his wife Grace went to Italy, spending two years in Brandisi and two in Sicily.[10]Casas had a two-year battle with cancer.[1] He died in his home with his family and his wife of 35 years, Grace Casas.[2] He and Grace had one child, Bruce. With his first wife, Maria, Mel had four children: Alfredo, Ingrid, Mike and Sonya.[4]Casas was first recognized for his work in the abstract expressionist style[2] which was considered "typical" for his time period in the United States.[17] Casas recalls that eventually he felt that the abstract work was too "pretty" and it wasn't the right artistic language for him.[10] After the mid 1960s he began to do more representational work.[2] He was very interested in dealing with the objectification of women in media[2] and "debunking" racial stereotypes.[18]Though Casas is best known for a handful of works that treat Chicano themes, he created an unusually wide array of works with varied themes and styles. He used clever word play mixed with imagery.[2] He challenged stereotypes, especially in some of the works in his "Humanscape" series.I so divide the picture plane of my painting so as to force the spectator into the role of 'voyeur,' thus acquiring an identity through participation.—Mel Casas as quoted in Quirarte, Jacinto, Mexican American artists. Austin: University of Texas, 1973. p. 83[19]The 153 paintings that make up the "Humanscape" series were inspired by a "glimpse of a drive-in movie screen."[6] Cordova, who curated four Humanscape exhibitions with approximately half of the paintings,[20] divides the Humanscapes into five groups.[6] In the first group, from 1965 through 1967, Casas made depictions of audiences watching films at drive-in cinemas and conventional movie theaters. The blurry, nebulous audience members were gradually endowed with more color and form, and from late 1967 through 1970, many Humanscape paintings dealt with the Sexual Revolution. Casas began making politically themed paintings in 1968, and he emphasized this subject matter from 1970 through 1975. From 1975 through 1981, Casas' favorite topic as art about art. Finally, from 1982 through 1989, the last Humanscapes treated what Casas called the "Southwestern clichés." In this series, Casas focuses on imagery from popular culture and how these media images can and do affect viewers[17] who Casas called voyeurs, instead.[21] "Humanscapes" addresses various issues, such as Chicano politics and identity by using biting humor, pop culture and folk art.[22] His incorporation of imagery from Mexican and Pre-Columbian iconography in conjunction with pop art was unique.[22] His choice of subject matter, which satirized racism and may show sexualized nudes, was often considered to be "provocative."[23] Casas felt that media, like television, movies and advertising had the power to change people and could be used to change them for the better.[21] His paintings often reacted to these media types by using erotic themes to highlight the effect that media had on the viewer.[21] The "Humanscapes" were generally painted on large-scale canvases, mimicking the drive-in movies that inspired them.[21] The text chosen for many of the "Humanscapes" help create visual "conundrums" that are meant to allow the viewer to question and re-interpret the ideas that are juxtaposed with the imagery.[11] Earlier "Humanscapes" had limited palette choices, but later paintings had more colors and were rather vibrant.[21] As Casas' paintings became more colorful, they also began to have a richer sense of satire and visual play.[21]Casas often paid a price for his trenchant social criticism. He was designated "Artist of the Year" by the San Antonio Art League for 1968, only to have this honor revoked  three days later.[6] Casas, who referred to the dominant notion of beauty as the Barbie doll ideal, spoke of the privileges of blond hair and blue eyes while he undressed a Barbie doll during his acceptance speech.[6]As a fellow artist, he was good at asking critical questions of the work of others and encouraging them to submit their work to exhibitions and competitions.[24]In later years, he ceased exhibiting, but painted almost daily, even when he was battling cancer.[19]To me, being an outsider is the next thing to being an artist. I think we are lucky to be born outsiders. The other thing, however, is this. You think that, because you eat tortillas and you think in Spanish or in the Mexican tradition, you can identify yourself. I don't think it's quite true. First of all, because we use liquitex, and we use canvas, and we use stretcher boards. 'No usamos bastidores o manta.' So we are a mixture. So there is no sense in trying to say that we have that kind of purity. We are entirely different. We are neither Mexican nor Anglos. We are in between.[21]Chicano Art is not Art for Art's Sake, but Art for Human Sake.[25]I don't think we should break away from our tradition. We cannot deny it. It will tend to flavor, to color the way we think. I think linguistically and iconographically we will tend to mix the two. I have to my benefit that I can combine English and Spanish to give a more colorful expression than I would if I said it all in English or all in Spanish. The subtlety of the meanings, the syntax, or the pronunciation of the words give it something that is missing.[21]Cordova, Ruben C. (2009).

Uroš;"Uroš (Serbian Cyrillic: Урош) is a South Slavic given or last name primarily spread amongst Serbs, and Slovenians (mostly of Serbian descent). This noun has been interpreted as "lords", because it usually appears in conjunction with velmõžie (велмѫжие) "magnates", as in the phrase велмѫжие и ѹрове "magnates and lords". The noun was probably borrowed from the Hungarian word úr, "master" or "lord". The suffix -oš in uroš is found in a number of Slavic given or last names, particularly those of the Croats, Serbs, Czechs, and Poles.[1][2]The name may refer to:"

Davis and Elkins Historic District;"The Davis and Elkins Historic District is a National Historic Landmark District on the campus of Davis & Elkins College in Elkins, West Virginia.  It includes two mansions, the Senator Stephen Benton Elkins House (Halliehurst) and Graceland, that are separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  A gate house and an ice house are also included in the district.  These four structures are associated with the families of Henry Gassaway Davis (1823-1916) and Stephen Benton Elkins (1841-1911), who were dominating figures in the politics and economy of West Virginia in the late 19th century.  It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998.[2][3]The Davis and Elkins Historic District is composed of four discontiguous sections of the Davis & Elkins College campus on the north side of Elkins.  Each area contains a single structure, associated historically the life of either Henry Davis or Stephen Benton Elkins.  Davis was a self-made businessman who made his fortune mainly in the railroad business, and then embarked on a series of highly successful coal ventures with Elkins, his son-in-law.  Both Elkins and Davis served as United States Senators, and were significant figures in both state and national politics in the post-Civil War years of the 19th century.[3]Graceland, completed in 1893 for Davis, is a large and sophisticated expression of Queen Anne Victorian architecture, designed by Baldwin and Pennington of Baltimore, Maryland.  It is a mainly stone structure, with architectural variety typical of the Queen Anne, and a more Colonial Revival porch across the front.  It was the centerpiece of a 360-acre (150 ha) estate, and is prominently sited on one of the highest points of the Davis & Elkins campus.[3]  It now serves as an inn and conference center for the college.Halliehurst, completed in 1890 for Elkins, was designed by Charles T. Mott of New York City.  It is also a large and elaborate Queen Anne Victorian, its exterior finished mainly in wooden clapboards and stone.  Its interior is particularly elaborate, with a large main hall and dining room.  Halliehurst was given by Hallie Elkins (the widow of Stephen Elkins) to the college, which has used it in a variety of ways since.[3]The icehouse is a cylindrical stone structure, built for the Elkinses to house ice used for refrigeration.[3]  It has typically been used by the college as a coffeehouse and gathering place for students.The gatehouse is located at the northeast corner of Campus Drive and Sycamore Street.  Built for the Elkinses at the same time as Halliehurst, it is stylistically similar to the main house, although on a smaller scale.  It was the longtime home of the estate's groundskeepers, a role that continued into the college years.[3]"

Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre;"The Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (Royal NLR, Dutch: Koninklijk Nederlands Lucht- en Ruimtevaartcentrum), formerly known as the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR, Dutch: Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaartlaboratorium) is an aerospace research organization of the Netherlands and is one of its major technological institutes. These institutes perform a large part of the applied research in the Netherlands, each within its own specific field of technology. As an independent non-profit organization, the NLR is the aerospace-knowledge enterprise in the Netherlands and provides technical support to the aerospace sector.[1]NLR performs research and develops technology in the field of aviation and space travel. Work under research contracts (national and international, government and industry) amounts to 75 percent of NLR's activities, the remaining 25 percent is funded by the Dutch government for basic demand-oriented research programs and development of research equipment. Depending on the project, NLR acts as a sole contractor or as a subcontractor cooperating with other institutes or partners from the industry.The RSL, the predecessor of NLR, was officially founded on 5 April 1919, shortly after the First World War, however,  Aeronautics had developed slowly in the Netherlands during the first two decades of this century when compared to the neighboring countries. After the Armistice, 11 November 1918, the aeronautical community started to concentrate on the application of the newly obtained skills and experience. The Government appointed a committee to review the possibilities of aerial applications. The year 1919 saw many new initiatives. On Saturday, April 5, 1919, the new Laboratory of the RSL was officially opened in the Navy Yard in Amsterdam. However, at this official opening, there was already a laboratory in operation. In his opening speech, Prof. L.A. Van Royen emphasized that the RSL should develop free and open communications with the aeronautical world and in turn, the RSL should be assisted to come into contact with those who are interested in the activities of RSL.  The RSL was originated at offices belonging to the Ministry of Defense, mainly as a result of the aviation activities of the Army (since 1913) and the Navy (since 1917). The groundwork for the foundation of RSL started during World War I in 1917, when civil aviation in the Netherlands was non-existent. On  January 1, 1920, the RSL was transferred from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of Public Works, because, after the war, the defense spending was cut drastically and civil aviation appeared in the horizon. As early as 1922, the Minister of Public Works proposed to terminate RSL. The main argument was that the annual funding was considered extravagant. Fortunately nothing happened immediately and the dispute continued for many years. In 1918, when the RSL was planned, the location at the Navy Yard in Amsterdam was meant to be a temporary site only. Prof. Van Royen intended to establish a permanent laboratory in Delft, in close association with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). However, flight testing had become an important part of the activities and several people felt that a location close to Schiphol and Fokker was more important than being close to TU Delft. The RSL continued to operate until it was converted in the independent Foundation NLL in 1937. The only major change in its formal task took place when a separate Department of Civil Aviation (RLD) was created to supervise airworthiness and aircraft operations in the Netherlands. However, this did not have much effect on the technical content of the work of the RSL, it was a separation of responsibilities. The centerpiece of the laboratory was an Eiffel type wind tunnel. There were, however, complications with the construction of the Eiffel-type, though they were overcome by the time of the official opening of the building.This tunnel was used extensively for a period of 20 years for a variety of aeronautical and non-aeronautical tests and, apart from smaller research facilities which were built at TU Delft, it was the only wind tunnel available for aeronautical development in the Netherlands until 1940.In the meantime, Wolff and Koning carried out studies for new wind tunnel facilities. As a result, two closed type wind tunnels were built in the new laboratory at Sloterweg in Amsterdam, that became fully operational in 1940. One was the LST 3 x 2 m2 which was large enough to simulate powered aircraft flight and a smaller tunnel, the LST 1.5 x 1.5 m2  for research purposes and non-aeronautical wind tunnel testing. They were the main low speed aerodynamics facilities for over 40 years until the DNW (the joint venture with the German sister organization DLR) became operational in 1980, followed by the LST 3 x 2.25 m2 of NLR, both in the Noordoostpolder.During the Second World War, the total contract work-load of the laboratory hugely decreased, although it is important to note that the total personnel employed increased about 40%.[2]  When the Allied Forces entered the Netherlands in September 1944, the situation shifted dramatically. The food and fuel supply, which was already nearly depleted, practically stopped. It took several months after the Liberation Day on May 5, 1945, for the normal operations of the laboratory to resume. Although the laboratory did not incur physical damage during the war, it had fallen into disrepair. On top of that, until 1952 there was an unfavorable political opinion of NLL, especially in terms of financial support for the expansion plans of the NLL that included a HST, among other facilities.The year 1950 marked the beginning of international co-operation and cross utilization of facilities between NLL and ONERA. On  February 23, 1955, a contract between AICMA-CIPS and NLL was signed, stipulating that NLL would make available the HST to members of AICMA for up to 50% of the available testing time. Later, in 1976, a two-nation aeronautical test facility, the DNW of Germany and the Netherlands, became a reality. In 1988, a four-nation (France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands) aeronautical test facility, the ETW, was opened. In 1957, after a period of deliberations and negotiations, an area of 2 square kilometers was purchased in the Noordoostpolder (NOP), and in 1958, the first NLR employees started working there. Since then there has been a gradual shift of activities from Amsterdam to the NOP.On April 5, 2019, the Netherlands Aerospace Center celebrated their 100th anniversary. It is on this day that they received the honorary title 'Royal'.[3]More than 600 people are employed across two sites, one located in Amsterdam, and the other in Marknesse (about 100 km north-east of Amsterdam). Over two-thirds of the staff are graduates from universities or technical colleges, with a large variety in specialized professions such as aerospace engineers, psychologists, mathematicians and physicists.At its two sites NLR owns several sophisticated aerospace research facilities, including different wind tunnels, such as the Low Speed Wind tunnel, the Transonic and the Supersonic Wind Tunnel. Exploitation of these wind tunnels and the wind tunnels of DLR have been entrusted to the foundation German-Dutch wind tunnels (DNW), which also includes a large facility in the Noordoostpolder in which Germany and the Netherlands have a share of 50%.NLR has a laboratory airplane, a Cessna Citation II (PH-LAB), it is shared with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).NLR has developed different flight simulators for research on aircraft and helicopters.NLR conducts research on future concepts in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) using its advanced proprietary simulation platform, the NLR ATC Research Simulator (NARSIM). NARSIM consists of two physical manifestations, one for en-route ATC (NARSIM-Radar) and one for airport tower controllers (NARSIM-Tower) with a 360-degrees field-of-view visual system. NARSIM is also used for performance of technology verification and validation activities as well as air traffic controller training.NLR has installations in which airplane constructions on full scale, components and test samples can be tested. Equipment and software for development of construction of parts for airplanes and space vehicles are also available. For development and construction of composites a special laboratory has been arranged. Moreover, the NLR has instrumentation for flight tests, and several specialized apparatus for development of avionics. Facilities for testing antenna and conduction of so-called environmental tests are used to test several equipment. In the micromechanics workplace the NLR develops models and instruments for wind tunnel tests. The computer network of the NLR contains a supercomputer for the implementation of extensive aerodynamic and structural calculations.AICMA = Association Internationale des Constructeurs de Matérial Aéronautique (European Association of Aircraft Manufacturers)CIPS = Comité Internationale Permanent des Souffleries (Permanent Committee on Wind Tunnels)DLR = Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center)DNW = Deutsch-Niederländischer Windkanal / Duits-Nederlandse Windtunnel (German-Dutch Wind Tunnel)ETW = European Transonic Wind TunnelHST = High Speed Wind TunnelLST = Low Speed Wind TunnelMRO = Maintenance, Repair and OverhaulNLL = Nationaal Luchtvaartlaboratorium (National Aeronautical Laboratory)ONERA = Office National d’Études et de R'echerches Aéronautiques (French Aeronautical Research Organization)RLD = Rijksluchtvaartdienst (Government Department of Civil Aviation)RSL = Rijks-Studiedienst voor de Luchtvaart (Government Service for Aeronautical Studies)Coordinates: 52°20′41.20″N 4°50′39.11″E﻿ / ﻿52.3447778°N 4.8441972°E﻿ / 52.3447778, 4.8441972"

Brantford Blast;"Brantford Blast are a Canadian senior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey Association's Allan Cup Hockey, from Brantford, Ontario. The team was established in 2000, and play their games at the Brantford Civic Centre.The Blast were the winners of the 2008 Allan Cup as Canadian Senior "AAA" Champions.In 2000, the Ontario Hockey Association allowed for the expansion of the first Brantford team since 1987 into Ontario's top tier of Senior hockey. The Brantford Prowl competed during the 2000-01 Southwestern Senior A Hockey League season and finished in fifth place with a record of 12 wins, 17 losses, and a tie.  The team took 2001-02 off, but then re-emerged in 2002 as the Blast.In 2002, Brantford rejoined the top tier of Ontario senior hockey this time known as the Brantford Blast. At the time, the city had the Brantford Golden Eagles in the Ontario Hockey Association, but had also lost teams, like the Brantford Alexanders of the Ontario Hockey League, who left in 1984 and the Brantford Smoke of the Colonial Hockey League, who left in 1998. The Blast would play their home games at the Brantford Civic Centre as well. The Blast have made it to the post season twice. In the 2005–06 season, when they won the league, but lost in the first round to the Dundas Real McCoys 4 games to 2. In the 2006–07 season, they placed third, defeating the Petrolia Squires 4 games to 3, and the Windsor St. Clair Saints 4 games to none to capture their first MLH Championship after a 4–3 win Monday March 12 in front of the home town crowd in Brantford.Brantford won the J. Ross Robertson Cup for the league's playoffs championship in 2013 and 2014.[1]The Blast finished the 2007–08 season in second place.  They swept the Windsor St. Clair Saints 4-games-to-none in the Major League Hockey semi-final, but were defeated 4-games-to-2 to the Dundas Real McCoys.The Brantford Blast were the host team of the 2008 Allan Cup, which was held in Brantford from April 14-April 19, 2008. This was also the 100th anniversary for the event, one of the reasons that the Blast wanted to host it.The Brantford Blast became the first Ontario Hockey Association team since the Brantford Motts Clamatos, in 1987, to win the Allan Cup.  As hosts of the 2008 Allan Cup, the Blast failed to win their league and were allowed to bypass the OHA Final against the Whitby Dunlops and the Renwick Cup against the Thunder Bay Hawks.  After almost a months rest, the Blast competed at home for the Allan Cup and won the entire thing.  After suffering their only loss of the tournament to the Shawinigan Xtreme 3–2 in the first game, the Blast defeated the Bentley Generals 5–3 to clinch second in their division.  They defeated the Robertson Cup and EOSHL champion Whitby Dunlops in the quarter-final handily, 7–2.  They then knocked off the Major League Hockey and Renwick Cup champion Dundas Real McCoys in the semi-final 3–2 in overtime.  They met Bentley again in the final, who defeated the 2007 champions Lloydminster Border Kings and the Shawinigan Xtreme, and defeated them 3–1 to win the Canadian National Senior "AAA" crown.Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against"
Only the Brave (2006 film);"Only the Brave is a 2006 independent film about the 100th Infantry Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated World War II fighting unit primarily made up of "Nisei" Japanese Americans, which for its size and length of service became the most decorated unit in U.S. military history. The film, produced and directed by Lane Nishikawa is a fictionalized account of the rescue of the Lost Battalion.In 1953, Jimmy Takata (Nishikawa) suffers from "battle fatigue" (posttraumatic stress disorder), to the great concern of his wife, Mary (Tomita). Raised in Hawaii, Takata and some of his friends enlisted in the 100th Battalion, serving in the European Theater of Operations. In a series of flashbacks, he remembers the war and events in his life surrounding it. Following a head injury, he begins to have visions, and believes that he is seeing memories of other men, including his friend Freddy Watada (Watanabe) as he courted Mary (who would later be Jimmy's wife) before entering the Army. Freddy receives a "million-dollar wound" (one which is serious enough to require evacuation to the United States, but not permanently disabling), and he shows Takata an engagement ring, purchased before being sent to Europe, which he intends to give Mary upon his return.Takata's concern about the visions is dismissed as disorientation caused by the head wound by "Doc" Naganuma, the unit medic, a Medical Doctor who had likewise joined to help his friends. Takata also has a vision of his father, a Buddhist priest in Federal custody, and who tells him "You must accept your fate, here"—pointing to his head -- "the rest of you will follow, here," pointing to Takata's heart. Takata later learns that his father has died, 49 days earlier. Buddhists believe that a spirit will enter Heaven or be reborn 49 days after death.When his unit is ordered to break through German lines and rescue the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment, Takata is ordered by the doctor to stay in the rear area, due to his head wound. However, as the casualties mount, he defies orders and attempts to find a way through to the trapped men. He is joined by several of his men (including Freddy), who are also unwilling to wait in the rear as their friends face the danger. Asked by a newly transferred soldier if he's ever afraid, Takata confides that his fear is of losing more men.Joining the rest of the Nisei, Takata and his men fight the Germans, as one-by-one Takata watches his men—nearly all of his friends—being killed in battle. Freddy throws his body on a grenade which had been thrown at Takata, and the men look into each other's eyes as it explodes.The battle won, Takata accepts the thanks of the lieutenant commanding the rescued unit, and notes that 211 of the 275 had been saved, at a cost of over 800 casualties.His thoughts return to 1953, where Mary's love and tears finally break through, and he is able to shed his own tears. A vision comes of his lost men and father, standing in the field hospital, and his father repeats his earlier encouraging statement.Now Takata's vision comes of meeting with Mary after the war, and meeting Mary and Freddy's young daughter, Joanie. Joanie touches the scar on his temple, and as she smiles and looks into his eyes, he is reminded of a refugee girl that he had rescued in the battle which had resulted in the head wound. Takata gives Mary the engagement ring, and explains that, since Freddy had given his life to save Takata's, the least he could do is to bring it home for her. He comforts her as she cries.As that vision fades, we see Jimmy placing the keepsakes from each of his friends in a suitcase and closing it. Mary, sitting behind the wheel of a car, looks up and asks (hoping beyond hope) if he is okay. He looks at her, is able to smile, and says that he is."
Gambia–India relations;"The Gambia–India relations refers to the international relations that exist between The Gambia and India. The Gambia maintains a High Commission in New Delhi.[1] The Embassy of India in Dakar, Senegal is concurrently accredited to The Gambia, the only Anglophone country accredited to that mission. India also maintains an Honorary Consulate General in Banjul.[2]Relations between The Gambia and India were very limited until 1985, consisting only of a confirmation of their common non-aligned principles, and common position on decolonisation and North-South issues. Prior to 1985, The Gambia maintained limited diplomatic ties with Asian countries, primarily focusing on countries such as Taiwan, China, South Korea and North Korea, from which it sought aid in exchange for political support.[3]The Gambia co-sponsored a resolution moved by India at the UN General Assembly in January 2015, to declare 21 June as International Yoga Day.[4]Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi visited The Gambia in September 2015 as the Prime Minister's Special Envoy and officially invited the country to participate in the third India Africa Forum Summit (IAFS). Gambian Vice President Isatou Njie-Saidy led the country's delegation to participate in the IAFS in New Delhi on 26–29 October 2015.[5] Addressing the IAFS delegates, Njie-Saidy described India as a "genuine friend" and "brotherly country", and described its contribution to sustainable development in Gambia and Africa as "remarkable". She praised the bilateral co-operation between the two countries calling it "a flourishing partnership that remained a strong strategic mutual benefit to both sides". Njie-Saidy stated, "The Gambia and India have common interest in international affairs and sometimes share common points of view on international issues. The level of cooperation between Gambia and India at the international scene is very much encouraging especially at the level of the United Nations." She added that The Gambia continues to "enjoy immense support and assistance" from the Indian government, and that India's intervention in Africa had led to national development and improvements in the lives of the African people.[6] Njie-Saidy also held closed door bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Hyderabad House on 30 October.[7]Gambian Health and Social Welfare minister Omar Sey visited India in November 2015 and participated in the 2015 India-Africa Business forum. Addressing the forum, Sey stated that Indian "multinational pharmaceuticals and biotechnological companies have for decades revolutionized healthcare accessibility and affordability in Africa".[8]India is The Gambia's third largest trading partner, after China and Senegal. India is the second largest destination for The Gambia's exports, and fourth largest source of its imports.[9] Bilateral trade between The Gambia and India totaled US$90.90 million in 2015–16, declining by 17.08% from the previous fiscal year. India exported $59.54 million worth of goods to The Gambia, and imported $31.35 million. The main commodities exported by India to The Gambia are cotton yarn, fabrics and made-ups, cosmetics, toiletries, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and semi-finished iron and steel products. The major commodities imported by India from The Gambia are raw cashew and cotton.[5]Gambian Minister of Trade and Industry Addoulie Jobe led a 3-member delegation to participate in 4th India-Africa Trade Ministers’ Meeting in New Delhi on 23 October 2015.[5] The Embassy of India in Dakar, in partnership with The Gambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), organized an India-Gambia Business Forum themed “Doing Business with India” in Banjul on 14 October 2016.[10]India provides The Gambia with unilateral duty-free tariff preferential (DFTP) market access for export of select goods.[5]The Pan-African e-Network project was implemented in The Gambia by Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL). An Indian NGO completed a solar electrification project in the Gambian villages of  Kankurang and Kafenkeng in September 2007.[5]India provided The Gambia with two concessionary lines of credit worth $6.7 million for a tractor assembly plant project and $10 million for the construction of the National Assembly Building complex. India approved a total amount of $16.88 million as credit for completion of National Assembly.[5] The new National Assembly was officially inaugurated by Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, who also announced that he would seek funding from India to expand the Banjul port.[11] Two lines of credit of $22.5 million each were extended in July 2014 for two projects in the Greater Banjul Area – an electricity project, and the replacement of asbestos water pipes with UPVC pipes.[5][12]India provided a line of credit worth $92 million in April 2015 for the expansion of Banjul port,[5][13] and $10 million to the Gambia Rural Electrification Extension Project.[5] The Banjul port increased its berth space for ships, added a container terminal, acquired cargo handling equipment and completed computerization.[11] Two Indian surgeons from BLK Hospital visited Banjul in September 2016 to assist in the development of healthcare delivery. Indian firm Shapoorji Pallonji Mideast was awarded a contract in October 2016 to construct the University of the Gambia (UTG) Faraba campus in Banjul at a cost of $53.46 million. India provided a grant of $500,000 to The Gambia to procure medical and educational equipment.[5]The National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) of India agreed to establish a Vocational Training Centre in The Gambia to provide skill training in fields such as plumbing, welding, electrical work, the construction industry, carpentry, draftsman-ship, survey, plastic technology, ICT, agro and food processing, and gemstones cutting and polishing.[5]Citizens of The Gambia are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.[14] Gambians often visit India to seek medical treatment. Fourteen-year old Gambian youth footballer Bubacarr Chatty received treatment for tuberculosis at the Pericardiatecony Hospital in Delhi in July 2011. Upon his return to The Gambia, he was welcomed by Vice President and Minister of Women Affairs Isatou Njie-Saidy, who praised the generosity of the Indian people. Gambia Football Association Secretary General Jammeh E.K. Bojang stated, "We can’t give words to express our happiness to the Gambian government and the Indian people for saving the life of a footballer who has the talent to be like Samuel Eto'o and Didier Drogba in the near future."[15]As of December 2016, around 600 Indian citizens reside in The Gambia. They are primarily involved in trading and private businesses including the construction sector.[5]"

Nicky Stevens;"Nicky Stevens (born Helen Maria Thomas in Carmarthen, Wales, 3 December 1949)[1][2] is a singer, famous as a member of pop group Brotherhood of Man. She is the only Welsh person to have won the Eurovision Song Contest.Nicky Stevens began singing at an early age. At the age of four she was singing in a chapel in Carmarthen, and following lessons eventually joined the Hywel Girls Choir. She also studied classical music as a singer and pianist.[3] At the age of 16 she held a residency in Swansea's Townsman nightclub.[2] During this period she also took on a job as a telephone operator. This lasted for nine months and is the only job she has ever had outside the entertainment business.[4] She later toured the Continent as a singer, performing in night clubs. Following this she went on to tour South Africa as well as clubs around the UK.[5] She also appeared on stage as a support act for the likes of Neil Sedaka, Norman Wisdom and Little and Large in the early 1970s.[1] Stevens worked mainly performing popular songs and found it a struggle at first to adapt her vocals from her classical roots.In 1972, while working as a session singer and trying to secure a record deal as a solo artist, Stevens came to the attention of Tony Hiller, who was looking to recruit new members for his group Brotherhood of Man.[1] Hiller was manager and songwriter for the group, but they had recently disbanded and keen to keep the name alive, which was still in demand for television work, he recruited Stevens alongside Martin Lee and Lee Sheriden. In 1973, signed to Deram Records, they released their first single, "Happy Ever After".Later in the year another female singer was added to the group, Sandra Stevens and as a four-piece, Brotherhood of Man went on to enjoy great success around the world. Scoring their first hit in 1974 and first No.1 the year after, the group entered and won the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Save Your Kisses for Me".[6][7][8] To date, she is the only Welsh person to win Eurovision. For the next three years, the group regularly hit the chart and scored two more No.1 singles in the UK, "Angelo" and "Figaro".[9][10]In addition to singing, Stevens is a pianist, and performed the piano accompaniment to an otherwise a cappella recording of "Send in the Clowns" in 1978, which was featured on the band's Twenty Greatest album.In 1984, while the group was on a two-year break, Stevens joined The Vernons Girls and performed with them at live shows.[1] She also did much recording work at this time on jingles and demos for songwriters. In 1988, Stevens recorded some songs with Dutch singer Albert West. In the early 1990s she also recorded some songs with British rock band Aslan[note 1] as the lead singer.Stevens still performs with Brotherhood of Man today in its original line-up, taking in UK tours and television appearances throughout Europe.[11] In November 2013, Stevens was the subject of a documentary Time of Your Life on ITV Wales talking about her career and early life growing up in a musical environment in Carmarthen.[12]During the Coronavirus pandemic, Stevens worked in a nursing home in Ferndown, where she offered music therapy, ran arts & crafts sessions and spent one-to-one time with individual residents. Upon her departure,  residents and staff gathered to perform their own version of "Save Your Kisses for Me", with amended lyrics to thank her for her time there.[13]Nicky Stevens was the second child of Ossie and Blodwen Thomas. Her father had been a musician and was killed in a road accident in 1974.[1]In June 1976 Stevens, who lived in Watford at the time married the group's guitarist, Alan Johnson at the Watford Registry Office.[14] They divorced at the end of the 1980s.[1][15] In May 1993, she got married again to an American man, fourteen years her junior called Brett. Within a year however, they had separated and then divorced.[1]In the 1990s, Stevens lived in Sturminster Marshall, but as of 2011 lives in Corfe Mullen, both in Dorset.[3] Since moving to Dorset, Stevens has begun appearing in Christmas pantomimes including Cinderella at Weymouth Pavilion in 2013 and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves at the Tivoli, Wimborne in 2014.[16][17]"

Allucio of Campugliano;"Allucio of Campugliano (or Allucio da Pescia) (1070–1134) was a Tuscan holy man who distinguished himself by his work on behalf of pilgrims and the poor, and for peace. In the Roman Catholic Church his feast day is celebrated on 23 October.Born in Valdinievole near Pescia to a well-to-do rural landowner, he spent his youth shepherding the family's flock before devoting his life to acts of charity. He built two churches, a bridge over the Arno, three hospices for pilgrims and other travellers, including one on his own property at Campigliano near Uzzano. He was a generous almsgiver. Later in his life he mediated between the Tuscan city-states, seeking to prevent conflicts that in later centuries would grow into open and continual war. He died at Valdinievole.When Allucio's relics were being translated in 1344, a vita (biography) was discovered stored in the reliquary. According to the record of the proceedings organized by the clergy of Pescia, the work was "a legend about the life and what was said about the miracles of the holy Allucius written in one document" (legendam de vita et quibusdam miraculis dicti sancti Allucii in cartula pecuria scriptam). It was thought to be from the twelfth or thirteenth century."
Wayne Barrett (kickboxer);"Wayne Barrett (born 1986) is an American kickboxer who competes in the cruiserweight division. A tall and rangy fighter, Barrett came to prominence as an amateur when he became a WKA national champion and turned professional in 2013. He signed with Glory after just one pro fight.Wayne Barrett began training in karate at ten years old before transitioning to Muay Thai and compiling a record of 19–1 with 15 knockouts as an amateur. He also successfully competed as an amateur boxer, winning a Golden Gloves title in his native Georgia and then relocating to New York City to train under Rob Rogan at Square Circe Muay Thai in Manhattan, Jason Strout for Striking at Church Street Boxing and Kelly Richardson at the Renzo Gracie Fight Academy in Brooklyn.[1] Notable sparring partners of his include Douglas Lima, Jarrell Miller, James Besselman, Costas Philippou, Brian Stann, Gian Villante, David Branch and Eddie Walker.[2][3]He defeated Simon Camaj by unanimous decision to claim the WKA Amateur United States Cruiserweight (-86 kg/189 lb) Muay Thai Championship on April 29, 2011[4][5] and had his last match in the amateur ranks on December 7, 2012, taking a unanimous decision over Quinton O'Brien.[6]Barrett made his professional debut on February 22, 2013, at Take-On Muay Thai XIX, winning by technical knockout after forcing twelve fight pro Strahinja Ivanović to retire in round two.[7]Following this, Barrett signed with Glory as a competitor in the kickboxing organization's -85 kg/187 lb middleweight division. In his promotional debut against the previously undefeated Mike Lemaire at Glory 9: New York in New York City on June 22, 2013, it took him less than 2 rounds to establish his dominance in the ring as he scored an early standing eight count. In the second round, Barrett dropped Lemaire with a knee before stopping him with a left hook followed by a right cross that sent him crashing to the canvas face first.[8][9][10]In the reserve match for the Glory 10: Los Angeles - Middleweight World Championship Tournament in Ontario, California on September 28, 2013, Barrett delivered another impressive performance as he knocked out the overmatched Robby Plotkin in the first round after flooring him earlier.[11][12][13]Taking a large step up in competition in just his fourth fight, he was matched with the Glory Middleweight Tournament Champion Joe Schilling in the main event of Glory 12: New York in New York City on November 23, 2013. Barrett struck first in the second round when he knocked Schilling down twice. The first knockdown came from a right overhand early in the round and the second from a right hook as the round ended. In the third, Schilling was able to gain some ground back when he connected with a knee that dropped Barrett, but he was able to beat the count. The fight went to the judges and Barrett was awarded a unanimous decision victory.[14][15][16]It was announced during the Glory 15: Istanbul broadcast that Barrett would be one of eight fighters competing in the Glory 17: Los Angeles - Last Man Standing middleweight tournament in Inglewood, California on June 21, 2014.[17][18] He drew Bogdan Stoica in the quarter-finals and won via third-round knockout when he countered one of the Romanian's signature flying knees with a vicious left hook. In the semis, he met Joe Schilling in a rematch but was unable to replicate his prior success against the Ohio native as he lost a split decision.[19][20][21]Legend:   Win   Loss   Draw/No contest   Notes "

Sebacoyl chloride;"Sebacoyl chloride (or sebacoyl dichloride) is a di-acyl chloride, with formula (CH2)8(COCl)2.  A colorless oily liquid with a pungent odor, it is soluble in hydrocarbons and ethers. Sebacoyl chloride is corrosive, like all acyl chlorides, it hydrolyzes, evolving hydrogen chloride. It is less susceptible to hydrolysis though than shorter chain aliphatic acyl chlorides.[1]Sebacoyl chloride can be prepared by reacting sebacic acid with an excess of thionyl chloride. Residual thionyl chloride can be removed by distillation.[2]Sebacoyl chloride can be polymerized with hexamethylenediamine yielding nylon-6,10.[3]"
Praephilotes anthracias;"Praephilotes anthracias is a species of butterfly in the family Lycaenidae first described by Hugo Theodor Christoph in 1877.[1] It is known from Kazakhstan (desert tracts of Atyrau Region, southern Altai, near Lake Zaysan, south of the Ili River valley, Baygakum), Uzbekistan (valley of the river Syr Darya), Turkmenistan (Krasnovodsk, Ashgabat, Small Balkhan), Tajikistan (Vakhsh valley, Kafirnigan), western China. The most northern locality is known from Lake Elton neighborhoods. Also known from the south of Russia - Astrakhan region, where the species was first discovered only in 1999. Now there are several populations of sandy massifs Bolhuny and Batpaysagyr. In the western part of the desert Batpaysagyr species occurs in many localities: Dosanga, Aksaraiskaya, Komsomolsk, etc. can be usually in habitats.[2]This Polyommatini-related article is a stub.

Meath on 16 September 1799.They had no son but four daughters:"
Haemophilia in European royalty;"Haemophilia figured prominently in the history of European royalty in the 19th and 20th centuries. Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, through two of her five daughters – Princess Alice and Princess Beatrice – passed the mutation to various royal houses across the continent, including the royal families of Spain, Germany, and Russia. Victoria's youngest son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, also had the disease, though none of her three elder sons did. Tests on the remains of the Romanov imperial family show that the specific form of haemophilia passed down by Queen Victoria was probably the relatively rare haemophilia B.[1] The presence of haemophilia B within the European royal families was well-known, with the condition once popularly known as "the royal disease".The sex-linked X chromosome bleeding disorder manifests almost exclusively in males, even though the genetic mutation causing the disorder is located on the X chromosome and can be inherited from the mother by male children or from either mother or father by female children. This is because the trait is recessive, meaning that only one correctly functioning copy of the blood clotting factor gene is necessary for normal clotting. Females have two X chromosomes, and hence redundant copies of the blood clotting factor gene located on them. A female who inherits a mutated copy on one X chromosome has also inherited a second X chromosome from the other parent that is likely to carry a non-mutated copy of the gene, capable of directing appropriate clotting. Such a female, with normal clotting but possessing a single mutated copy of the gene, is called a carrier. Males possess only a single X chromosome, inherited from their mother, having received a Y chromosome from their father instead of a second X. If their sole X chromosome contains the haemophilia mutation they possess no second copy to provide for normal function, as in carrier females. Each child of a carrier will have a 50% chance of inheriting their mother's mutation, of being a haemophiliac (sons) or carrier (daughters). The daughter of a male haemophiliac will always inherit his mutation, while a son cannot ever inherit it. A female will be affected with haemophilia only in the rare circumstance that she inherits mutated X chromosomes from both a haemophiliac father and a carrier or a haemophiliac mother. No case of such double inheritance is known among Queen Victoria's descendants.Although an individual's haemophilia can usually be traced in the ancestry, in about 30% of cases there is no family history of the disorder, and the condition is speculated to be the result of spontaneous mutation in an ancestor.[2]  Victoria's appears to have been a spontaneous or de novo mutation, most likely inherited from one of her parents, and she is usually considered the source of the disease in modern cases of haemophilia among her descendants. Queen Victoria's father, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, was not a haemophiliac, but the mutation may have arisen as a germline mutation within him. The rate of spontaneous mutation is known to increase with paternal age (and is higher in fathers than in mothers at all ages), Victoria's father was 51 at her birth. The probability of her mother having had a lover with haemophilia is minuscule given the low life expectancy of early 19th-century haemophiliacs. Her mother, Victoria, Duchess of Kent, was not known to have a family history of the disease, although it is possible that she was a carrier, but among her children only Victoria received the mutated copy.Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, apparently escaped the haemophilia gene, as it did not appear in any of her matrilineal descendants. Victoria's fifth child, Princess Helena, may or may not have been a carrier, two healthy sons survived to adulthood, but two other sons died in infancy, and her two daughters did not have issue. Victoria's sixth child, Princess Louise, died without issue. Queen Victoria's sons Edward VII, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn were not haemophiliacs, however, her daughters Alice and Beatrice were confirmed carriers of the gene, and Victoria's son Leopold had haemophilia, making his daughter Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone a carrier as well.Alice (1843–1878), Victoria's third child, and wife of the future Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse and by Rhine (1837–1892),  passed it on to at least three of her children: Irene, Friedrich, and Alix.Leopold (1853–1884), Victoria's eighth child, was the first member of the family to manifest haemophilia, he died at age 30 from bleeding after a minor fall,[5] only two years after marrying Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1861–1922).He passed the gene on to his only daughter, as all of the daughters of a haemophiliac father would inherit the gene:Alice's younger son Prince Maurice of Teck died in infancy, so it is not known if he was a carrier of the gene. Her daughter Lady May Abel Smith (1906–1994), Leopold's granddaughter, has living descendants none of whom has been known to have or to transmit haemophilia.Leopold's posthumous son, Charles Edward (1884–1954), was unaffected, as a father cannot pass the gene to a son.Beatrice (1857–1944), Victoria's ninth and last child, and wife of Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858–1896) passed it on to at least two, if not three, of her four children: No living member of the present or past reigning dynasties of Europe is known to have symptoms of haemophilia or is believed to carry the gene for it. The last descendant of Victoria known to have the disease was Infante Gonzalo, born in 1914, although hundreds of descendants of Queen Victoria's (including males descended only through females) have been born since 1914. However, because the haemophilia gene usually remains hidden in females who only inherit the gene from one parent, and female descendants of Victoria have left many descendants in royal and noble families, there remains a small chance that the disease could appear again, especially among the female-line Spanish descendants of Princess Beatrice.Queen Victoria died in 1901 and outlived her youngest son and a grandson, both of whom had the disease. The gene can be passed down the female line without a haemophiliac son being born, but as the family line continues and no haemophiliac sons are born, it becomes less likely that a certain ancestor had the gene and passed it on through the female line.Because the last known descendant of Queen Victoria with haemophilia died in the 1940s, the exact type of haemophilia found in this family remained unknown until 2009. Using genetic analysis of the remains of the assassinated Romanov dynasty, and specifically Tsarevich Alexei, Rogaev et al. were able to determine that the "Royal Disease" is actually haemophilia B. Specifically, they found a single-nucleotide change in the gene for clotting Factor IX that causes incorrect RNA splicing and produces a truncated, nonfunctional protein.[6]"
Day for Night (festival);"Day for Night was an art and music festival in Houston, Texas that "explores the deep connections between light, technology, sound and space".[1]  Producer Omar Afra co-conceived the idea of a festival experience that would reintroduce visual art back into the musical experience on a large scale when Kiffer Keegan pitched the idea of including new media installations during preparations for Free Press Summer Festival 2014.[2]Omar Afra and Work-Order partners Kiffer Keegan and Keira Alexandra conceptualized the idea for the unique event while working together on Free Press Summer Fest 2014. Their ideas for incorporating visual art with music didn't fit into the model of their already-existing annual music festival, Free Press Summer Fest. Borrowing from their past experience, they began work on Day for Night in the summer of 2015 and chose Alex Czetwertynski to be the [Visual Arts] Curator.[2]Day for Night showcased musicians and visual artists. The production layout varied each year depending on the venue. On average, there were 3-4 stages with musicians performing in tandem, and visual art displays throughout the venue. The lineup for musicians featured artists with a heavy emphasis on stage presence and performance regardless of notoriety or genre.[2]The festival took place in the six block area surrounding Silver Street Studios on December 19 through December 20, 2015.[3] The event featured three stages for musical acts, the red stage featured the big-name acts, the green stage was for electronic or atmospheric acts, and the blue stage for the local or obscure acts. The art installations were set up in between the stages and throughout the venue. [Consequence of Sound][4]The festival took place at the Barbara Jordan Post office in downtown Houston on December 18–19.[5]The festival took place at the Barbara Jordan Post office in downtown Houston on December 15–17.[6]After allegations of sexual misconduct with two women by festival founder Omar Afra emerged in August, 2018, the festival cut ties with Afra and foreclosed on the festival-owning entity, removing him from any involvement or ownership. An open records request from Houston Police Department summarized the incident by stating "No injuries, No evidence, No arrest." Afra denied the allegations and called them "patently false."[9][10]On November 26, 2018, an auction was held for Afra's ownership stake, due to an unfulfilled loan agreement. The ownership stake was sold to FPH Chicken Holdings, who were owed the debt. They intend to pursue additional legal action for the remaining $670,000 owed.[11] FPH Chicken Holdings is now the sole owner of the entity that owns both Free Press Summer Fest and Day for Night. Afra additionally cut ties with Free Press Houston.[12]  The festival did not take place in 2018 and it is unclear if it will be held again."
Jenny Rowan;"Jennifer Daphne Rowan QSO JP (formerly Simpson, born October 1949)[1] is a New Zealand former politician. She served as mayor of Kapiti Coast from 2007 to 2013, and was the first openly lesbian mayor in the country.Rowan was mayor of Inglewood District from 1986 until the 1989 local government reforms. She was then elected to the Taranaki Regional Council and served as deputy chair until 1991. She was a commissioner of the Environment Court of New Zealand from 1991 to 2007, and served as deputy chair of the Paekākāriki Community Board from 2004 to 2006.[2][3][4]Rowan was elected mayor of Kapiti Coast in 2007, defeating six opponents including former mayor Iride McCloy.[4][5] Major issues of her mayoralty included council spending, the Kapiti Expressway, sea level rise, and water metering.[1] These issues led to her failing to be re-elected in 2013, placing third behind Ross Church and K Gurunathan.[6][7]In 1995, Rowan and her partner Juliet "Jools" Joslin were one of three lesbian couples who unsuccessfully applied for marriage licences. In January 1996, they took part in a commitment ceremony in Wellington.[4][8] They took their case to the High Court in Quilter v Attorney-General in May, but the court ruled against them and the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling in December 1997.[9] On 30 November 1998, they sued New Zealand before the United Nations Human Rights Committee. The committee rejected the case on 17 July 2002.[10] In 2006, they flew to Canada to be legally married.[11] On 17 April 2013, they were in the public gallery to witness the passing of the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013, which legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand.[12]Rowan was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order, for public services, in the 1990 New Year Honours.[4][13] She was also awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.[14]"

Municipal services;"Municipal services or city services refer to basic services that residents of a city expect to the city government to provide in exchange for the taxes which citizens pay. Basic city services may include sanitation (both sewer and refuse), water, streets, the public library, schools, food inspection, fire department, police, ambulance, and other health department issues and transportation. City governments often operate or contract for additional utilities like electricity, gas and cable television.  Mumbai even provides a lighthouse service.The available municipal services for any individual municipality will depend on location, history, geography, statutes and tradition. Provided services may vary from country to country or even within a country. Services may be run directly by a department of the municipality or be sub-contracted to a third party.Funding for the services provided varies with the municipality in question. Funding can include tax revenue (property tax, income tax, municipal sales tax), fees (such as building permits), Grants from other Governments, fines such as speeding or parking violations, usage fees for optional services, or other sources such as profits from municipally owned or operated utilities.Probably the greatest influence is the country in which the municipality is located.In the UK, a combination of local taxation based on property value and central government grants is the main means of funding core services. This is supplemented by nominal fees for services provided (e.g. leisure facilities). For some services, a competitive fee is charged compared to commercial concerns that which allows a profit to be made. For other services, full commercial rates may be charged with municipally owned utilities or commercial property, for example. For the most part, services will be part subsidized by the municipality or fully subsidized by the municipality.In recent years, UK councils have been given some leeway in finding alternative funding which can be the simple sponsorship of flower baskets to the trading of surplus buildings and land for services from private firms. In certain notorious cases, local councils have used council funds to speculate on the money markets.Municipalities in other countries may have other methods of funding (e.g. local income taxes or even from the profits of utilities or industrial concerns fully owned by the municipality).In the United Kingdom, until their abolishment, Municipal Corporations were powerful organizations. In their Victorian heyday, with the growth of urbanization and industrialization, they could be responsible for the promotion, organization, funding, building and management of everything from housing to water supplies, power in the form of both gas and electricity, to the introduction of electric trams, almost any activity that the city fathers thoughtwas necessary to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their municipality.However, special powers needed to be granted through Local Acts in Parliament (for example, the Manchester Corporation Waterworks Act needed for the construction of Manchester's reservoirs). As times changed, the Municipal Corporations continued to try to advance the cause of their municipalities. For example, in the 1930s aviation was the new technological frontier and municipalities worked to promote themselves with the development of municipal airports.For the most part, UK municipalities lost their in-house utilities to the nationalisation and centralisation of public utilities. One notable exception is Kingston upon Hull, which still has a municipally-owned telephone company known as Kingston Communications.One trend in the UK, (in the name of efficiency) has been the privatisation of departments, the transfer of staff and assets to the new organisation and the contracting with the new organization for services to the council. This model has been used for services from road cleaning to social housing, to leisure facilities, though no council yet seems to dare to do so for more high-profile services such as schools and social services.In the UK, fire and police services are not under direct municipal control, even when a force can be closely identified with a specific municipal area such as Greater London. However, fire and police services are in part paid for by a surcharge to local taxation, and although they have no say in operational matters, local government appoints members to a committee to oversee the running of each force.Where there is a substantial industrial urban population isolated from other conurbations, or when and where the growth in demand is so great that it becomes uneconomic or impractical for commercial organisations to provide, the municipalities concerned may assume functions necessary for the growth and functioning of the city.This was the case in Victorian England also today in Mumbai, for example, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport are the major municipal organizations which are needed to allow the city to function. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is a legacy of Los Angeles, which found itself in a similar position of rapid growth at the beginning of the last century. The similarly isolated Johannesburg has chosen to run its services as standalone and self-funding, corporate entities."

Canada at the Olympics;"Canada has sent athletes to every Winter Olympic Games and almost every Summer Olympic Games since its debut at the 1900 games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, which it boycotted. Canada has won at least one medal at every Olympics in which it has competed.  The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) is the National Olympic Committee for Canada.At the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was hosted in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the country won more gold medals than any other competing nation for the first time.Canada has hosted the Olympic games three times: the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.Stakeholders from Vancouver and a group from Québec City have both expressed interest in their respective cities hosting the 2030 Winter Olympics.[1][2]  Host countryCanada also won 1 gold medal and 1 silver medal at the 1906 Summer Olympics, which the IOC no longer recognizes as an official Olympic games, so those medals are not counted in this table.*One of Canada's Ice Hockey gold medals was won during the 1920 Summer Olympics. This table does not include this medal, resulting in the discrepancy between the medals by games and medals by sports tables.Canada has never won an Olympic medal in the following current summer sports or disciplines: Archery, Badminton, Baseball, 3-on-3 basketball, BMX freestyle, BMX racing, Canoeing and kayaking (slalom), Fencing, Field hockey, Greco-Roman Wrestling, Handball, Indoor Volleyball, Karate, Modern pentathlon, Skateboarding, Sport climbing, Surfing, Table tennis, and Water polo.*One of Canada's ice hockey gold medals was won during the 1920 Summer Olympics.

He became the second Canadian to defend their Olympic gold, and first man.[6][7][8]Trampoline gymnast Rosie MacLennan was the first Canadian to defend their gold medal in an individual sport at the Summer Olympics. She won gold at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, the inaugural Olympian to defend their title in that discipline.[9]After captaining the women's ice hockey team to gold at the 2014 Winter Olympics, Caroline Ouellette became the first Winter Olympian of any country or gender to enter four or more career events and win gold in each.[10] Oullette had previously won gold in ice hockey in 2002, 2006, and 2010.Jennifer Jones skipped the Canadian women's team at the 2014 Winter Olympics to a gold medal. She is the first ever female skip in Olympic history to be undefeated throughout the tournament. Jones, Kaitlyn Lawes, Jill Officer, Dawn McEwen and spare Kirsten Wall  went unbeaten with an 11-0 record defeating  China, Sweden (round-robin and finals), Great Britain (round-robin and semi-finals), Denmark, Switzerland, Japan, Russia, the United States, and Korea.[11][12]During the 2016 Summer Olympics, swimmer Penny Oleksiak became the inaugural Canadian of either gender to win four medals at a single Summer Games and the distinction of the country's youngest Olympic multiple medalist at the age of 16: a gold in the 100 m freestyle, a silver in the 100 m butterfly, and two bronzes in the women's freestyle relays (4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m).[13] She shares the distinction if being the co-inaugural Olympic medalist born in the 21st century when, in women's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay a few days earlier, won the bronze medal with teammate Taylor Ruck.[14]After capturing gold in 2010 Winter Olympics, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir became the inaugural ice dancers from North America to win an Olympic gold medal, ending the 34-year streak of the Europeans. They were the inaugural ice dance team to win the Olympic gold at home ice and the inaugural ice dancers to win gold at their Olympic debut. They are the youngest pair to win an Olympic title at 20 and 22 respectively. They would win two more silver medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics and two more gold medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics, giving them the distinction of being the most decorated figure skaters at the Winter Games.Broadcaster Richard Garneau covered 23 Olympic Games, more than any other journalist in the world, starting with Rome in 1960 to London in 2012, missing only the Atlanta and Nagano Games. The International Olympic Committee awarded him posthumously the Pierre de Coubertin medal in recognition of his exceptional service to the Olympic movement.[15]"
Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument;"Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument is a U.S. National Monument located approximately 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico, near Cochiti Pueblo. Managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), it was established as a U.S. National Monument by President Bill Clinton in January 2001. Kasha-Katuwe means "white cliffs" in the Pueblo language Keresan.[2] The monument is a unit of the BLM's National Conservation Lands.Kasha-Katuwe is located on the Pajarito Plateau between 5700 and 6400 feet (1737–1951 m) above sea level. The area owes its remarkable geology to layers of volcanic rock and ash deposited by pyroclastic flow from eruptions within the volcanic field of the Jemez Mountains that occurred 6 to 7 million years ago. These rock layers are assigned to the Peralta Tuff. Many of the layers are light in color, which is the origin of the monument's Keresan name. Over time, weathering and erosion of these layers has created slot canyons and tent rocks. The tent rocks are composed of soft pumice and tuff. Most of the tent rocks have a distinctly conical shape and some retain their caprocks of harder stone. The tent rocks vary in height from a few feet to 90 feet (27 m).[2]The BLM maintains hiking trails as well as parking and restrooms at the site. The Slot Canyon trail is a one-way trail covering 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through a slot canyon and up a climb of 630 feet (190 m) to a lookout point where the tent rocks may be viewed from above. The Cave Loop trail is approximately 1.2 miles (1.9 km) and leads past the base of the cliffs, near some of the tent rocks and a small cavate similar to those found at the nearby Bandelier National Monument. The Veterans' Memorial Scenic Overlook, dedicated in 2004, includes a 1 mile (1.6 km) loop trail and views of Peralta Canyon and the Jemez Mountains. The overlook is located at the end of a gravel road approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) west of the tent rocks and may not be accessible depending on road and weather conditions.The monument is open for day use only and may be closed by order of the Cochiti Pueblo Tribal Governor. Considerations for hiking include the possibility of flash flooding in the slot canyons and the high altitude of the monument. The monument is closed to dogs.[2]The science fiction television series Earth 2 filmed scenes at the monument.Closeup of several of the largest hoodoos in the formation.Evidence of erosion in the slot canyonA narrow section of the slot canyonTent rocks, with Cochiti Pueblo lands and the Rio Grande in the distanceRuins of a Native American cliff dwelling"

Cofinality;"In mathematics, especially in order theory, the cofinality cf(A) of a partially ordered set A is the least of the cardinalities of the cofinal subsets of A.This definition of cofinality relies on the axiom of choice, as it uses the fact that every non-empty set of cardinal numbers has a least member. The cofinality of a partially ordered set A can alternatively be defined as the least ordinal x such that there is a function from x to A with cofinal image. This second definition makes sense without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice is assumed, as will be the case in the rest of this article, then the two definitions are equivalent.Cofinality can be similarly defined for a directed set and is used to generalize the notion of a subsequence in a net.If A admits a totally ordered cofinal subset, then we can find a subset B that is well-ordered and cofinal in A. Any subset of B is also well-ordered. Two cofinal subsets of B with minimal cardinality (i.e. their cardinality is the cofinality of B) need not be order isomorphic (for example if B=ω+ω{\displaystyle B=\omega +\omega }, then both ω+ω{\displaystyle \omega +\omega } and {ω+n:n<ω}{\displaystyle \{\omega +n:n<\omega \}} viewed as subsets of B have the countable cardinality of the cofinality of B but are not order isomorphic.)  But cofinal subsets of B with minimal order type will be order isomorphic.The cofinality of an ordinal α is the smallest ordinal δ that is the order type of a cofinal subset of α.  The cofinality of a set of ordinals or any other well-ordered set is the cofinality of the order type of that set.Thus for a limit ordinal α, there exists a δ-indexed strictly increasing sequence with limit α.  For example, the cofinality of ω² is ω, because the sequence ω·m (where m ranges over the natural numbers) tends to ω², but, more generally, any countable limit ordinal has cofinality ω.  An uncountable limit ordinal may have either cofinality ω as does ωω or an uncountable cofinality.The cofinality of 0 is 0. The cofinality of any successor ordinal is 1.  The cofinality of any nonzero limit ordinal is an infinite regular cardinal.A regular ordinal is an ordinal that is equal to its cofinality. A singular ordinal is any ordinal that is not regular.Every regular ordinal is the initial ordinal of a cardinal.  Any limit of regular ordinals is a limit of initial ordinals and thus is also initial but need not be regular. Assuming the axiom of choice, ωα+1{\displaystyle \omega _{\alpha +1}} is regular for each α.  In this case, the ordinals 0, 1, ω{\displaystyle \omega }, ω1{\displaystyle \omega _{1}}, and ω2{\displaystyle \omega _{2}} are regular, whereas 2, 3, ωω{\displaystyle \omega _{\omega }}, and ωω·2 are initial ordinals that are not regular.The cofinality of any ordinal α is a regular ordinal, i.e. the cofinality of the cofinality of α is the same as the cofinality of α.  So the cofinality operation is idempotent.If κ is an infinite cardinal number, then cf(κ) is the least cardinal such that there is an unbounded function from cf(κ) to κ, cf(κ) is also the cardinality of the smallest set of strictly smaller cardinals whose sum is κ, more preciselyThat the set above is nonempty comes from the fact thati.e. the disjoint union of κ singleton sets. This implies immediately that cf(κ) ≤ κ.The cofinality of any totally ordered set is regular, so one has cf(κ) = cf(cf(κ)).Using König's theorem, one can prove κ < κcf(κ) and κ < cf(2κ) for any infinite cardinal κ.The last inequality implies that the cofinality of the cardinality of the continuum must be uncountable. On the other hand,the ordinal number ω being the first infinite ordinal, so that the cofinality of ℵω{\displaystyle \aleph _{\omega }} is card(ω) = ℵ0{\displaystyle \aleph _{0}}.  (In particular, ℵω{\displaystyle \aleph _{\omega }} is singular.) Therefore,(Compare to the continuum hypothesis, which states 2ℵ0=ℵ1{\displaystyle 2^{\aleph _{0}}=\aleph _{1}}.)Generalizing this argument, one can prove that for a limit ordinal δOn the other hand, if the axiom of choice holds, then for a successor or zero ordinal δ"
Lake Uluabat;"Lake Uluabat (Turkish: Uluabat Gölü and Apolyont Gölü) is the name of a freshwater lake in the vicinity of Bursa, Turkey. It is a large lake, covering an area of between 135 and 160 km2 depending on the water level, but very shallow, being only 3 m deep at its deepest point. The lake contains eight islands and one other that is sometimes an island and sometimes a peninsula. The largest island is known as Halilbey Island. In the southwest the lake is fed by the Mustafakemalpaşa River, which has formed a silty delta. Water leaves the lake by way of the Ulubat stream, flowing to the west, and reaches the Sea of Marmara via the Susurluk River.[2]Most shores of the lake are covered in submerged plants, and it has the most extensive white water lily beds in Turkey. Uluabat Lake is one of the breeding areas for the endangered pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus). The latest DHKD (Society for the Protection of Nature Turkey) survey in June 1998 found 823 pygmy cormorant pairs, 105 night heron pairs, 109 squacco heron pairs, and 48 spoonbill pairs breeding on Uluabat.The alternative name Lake Apolyont comes from the lake's greek classical name Apolloniatis (Απολλωνιάτις), from Apollonia-on-the-Rhyndacum (modern Gölyazı), an ancient Greek city situated on its banks which had considerable importance since it was on major trade routes.Modern residential areas by its shores are Mustafakemalpaşa (formerly Kirmasti) and Karacabey (formerly Mikalick). The area was famous for centuries for its silkworm cultivation, but this industry has died out due to synthetic fabrics. The main industry today is fishing.Uluabat Lake was recognized by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance.[3][4] The Global Nature Fund designated the lake as a "Living Lake" in 1998.[3][4]Lake Uluabat empties into the Sea of Marmara  via the Susurluk River. The Lake is fed by the  Mustafakemalpaşa River.[2]Lake Uluabat is a large, long, shallow inland lake that is surrounded by marshes and agricultural land.[5] There are submerged plants on the shores of the lake. According to the Global Nature Fund, there is nowhere in Turkey with more white water lily beds than Lake Uluabat.[3]There are seven islands in the lake, including Halilbey Island.[2]—which is the largest island, and St. Constantine—known for the Byzantine era monastery. Today St. Constantine island is uninhabited, but the monastery has survived the Ottoman conquest of Asia Minor. The orthodox monastery has received attention from scholars because of its inscribed cross type with apses east and west.[6]One of the most well-known features of Lake Uluabat is the small island village of Gölyazı—an ancient Greek settlement near modern day Bursa.[4] Gölyazı was featured in the final episode of the Turkish TV series Kara Para Aşk.[4][7] The Gölyazı Old Mosque, located on the peninsula is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.[8]The lake, which has an "Unprotected Status" (UP), was declared by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area in 1989 for its waterfowl species of international character and species which are globally threatened.[5][2] Uluabat Lake is one of the breeding areas for the endangered pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus). The latest DHKD (Society for the Protection of Nature Turkey) survey in June 1998 found 823 pygmy cormorant pairs, 105 night heron pairs, 109 squacco heron pairs, and 48 spoonbill pairs breeding on Uluabat.[5]There are 21 species of fish in Lake Uluabat.[2]"

Right kite;"In Euclidean geometry, a right kite is a kite (a quadrilateral whose four sides can be grouped into two pairs of equal-length sides that are adjacent to each other) that can be inscribed in a circle.[1] That is, it is a kite with a circumcircle (i.e., a cyclic kite). Thus the right kite is a convex quadrilateral and has two opposite right angles.[2] If there are exactly two right angles, each must be between sides of different lengths. All right kites are bicentric quadrilaterals (quadrilaterals with both a circumcircle and an incircle), since all kites have an incircle. One of the diagonals (the one that is a line of symmetry) divides the right kite into two right triangles and is also a diameter of the circumcircle.In a tangential quadrilateral (one with an incircle), the four line segments between the center of the incircle and the points where it is tangent to the quadrilateral partition the quadrilateral into four right kites.A special case of right kites are squares, where the diagonals have equal lengths, and the incircle and circumcircle are concentric.A kite is a right kite if and only if it has a circumcircle (by definition). This is equivalent to its being a kite with two opposite right angles.Since a right kite can be divided into two right triangles, the following metric formulas easily follow from well known properties of right triangles. In a right kite ABCD where the opposite angles B and D are right angles, the other two angles can be calculated fromwhere a = AB = AD and b = BC = CD. The area of a right kite isThe diagonal AC that is a line of symmetry has the lengthand, since the diagonals are perpendicular (so a right kite is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral with area K=pq2{\displaystyle K={\frac {pq}{2}}}), the other diagonal BD has the lengthThe radius of the circumcircle is (according to the Pythagorean theorem)and, since all kites are tangential quadrilaterals, the radius of the incircle is given bywhere s is the semiperimeter.The area is given in terms of the circumradius R and the inradius r as[3]If we take the segments extending from the intersection of the diagonals to the vertices in clockwise order to be d1{\displaystyle d_{1}}, d2{\displaystyle d_{2}},d3{\displaystyle d_{3}}, and d4{\displaystyle d_{4}}, then,This is a direct result of the geometric mean theorem.The dual polygon to a right kite is an isosceles tangential trapezoid.[1]Sometimes a right kite is defined as a kite with at least one right angle.[4] If there is only one right angle, it must be between two sides of equal length, in this case, the formulas given above do not apply."

Country Club of Montreal;"The Country Club of Montreal (French: Le Country club de Montréal) is a private 18-hole golf course located in Saint-Lambert, Quebec, Canada. Originally dedicated to polo, the club's vocation changed to golf on November 17, 1910, making it the second oldest golf course in Greater Montreal.[1] Originally a 9-hole golf course, 9 more holes were added in subsequent years, and in 1974, the course was redesigned and modernized by Roy Dye of Pete Dye and Associates.[2]The course is 6,725 yards for a par of 72, and features a course rating of 72.8 and a slope rating of 135.[3]Golf was first played on this land in 1903, when owner Georges-Aimé Simard leased the land to a polo club and the Victoria Golf Country Club. This first country club dissolved in 1908, and Simard sold the land to the Country Club, then known as Ranelagh Golf Links, in 1911. The Montreal and Southern Counties Railway was soon extended down to Ranelagh to transport golfers to and from the city.[4]It is believed that the term "mulligan" in golf may originate from the Country Club. One account says that local businessman David Mulligan would drive friends to the Country Club for a game, and in gratitude they would let him try again if he would miss a shot.[5] The Country Club has erected a plaque to memorialize it as the birthplace of the "mulligan".[6]The Country Club was involved in the development of land to its west, along with Preville Ltd. In 1948 they successfully petitioned the Government of Quebec to have Préville incorporated as a town.[7]"

Ludvig Abelin Schou;"Ludvig Abelin Schou, known as L.A. Schou (11 January 1838, in Slagelse – 30 September 1867, in Florence), was a Danish Romantic painter, the older brother of Peter Alfred Schou.He was born to a family of merchants. When he was six, they moved to Copenhagen. At the age of eighteen, he passed the journeyman test to enter the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts.[1] He studied with Niels Simonsen and Wilhelm Marstrand and was awarded two silver medals, in 1860 and 1861, when he began exhibiting portraits and small figure compositions.[1] During 1860, he made a brief study trip to Belgium and the Netherlands.He was dissatisfied with these works, however and, after failing to win a gold medal, nearly decided to quit painting and become a teacher or clerk. His hopes were restored after a relative gave him enough money to study in Italy.He arrived in Rome in 1864 and lived in the nearby mountain villages until 1866. Despite a chronic illness, he managed to finish several genre works and hold a small exhibition. After that, he turned to works on Classical themes, completing his most familiar work depicting Chione killed by Diana (Artemis). In October 1866, he began to travel (briefly visiting Paris) and died of cholera in Florence.[1]His most ambitious work and one often described as his main work—Roman Workmen Transporting an Antique Imperial Statue from the Colosseum through the Arch of Titus to the Capitoline Museums was completed shortly before his death.[2] It combined a Romantic appreciation of ancient Rome with elements of realism in the depiction of the Roman workers and spectators, and it received high praise when displayed in Copenhagen in 1868.[2] In addition to his works of Classical mythology, he also did a series inspired by Ragnarök.The Cloth CollectorRoman Workmen..., engraving by Otto BacheHel and the Valkyries (Ragnarök)Chione Slain by Diana"

Peter Turner (physician);"Peter Turner M.D. (1542–1614) was an English physician, known as a follower of Paracelsus. He also was a Member of Parliament, during the 1580s.[1]He was the son of William Turner the churchman, Marian exile and botanist, and his wife Jane Auder. He was instructed by his father in both a religious and a scientific outlook.  After his father's death his mother remarried Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely. He graduated M.A. at St John's College, Cambridge. He then proceeded M.D. at Heidelberg in 1571, where his medical contacts included Thomas Erastus and Sigismund Melanchthon. He was incorporated M.D. at Cambridge in 1575, and on 10 July 1599 at Oxford.[2][3][4][5]Turner practised his profession in London, where, on 4 December 1582, he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians. He was promised on 4 May 1580 the reversion to the office of physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital. There he succeeded Roderigo Lopez, and was in 1584 succeeded by Timothy Bright.[2]Turner knew Thomas Penny at Heidelberg, and accompanied him on trips as a naturalist. Thomas Muffet, another associate, later mentioned Turner's work on Penny's entomological notes.[1] Turner is one of the "Lime Street naturalists" for Harkness, who also notes his reputation for chemical treatments that killed his patients.[4] Among those he treated were Roger North, 2nd Baron North and Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham.[5]Muffet's correspondence with Petrus Severinus indicates that Turner was part of the same network.[6] Muffet was the effective leader of the group of physicians including Bright and Penny as well as Turner: they were humanist followers of Paracelsus, at arm's length from the London College of Physicians.[7] When the German Valentine Russwurin, a Paracelsian with a worked-out system of treatment, was active in London, Turner accompanied him to observe his methods.[4]In politics, Turner represented Bridport in Dorset in the parliaments of 1584 and 1586. His patron is thought to have been Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.[5] He was an advocate of the Puritans in the House of Commons.[2] In the 1584–5 session he introduced a bill for a presbyterian polity, and a Reformed liturgy following John Knox, though with no outcome,[8][9] Christopher Hatton spoke against it.[10]In 1606 Turner attended Sir Walter Ralegh in the Tower of London. He died in London on 27 May 1614. He was buried near his father in the church of St. Olave's, Hart Street, London, in a coloured tomb of the Jacobean style, on which his effigy knelt in a scarlet gown.[2]Turner was the author of a medical pamphlet, The Opinion of Peter Turner, Doct. in Physicke, concerning Amulets, or Plague Cakes, London, E. Blount, 1603. It responded to a work of Francis Herring, Certaine Rules, Directions or Advertisements for this time of Pestilentiall Contagion: with a Caveat to those that weare about their Neckes impoisoned Amulets as a Preservative from the Plague (1603 first edition). Turner argued that the arsenic and orpiment in amulets was active against certain diseases, Herring replied in 1604 for the College of Physicians.[11]A Spirituall Song of Praise appended to Oliver Pygge's Meditations concerning Prayer to Almighty God for the Safety of England when the Spaniards were come into the Narrow Seas, 1588, 1589, has also been attributed to Turner.[2]Turner married Pascha, daughter of Henry Parry, chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral, and sister of Henry Parry, the  bishop of Worcester. The physician Samuel Turner and the mathematician Peter Turner were his sons.[2] This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Lee, Sidney, ed. (1899).

Ahaetulla malabarica;"The Malabar vine snake (Ahaetulla malabarica), is a species of tree snake endemic to the southern portion of the central Western Ghats of India.[1][2][3]It was formerly considered conspecific with A. nasuta, which is now considered to only be endemic to Sri Lanka. A 2020 study found A. nasuta to be a species complex of A. nasuta sensu stricto as well as A. borealis, A. farnsworthi, A. isabellina, and A. malabarica.[1]This species is distributed in the southern portion of the central Western Ghats, from the Palghat Gap in Tamil Nadu and Kerala north to Tadiandamol in Karnataka. A. farnsworthi is found to the north of the species' range and may be sympatric with it at Coorg (although largely separated by rivers), while A. isabellina is found to the south of the species' range, being separated from it by the Palghat Gap.[1]The species is found in mid-elevation evergreen forests in the Western Ghats from  ~650 to 1400 msl.[1]"

Lay Low;"Lovísa Elísabet Sigrúnardóttir (born 10 September 1982), better known by her stage name, Lay Low, is an Icelandic musician and singer.Lovísa was born to a Sri Lankan father and an Icelandic mother. She moved to Iceland at a young age where she has lived since. As a child she began taking piano lessons but started playing electric bass and guitar in her teens, and has since then played with numerous local bands. She joined the band Benny Crespo's Gang playing keyboards/synthesizers and guitar. It was then when she first started to use her voice.Lay Low, the alter ego of Lovísa, started to evolve early in 2006. She was spotted by a local label, Cod Music, which contacted her and showed an interest in a raw demo song she had published on MySpace.[1] Her music combines elements of blues, folk and country.It was a rapid rise in the music scene for Lovísa. Just a few months after her discovery she released her debut album, Please Don't Hate Me, which went gold only two months after its release.[2] The following year she was nominated for four of the 2006 Icelandic Music Awards, winning two, Best female singer and best album cover. She was also voted by the nation through phone election as the most popular artist of 2006.[3]In 2007 she was offered a role in the play Ökutímar by Leikfélag Akureyrar, writing both original songs for the play and performing covers of Dolly Parton songs. The play was a huge success and the following year saw the release of the soundtrack from the play, as well as winning the Gríman award for best music in a play. She also worked with Icelandic musician KK, performing songs for the Baltasar Kormákur film Brúðguminn, as well as  releasing an album with Benny Crespo's Gang.In mid-2008 Lovísa spent some time in London recording her third solo album, Farewell Good Night's Sleep, released on 16 October the same year. The album was recorded at Toerag Studios and produced by Liam Watson.Lovísa toured extensively in 2009, mostly supporting Emiliana Torrini in Europe and USA along with headlining shows all over the world. She also performed at festivals such as Glastonbury, End of the Road Festival and Into The Great Wide Open. The same year, Lay Low and a film crew recorded Flatey, a live CD/DVD performance on the tiny island of Flatey, which was released in September.On 4 November 2009 the movie December, a film by Hilmar Oddsson, was premiered. Lovísa played one of the leading roles in the film among renowned Icelandic actors Tómas Lemarquis, Laufey Elíasdóttir and Stefán Hallur Stefánsson. This was her first time acting for a film.The year 2010 for Lovísa started off with touring far from her home, traveling to Australia and Tokyo with Emiliana Torrini. And in the spring again she got the opportunity to work in the film industry by lending and writing a few of her songs for the film King's Road (Kóngavegur).In 2012 Lovísa supported Of Monsters and Men on their United States tour."
Madagascar at the 2016 Summer Paralympics;"Madagascar sent a delegation to compete at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 to 18 September 2016. This was the island country's fourth appearance at a Summer Paralympic Games since it made its debut sixteen years prior at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. Sprinter Revelinot Raherinandrasana was the sole athlete to represent the nation in Rio de Janeiro. In his event, the men's 1500 metres T45–T46, he finished tenth and last out of all the finishing athletes with a time of 4 minutes and 38.60 seconds.Madagascar first competed in the Paralympics at the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, Australia.[1] With the exception of the 2004 Summer Paralympics, they have sent a delegation to most Summer Paralympic Games since, making Rio de Janeiro its fourth time participating at a Summer Paralympiad.[1] The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7–18 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees (NPC) taking part.[2] Madagascar sent a solitary athlete to Rio de Janeiro: athletics competitor Revelinot Raherinandrasana.[3] He was accompanied by chef de mission and president of the Federation Malgache Handisport (the NPC of Madagascar (FMH)) Monja Dinard, FMH secretary-general Olivier Razafimandimby, doctor Mamy Andrianaly and administrative director Temisy Aristide Andriamahavonjy.[4] The delegation departed for Rio de Janeiro on 2 September.[4] Raherinandrasana was chosen as the flag bearer during the parade of nations for the opening ceremony.[3]Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories, amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness, cerebral palsy, wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories, visual impairment, including blindness, Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis.[5][6] Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.[7]Revelinot Raherinandrasana was 38 years old at the time of the Rio Summer Paralympic Games.[8] These Rio de Janeiro Games were his second time competing in the Summer Paralympics after he represented Madagascar at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.[9] Raherinandrasana is a left arm amputee and is classified as T46.[8] He qualified for the Games because the International Paralympic Committee granted him a wild card slot.[9] Monja Dinard, president of the FMH, said that the NPC expected Raherinandrasana to improve on his performance from four years earlier because it felt the runner would be more comfortable competing in a middle-distance competition rather than a sprint.[9] On 16 September, he competed in the men's 1500 metres T45–T46 event with ten other athletes.[10] Raherinandrasana finished the race in a time of 4 minutes and 38.60 seconds, which put him tenth and last of all those who finished.[n 1][10] Samir Nouioua of Algeria won the gold medal in a time of 3 minutes and 59.46 seconds, the silver medal was taken by David Emong of Uganda, and the bronze medal was claimed by Michael Roeger of Australia.[10] He did not receive official recognition for his performance because of a lack of focus on sport in Madagascar and he returned to his job as a laundry worker with his wife.[11]"
Inkan aarre;"Inkan aarre (Finnish for "The treasure of the Inca") is a 2005 Finnish board game, designed by Kari Mannerla as a direct sequel to his 1951 board game Afrikan tähti.Inkan aarre is mostly similar to Afrikan tähti. Players take turns to move around a board of interconnected cities, picking up tokens in search for the famous treasure of the Inca, a golden sun god statue.The board represents the continent of South America, and the currency used is the Mexican peso. All players start from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Once the treasure of the Inca has been found, the first player to take either the treasure or a sun icon to Machu Picchu, Peru, wins the game.This Finland-related article is a stub.

Polarornis;"Polarornis is a genus of prehistoric bird, possibly an anserimorph. It contains a single species Polarornis gregorii, known from incomplete remains of one individual found on Seymour Island, Antarctica, in rocks which are dated to the Late Cretaceous (López de Bertodano Formation, about 66 Ma).The discovery of Polarornis gregorii was first announced by Sankar Chatterjee in 1989, but he did not describe and officially name the species until 2002.[1][2] The name Polarornis had been announced unofficially several years prior to its official publication, in Chatterjee's 1997 book The Rise of Birds.[3]The relationships of this species are unclear. It is often claimed to be an ancestor of modern loons (divers), but some scientists have questioned this. Gerald Mayr, for example, noted that Polarornis differed from loons in some important characteristics, and criticized Chatterjee's original description of the fossils for overstating the specimen's completeness.[4] Before the official description of the species, Alan Feduccia published an opinions casting doubt on its identification as a loon.[5] However, other Mesozoic bird specialists, including Storrs Olson and Sylvia Hope, have supported the classification of Polarornis as an early member of the loon lineage.[6][7]Some recent studies seem to vindicate its status as a stem-loon,[8] alongside Neogaeornis and some unnamed Antarctic specimens, it seems to suggest a Gondwanan origin for this clade, possibly displaced northwards by early penguins. However, in 2017, a phylogenetic study, Agnolín and colleagues have found Neogaeornis and Polarornis to be stem-anseriforms along with Australornis and Vegavis in the family Vegaviidae.[9]Polarornis was in all likelihood aquatic and fed on fish and large invertebrates, probably being an ecological equivalent of loons, grebes, or the Cretaceous Hesperornithes of the Northern Hemisphere. One analysis of the structure of the femur (TTU P 9265) showed that the bones were dense, rather than hollow and lightweight as in flying birds, suggesting that Polarornis was a flightless or near-flightless diving bird similar to hesperornithines and penguins.[10]"

Orchestre symphonique de Paris;"The Orchestra Symphonique de Paris (Symphonic Orchestra of Paris) was an orchestra principally active in Paris from 1928 to 1939.The orchestra was co-founded by Ernest Ansermet, Louis Fourestier and Alfred Cortot and gave its first concert on 19 October 1928 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.[1]The financial support for the orchestra came from wealthy sponsors such as Gustave Lyon, director of Pleyel, two banker Ménard brothers, and the Princess de Polignac.[1]   Members of the management board were Robert Lyon (general administrator), Charles Kiesgen (administrative secretary), André Schaeffner (artistic secretary) along with Henri Monnet and Jean Gehret. Financial difficulties forced the orchestra to become an association in mid 1931.[2]The aim of the new orchestra was to present less-known works of major composers as well as contemporary music and the central concert repertoire, playing to a high standard.[3] The standard of the orchestra was considered to be high, partly due to the number of rehearsals before each concert.[1][4] Of the eighty musicians chosen (out of 600 auditioned) the majority were under 25.[2]From 1929 Pierre Monteux was invited by Cortot to become closely involved with the orchestra as artistic director and principal conductor. Monteux made his debut with them on 12 April that year, conducting a major spring festival, at the end of the first season the orchestra had given 63 concerts. The season also saw the first recording by the orchestra (although referred to as ‘Grand Orchestra Symphonique’): the premiere recording in May of The Rite of Spring, conducted by Monteux, at the refurbished Salle Pleyel.[2]New works premiered by the orchestra included Rugby in 1928, Capriccio for piano and orchestra in 1929 both under Ansermet, Poulenc’s Concert Champêtre (with Wanda Landowska), Prokofiev’s 3rd symphony under Monteux, as well as Paris premieres of Janáček's Sinfonietta and fragments from Berg’s Wozzeck.The orchestra toured to Belgium and Holland in 1930, then in late 1931 to fifteen cities, including Hamburg, Cologne, Berlin, Dresden and Vienna, in 1932 to Brussels and in 1933 to Geneva.[2] Other recordings with the orchestra include Ravel's La Valse, Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, the Bach Double Concerto (with Menuhin and Enescu), and Fête Polonaise from Le roi malgré lui under Monteux,[5] the Symphonie Espagnole under Coppola, works by Gaubert conducted by the composer, Soviet music (Shostakovich, Alexander Mosolov, Yuliy Meitus) conducted by Julius Ehrlich, as well as Bach played by Cortot."

St John the Evangelist Church, Ridgeway;"St John the Evangelist Church is a grade II listed Church of England church situated at Ridgeway, within the parish of Eckington, Derbyshire England.The church opened in 1840, having cost £2,000 to build. The tower was added in 1884. In 1984 changes were made so that the church could be used as a community centre.The Anglican church was built between 1839 and 1840[1] as a result of the growing population in the village. The dedication service was on 22 September 1840.[2] Prior to the church being built, residents of the hamlet attended the St Peter and St Paul's Church in the nearby village of Eckington.[3] The church was designed in a Gothic style by the architectural firm of Woodhead and Hurst,[4] at a cost of £2,000.[5] The tower and its bell was installed  in 1884.[5]In 1984 alterations were made to enable use as a community centre.[4] One of the stained glass windows is a memorial to Judy Farrer a long serving church warden.[6] The church was designated as a Grade II listed building in 1989.[4]The parish is within the benefice of Eckington and Ridgeway within the Diocese of Derby.[7]The coal measures sandstone building has ashlar dressings and a Welsh slate roof.

Arnie Herber;"Arnold Charles Herber (April 2, 1910 – October 14, 1969) was an American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, primarily with the Green Bay Packers. During his Packers tenure from 1930 to 1940, he led the league in passing yards and touchdowns three times and won four NFL Championship Games. Herber retired after 11 seasons in Green Bay, but returned in 1944 with New York Giants, where he played his final two seasons. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966.Born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Herber was a Packers fan from a young age, all while starring at local Green Bay West High School in football and basketball.[1][2] He played two years of college football, on the freshman team at University of Wisconsin–Madison and spent his sophomore season at Regis College in Denver,[1] which dropped football after the 1929 season.[2] Herber went back to Green Bay and worked in the club house as a handyman.  Coach Curly Lambeau gave Herber a try-out and Herber at age 20 joined a team that was currently dominating the NFL.[3]Green Bay had posted an undefeated 12–0–1 record and won the NFL title in 1929, the year before Herber was on the roster. In his first year, 1930, the Packers continued their success and won another title with Herber playing tailback in the famous Notre Dame Box formation.  In 1931, with Herber throwing more than usual for that era to early greats like John "Blood" McNally, the Packers reeled off nine straight wins to start the season and held on to win a third straight title.  No other team in NFL history, besides the Packers themselves in the 1960s, has won three consecutive titles.The NFL did not start keeping statistics until 1932—when they did that year, Herber finished as the top passer in the league with 639 yards and nine touchdowns.  He won the passing title again in 1934 with 799 yards and eight touchdowns.[4] But Herber reached his peak as a pro starting in 1935 with the arrival of Don Hutson, the league's first true wide receiver, who changed the game with his graceful moves, precise patterns, and superb hands.  Herber loved to throw the ball long and was a perfect fit for Hutson's talent.  Hutson's first NFL reception was an 83-yard touchdown pass from Herber on the first play of the game when the Packers beat the Chicago Bears, 7–0.  In 1936, Herber and Hutson rewrote (temporarily) the NFL passing-receiving record book.  Herber tossed a record 177 passes for a record 1,239 yards, and 11 touchdowns.  Hutson set new records with 34 catches, 526 yards receiving, and eight touchdowns, all marks he would soon improve.  Green Bay finished 10-1-1 and went to the NFL title game, which they won 21-6 over the Boston Redskins at the Polo Grounds in New York. In that game, Green Bay passed for 153 yards and Herber threw two touchdowns, one to Hutson.Sharing time with another great passer, Cecil Isbell, Herber led the Packers to the title game again in 1938 and 1939.  In the 1938 championship game, Green Bay lost to the New York Giants 23–17 at the Polo Grounds despite another touchdown pass from Herber.  In 1939, Green Bay avenged that loss with a 27–0 drubbing of the Giants in Milwaukee.[5][6]  Herber threw for another touchdown in the 1939 title game.[7] In 1940, Isbell began to get more playing time and Herber was waived at the end of training camp in 1941,[8] and retired after 11 seasons with Green Bay.At age 34, Herber came back to the draft-depleted NFL in 1944, answering a call to play for the New York Giants.[9] Herber threw sparingly but efficiently, for 651 yards and six touchdowns.  As usual for Herber-led teams, the Giants won their conference and went to the NFL title game.  Herber's old squad, the Packers, still featuring Don Hutson, beat the Giants 14-7.  Herber played one more forgettable season with the Giants in 1945 and then retired for good.Overall, Herber passed for 8,041 yards, 81 touchdowns, and 106 interceptions.  He led his teams to four NFL championships. At the time Herber retired for the first time in 1940, he had equaled Benny Friedman for the all-time lead in touchdown passes with 66. He added to his total later when he came out of retirement for a two-year stint with the New York Giants.Herber was the first great long thrower in the NFL and his success paved the way for truly "modern" quarterbacks Sammy Baugh and Sid Luckman.  Herber was said to throw the ball with all five fingers on the laces, a peculiarity shared by no one else.  It was his performance with Don Hutson, however, that made him a legend and assured his place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966.[10] He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1968.[11]During the NFL's 50th season celebration in 1969, Herber was selected to the All-1930s team in August.[12] Two months later, he died of cancer at age 59 in Green Bay,[13] and is buried at its Fort Howard Memorial Park."

Mu Us Desert;"The Mu Us Desert (Mongolian: ᠮᠠᠭᠤ ᠤᠰᠤ magu usu Ordos: [mʊː ʊsʊ̆] 'bad (lacking) water', also known as the Maowusu Desert, simplified Chinese: 毛乌素沙漠 (沙地), traditional Chinese: 毛烏素沙漠 (沙地), pinyin: Máowūsù Shāmò (Shādì)) is a desert in northern China.[1] Its south-eastern end is crossed by the Great Wall of China. The Mu Us forms the southern portion of the Ordos Desert[2] and part of the Ordos Loop. The Wuding River drains the area, and then flows into the Yellow River.[3][4]Confusion exists about where the Ordos Desert begins and where the Mu Us Desert ends. The Ordos comprises two sub-deserts: the Kubuqi Desert in the north east, and the Mu Us Desert in the south. The northern portion goes by another name—for example, a map in Julia Lovell's book The Great Wall: China Against the World 1000 BC–2000 AD shows the Ordos Desert only in the portion of Inner Mongolia which lies south of the Yellow River. Several research papers cited below claim that the Mu Us Desert includes part of Shaanxi and Gansu. A clear delineation of the area is still needed here, based on multiple sources.[4]The Mu Us Desert of north central China lies at 37°30'–39°20'N,107°20'–111°30'E and covers 48,288 km2.[5] As part of the Ordos Plateau, the elevation ranges from 1,000m to 1,300m (as low as 950m in some south-eastern valleys, and reaching between 1,400m to 1,600m in the north-western area). It is the only one of China's twelve sandy zones that is in the transition between a typical steppe and desert climate. The semi-arid continental climate subjects the soil to wind erosion.[6][7]As noted above, the Mu Us Desert forms part of Ordos Plateau and includes part of the Loess Plateau alluvial plain with a concave floor. Exposed sands in the area come from Cretaceous red and grey sandstone. Quaternary sediments include a variety of sand types which are easily moved by the wind. In the south of the Great Wall (see below), sand dunes become more frequent due to damaged vegetation caused mostly by moving sand.[7] Groundwater is present at relatively shallow depth of between 1 and 3 meter below ground level in area between dunes.[8]The annual mean temperature is between 6.0 and 8.5 °C. The mean annual precipitation is between 250 and 400 mm, of which the majority falls in summer.[9]Research in the Salawusu River Area in 1978 delineated the strata of the Salawusu River in the area of the Mu Us Desert. This suggests that the prehistoric climate was mild and wet with numerous rivers and lakes, yet limited plant life and wildlife in the early stage of the Late Pleistocene age. The climate became dry and cold while eolian sand began to accumulate in the later stage of the Late Pleistocene age. The climate changed again to mild and wet early in the Holocene Epoch as lakes with marsh sediments formed. Later, the climate changed back to dry and cold, allowing a semi-arid steppe landscape to form. These climatic fluctuations were caused by the glacial and interglacial periods of the Northern Hemisphere. The Mu Us Desert underwent a series of changes, including the formation shifting sands as well as the fixation and reduction of dunes.[10]As early as 218 BC, grazing was the main way of life for local people.[11]  The Mu Us Desert lies in a transition zone where areas of both pastoral land and farmland co-exist.[4]Based on remote sensing data, rangeland has experienced an increase in both total biomass and number of grazing animals. Active measures which have been taken to limit desertification have resulted in increased vegetation cover and lowered potential for wind erosion. The increase in biomass resulted in an increase in both grazing and farmland production. The area under cultivation increased fivefold from 1978 to 1996. The grasslands seem to be thriving under the current high levels of grazing pressure.[12]During a 35-year period from the 1950s to the 1990s, its landscapes changed significantly. In most of the desert, desertification developed rapidly, swallowing grassland, while marginal areas in the east and south were restored to some extent. By the late 1990s, shifting and semi-fixed deserts covered 45% and 21% of the Mu Us Desert, while fixed desert decreased by 7.2% of the entire desert. Desertification was much more severe in the middle and north-west pasture land areas than in the eastern and southern areas of farmland and pasture. Overuse, overgrazing, and overcutting have been the main causes of desertification.[13] Meanwhile, woodland area increased between 1965 and 2010. As a result of the Grain for Green policy, after 2000, the area of cultivated land was decreased.[14]To rehabilitate desertified land,  Dong, et al.[10] recommended abandoning unsustainable land management practices in 1982, referring to them as "the current irrational human activities" and gaining a better understanding of how climatic change affects the natural environment. Those writers suggested that the human activities must be carefully managed to meet both human and environmental needs.After 1949, the Chinese government carried out a variety of ecological restoration projects including sand stabilization, irrigation development, afforestation, soil improvement, and transformation of the desert with remarkable results.[7]A 2017 study marked that desertification was controlled, but that the area was still at risk for new desertification in the future, as a result of grassland reclamation and groundwater consumption.[14]As early as 453 BC, the Yiju people built a double wall in the southern region of the Mu Us Desert to protect themselves against the northernmost Chinese states. Of these states, the Qin were especially threatening, although the Qin dynasty also are reported to have done wall building in the area. Later in history, the Qin dominated all of this area and built walls. In 129 BC, the Han dynasty gained control of the area and strengthened the walls although they were still fighting to maintain control in AD 45. Much later, the Ming dynasty portion of the Great Wall crossed the area.[4][11]"
Ichthyofilaroides;"Ichthyofilaroides is a genus of parasitic nematodes, belonging to the family Guyanemidae Petter, 1974. Species of Ichthyofilaroides are parasitic as adults in  fish, in the musculature, surface of visceral organs and body cavity.[1] According to the World Register of Marine Species, the genus currently (2021) includes a single species, Ichthyofilaroides novaecaledoniensis (Moravec et Justine, 2009) Moravec & Justine, 2020.[2] This species was originally described in 2009 as Ichthyofilaria novaecaledoniensis,[3] then transferred to the genus Ichthyofilaroides in 2020 to become the type-species of the genus.The new genus was differentiated from Ichthyofilaria mainly by the presence of the buccal capsule and the number and arrangement of the cephalic papillae. Moravec & Justine (2020) added that "since the buccal capsule has not yet been described in any species of the Guyanemidae, it may be necessary to create a new family for Ichthyofilaroides in the future. Nevertheless, since the male of its type species remains unknown, we provisionally assign Ichthyofilaroides to the family Guyanemidae, subfamily Travassosneminae."Ichthyofilaroides novaecaledoniensis (Moravec et Justine, 2009) Moravec & Justine, 2020 is a parasite of a deep-sea fish, the Lemon ghost flathead Hoplichthys citrinus Gilbert (Hoplichthyidae, Scorpaeniformes), caught off New Caledonia.

Mustique;"Mustique /mʌˈstiːk/ is a small private island in the nation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which is part of the Grenadines, a chain of islands in the West Indies. The island is located within Grenadines Parish, and the closest island is the uninhabited Petite Mustique, located 1 mile (1.6 km) to the south. Ferry service is provided to the island from St. Vincent on the M/V Endeavour.[2]The island covers 1,400 acres (5.7 km2, 2.2 sq mi) and has several coral reefs. The land fauna includes tortoises, herons, iguanas and many other species. Its year-round population of about 500 mostly live in the villages of Lovell, Britannia Bay and Dovers. The population rises to 1,200 in peak season.The island is owned by the Mustique Company, a private limited company which is in turn owned by the island's home owners. The island has around 120 private villas, many of which are let through the Mustique Company.[3] The Cotton House, the only hotel (with seventeen rooms), and Beach Café are owned by the Mustique Company.[4][5] A separate restaurant, the Veranda, is also in operation.[6]The history of European settlement of the island of Mustique, and of the Grenadines in general, dates back to the Fifteenth century, when Spanish navigators first sighted this more-or-less linear group of small rocky islands and named them "Los Pájaros" or "the birds", because they resembled a small flock scattered across the sea. During the seventeenth century the islands were renamed the Grenadines by pirates, who used the sheltered bays to hide their ships and loot.The Islands were originally inhabited by people who probably arrived from South America around 2500 BC, subsequently by the Arawaks from 250 BC to 1000 AD, and later by the Caribs, whose simple tools can still be found.[7] The indigenous people was soon outnumbered by European planters in the 1740s, who found they could grow sugar there in abundance, using enslaved African labour. Because Europe's only sources of sugar at that time were limited quantities from the Canaries and Cyprus, the West Indies became economically significant. The Grenadines passed from France to the British in 1763, farmers Alexander Campbell and John Aitcheson bought the island of Mustique that year. The British built three forts.[7] Cotton and sugar continued to be grown until 1834.[8]The name Mustique comes from the French moustique, "mosquito". The sugar industry lasted until the 19th century, when the cultivation of European-grown sugar beet dramatically reduced the demand for tropical sugar. Mustique's seven plantations were abandoned and eventually swallowed up by scrub, leaving remnants such as the sugar mill at "Endeavour" and its "Cotton House". The Plantation House was built in the 18th century.The island was mostly abandoned in the 1800s[7] but in 1835 (after the abolition of slavery), two plantations were reopened after ownership of the island passed to the Hazell family. They grew crops and raised sheep and goats on two plantations, they maintained a school for the island locals.[8] In 1865 the two were merged into one estate by the family.[9]Mustique was purchased from the Hazell family[10] in 1958 for £45,000 by The Hon. Colin Tennant, who became The 3rd Baron Glenconner in 1983. He initially planned to start farming, "sea island cotton, beef and mutton" but then decided to develop the island into an exclusive hideaway, after forming The Mustique Company in 1968.[11][12] By that time, cotton production was failing.[8]A report details the state of the island in 1958:[8]Apart from the villagers’ smallholdings, Mustique was a desolate island covered in jungle, scrub and cactus. It had no natural water, no roads, no jetty for landing a boat and millions of mosquitoes. There was one dilapidated building used for picking over the cotton, and the remaining villagers lived in corrugated tin shacks which desperately needed upgrading.Significant improvements would be made over the subsequent years. According to a 2018 report, "since the 1960s, Mustique has been an exclusive sanctuary for royalty, rock stars, celebrities and heads of industry to relax in anonymity".[13]In 1960, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, the sister of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, accepted as a wedding present Colin Tennant's gift of a 10-acre (40,000 m2) plot of land, where she built a villa called Les Jolies Eaux.[12] She spent time on the island during her honeymoon. In the early 1970s, the princess often visited the island in the company of  Roddy Llewellyn. Mustique, she said, "is the only place I can relax".[14] Before her death, the princess gave the property to her son David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley to avoid later payment of inheritance tax. He sold it in 1999 for a reported £2.4 million and Les Jolies Eaux was made available for rent.[15]In 1964, a new settlement was built, Lovell Village.[16] The original inhabitants of the island were each given a plot of land and a new home in this location.[17] Most of the island locals, who work in Mustique, (roughly 500 people) [18] live in Lovell and for years were served by a church, school, restaurant, a medical clinic, a store and a police station.[19][8] A May 2019 report indicates that other businesses are now located in the Lovell area: "a seafood market ... a food market, two stores The Purple House and The Pink House ... and a general store that advertised liquor, wine and cigars".[20] Serving locals and some tourists, the View Restaurant and Bar is located in Lovell.[21]When The Mustique Company was formed in 1968, its new manager Hugo Money-Coutts obtained import and other tax free status in return for an annual fee. Building and sales of the villas started soon afterwards.[8]The airport began operation in 1969. In that year, several new villas were built, and the Cotton House opened as a hotel. In the following years, roads were built (although golf carts and ATVs are the only powered mode of transport), electricity and communications became reliable, a desalination plant was built to provide potable water, and a medical clinic was opened. The costs of running the island school and medical facility are supported by an educational and medical trust. One report states that "since 1968, more than $100 million has been invested in Mustique".[9]In 1971, the SS Antilles, referred to locally as the Antilles packboat, struck a reef not far off of the island and sank.[22]In 1976, due to financial problems, Tennant sold a controlling interest (60%) in The Mustique Company to a consortium led by Hans Neumann, a Venezuelan industrialist of Czech origin who had survived the Holocaust by hiding in plain sight in Berlin.[23] Neumann took over control of the island and, in 1979, appointed Brian Alexander to take over its management.  Alexander did not retire until August 2008.[24] During Alexander's tenure, homes were built for workers on the island.[25]Tennant remained the owner of a plot on the island until moving to St. Lucia in 1992.[14] However, by 1987, Tennant had sold his remaining shares of The Mustique Company to Hans Neumann. After 2007, major improvements were made on the island including a desalination plant, solar panels to provide electricity and the recycling of certain types of trash.[8]In 1988 Hans Neumann set up the ownership structure as it is today and Mustique Island was transformed into a private limited company with the 104 homeowners as minority shareholders.[26] Until 2003, Hans Neumann followed by his daughter Ariana Neumann retained a seat on the board and a block of 30% of the shares, which continued to provide stability over the years as it prevented dramatic policy shifts or substantial deviations from the development plan.[27]As of 2019, The Mustique Company is managed by Roger Pritchard, who replaced Brian Alexander. He leads a staff of 450 who oversee every aspect of island life, management of the villas and security.[28] The security and fire services are provided by a team of officers led by a former Scotland Yard chief. Every visitor must be registered with the security force.[29]The Mustique Charitable Foundation has been funding programmes for the island locals, such as scholarships, arranging for surgeons to visit the island and literacy programmes since 2018.[30] The Mustique Charitable Trusts funds projects such as Disaster Management Education, refurbishment of the Milton Cato Memorial Hospital in Saint Vincent, school meal programmes, some literacy projects and after-school programmes, diabetes and hypertension screening, a hospice and tree planting.[31]Mustique Island has many notable features. One of the most notable is Basil's Bar in Britannia Bay. The Bar remains situated right on the water overlooking a striking-blue bay that provides mooring for yachts.The business was owned by Basil Charles for over twenty years, he was previously the barman at Tennant's Cotton House Hotel. In 2017, however he had sold the operation to The Mustique Company.[14] After a renovation, the bar reopened in 2018. One report states that "the makeover of Basil’s Bar sought to pay homage to its heritage (a legendary island institution), while updating it in a chic, sophisticated and playful way. New features include the open kitchen and hide-away corners for private moments".[32] A jump-up is held every Wednesday night (as of 2019) at this restaurant/bar and on Sundays, it hosts Sunset Jazz evenings, both with live music.[33] The Mustique Blues Festival in late January and early February is held at Basil's Bar.[13]There are no golf courses on the island[34] but the official website describes the activities available, in addition to tennis and picnicking:[35]...scuba diving and sailing, to tennis club and exploring the island on horseback. Try the extreme sports of kite-surfing or deep sea diving and fishing, or take a more gentle approach, with a snorkel in the many hidden coves around the island followed by a nurturing spa treatment. Children are indulged with a host of fun activities, with water sports galore, drive in cinemas for golf buggies, tennis, pony camp, beach picnics and treasure hunts, kite flying competitions and children’s menus everywhere.The primary beach is Macaroni on the Atlantic side, large waves make it more suitable for surfing than for swimming. Lagoon Beach on the west side is calmer "but too shallow and seaweedy for swimming" according to one review. Gelliceaux, a sheltered bay, is preferable for swimming.[5]Villas for rent (from $8,000 for one bedroom to $150,000 per week for 6+ bedrooms)[36] include the royals' Les Jolies Eaux, the Indonesian-style Mandalay (built for David Bowie), Pangolin, a seven-bedroom Balinese home, Toucan Hill with its Moroccan theme[36] and a "travertine-like palace". Boats can be chartered at Endeavor Bay.[6][37]The Mustique Medical Clinic is open daily and there is an island pharmacy. In case of serious medical issues, evacuation can be arranged to Martinique or Miami.[38]The island has become well known for a core set of personalities whose influence created Mustique's current cachet: Lord Glenconner, Oliver Messel, Princess Margaret, Tommy Hilfiger and Mick Jagger. Immediately prior to that, the island was home to fishermen.[39]The late Elizabeth II, Queen of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and her late husband, The Duke of Edinburgh, made private visits to Mustique in 1966, 1977 and 1985.[40] Prince William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales, holiday in Mustique often.[41]David Bowie once owned an Indonesian-inspired multi-pavilion villa on the island, which he called Britannia Bay. However, he stopped visiting it, explaining that "the house was so tranquil and peaceful that he found it hard to get any work done."[42][43] In 1994 Bowie then sold the property for $5 million to business tycoon and poet Felix Dennis.[44] After the death of Felix Dennis in June 2014,[45] and renamed as the Mandalay Estate, the house  was sold to the entrepreneur Simon Dolan. In 1996, while on holiday at Mustique, Noel Gallagher wrote and demoed many of the songs that would later be released on the Oasis album Be Here Now (1997).[46]The British fashion designer Lotty B has been an island resident for twenty years and runs a local boutique called The Pink House.[47]Painter Stefan Szczesny has been visiting the island since 1995 and is currently[when?] working there on his art.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds spent Christmas 2019 on Mustique with the Bismarck family.[48]Other well-known individuals who have holidayed on Mustique over the years include Liam Gallagher, Johnny Depp, Kate Moss, Paul McCartney, Jon Bon Jovi, Peter Lynch, Denzel Washington, Pierre Lagrange, Tom Ford, John Travolta and Bryan Adams.[36][34]Several wealthy people have acquired land on Mustique, which grants them access to the island's private airline and other resources.

The lawsuit also includes David Alpert, who was Smith's agent and who remains a business partner with Robert Kirkman, and who is one of Fear's executive producers, Smith's lawsuit asserts that Alpert violated his fiduciary duty to protect Smith's interests when he began working on Fear. AMC attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed, stating that once one stripped out generic elements of the zombie genre, there were no further similarities between the works. In February 2019, judge Lucy Koh rejected this, believing that it would be necessary to have a discovery phase and expert testimony to evaluate AMC's stance.[156]In March 2019, AMC settled the lawsuit, details remained confidential.[157]"

Church of Saint Mary the Virgin (Chappaqua, New York);"The Church of Saint Mary the Virgin is an Episcopal church located on South Greeley Avenue in Chappaqua, New York, United States. It was built in the early years of the 20th century on land donated by Horace Greeley's daughter Gabrielle and her husband, himself a priest of the Episcopal Church. In 1979 it was one of several properties associated with Greeley in Chappaqua listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Church of Saint Mary Virgin and Greeley Grove.[2]During his 1872 campaign for President, in which he ran unsuccessfully as the first and only nominee of the Liberal Republican Party against eventual winner Ulysses S. Grant, Greeley, then editor of the New York Tribune, had hosted a massive lunch and reception on the property. He had planted the large grove of evergreen trees 16 years earlier as a windbreak for his farm, part of his campaign to promote reforestation and conservation. After the election but before the counting of the electoral votes, Greeley died, and Gabrielle inherited the farm, which at the time covered most of what is now downtown Chappaqua.When Gabrielle's daughter Muriel died in childhood in 1903, she and her husband, The Rev. Dr. Frank Clendenin, built the church as a private chapel. Architect Morgan O'Brien designed a stone Gothic Revival building that closely copied the 15th-century Church of Saint Mary the Virgin in Monken Hadley, England. Two years later, an original stained glass window from that church was given to the Chappaqua copy. In 1916 the Clendenins transferred it to the Diocese of New York, with some stipulations in the deed, among them that they and their children remain buried in a small plot at the rear of the church.[3] It has since become a parish church, its annual Strawberry Festival is one of Chappaqua's most popular events.The church is located just south of downtown Chappaqua, on a 4-acre (1.6 ha) parcel on the east side of South Greeley Avenue. It is in a level area along the headwaters of the Saw Mill River between the hills that otherwise dominate northern Westchester County. To its north is Robert E. Bell Middle School. Both buildings have large lawns on their deep setbacks from the street. Greeley Grove, with many evergreen trees over 150 feet (46 m) high,[1]  is to the south, east and some of the west. In the former direction it provides a buffer between the church and the more modern Chappaqua library, in the latter the ground rises sharply to residential property along Aldridge Road.[4]Across the street is a baseball diamond, providing open space between the church and the New Castle town hall to the southwest. Beyond it, and beyond the diamond's outfield fence, are the parking lots of the Chappaqua station on Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, whose tracks parallel both the Saw Mill River and eponymous parkway to their west.[5] The old stone station building, currently used as a waiting area and café, is also listed on the Register along with the semicircular plaza across from it, which features a statue of Horace Greeley since his daughter and son-in-law also donated the land for the station.[6]From the middle school parking lot a driveway goes south to the church building. It is a cruciform-plan one-and-a-half-story fieldstone structure topped by a steeply pitched gabled roof covered in shingles. At the west (front) end is a three-story square tower with a round turret on its northwest corner. On its north side is a small one-story flat-roofed extension. A parish hall, with a gabled roof pierced by gabled dormer windows, is off to the northeast.The church's corners have stone buttresses, alternately smooth-faced and fieldstone. At the main and rear (east) end are entrances with a pointed-arched wooden door set in a gray square surround, a set of stone steps with iron railings lead to the main entrance from the driveway, flanked by rhododendrons and other trimmed shrubbery. Its windows are either round-arched or pointed-arched, with sills and lintels of smooth stone. The east end is set with a single round oculus. At the gables a low parapet marks the roofline.On the tower, the buttresses rise two stories to a stone cornice, which separates the two stages. It has a slight rise above the pointed-arch window below corresponding to the width of the round-arched window above. Above that story, another cornice sets off the battlements at the roofline. The turret has two narrow windows. It, too, is topped by battlements but not divided into stages. The extension on the north wall also has battlements.From its settlement by Quakers in the early 18th century, Chappaqua had been a small self-sufficient farming community clustered around the meetinghouse, today at the center of the Register-listed Old Chappaqua Historic District a half-mile (800 m) north of downtown along King Street (New York State Route 120). The construction of the New York and Harlem Railroad through the area in the middle of the 19th century changed that. The farmers started growing cash crops for the New York City market newly available to them, and the city began coming to Chappaqua.[7]Its first commuter was Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune. He saw a chance to distance himself from his professional life in the city and give his wife and daughter a quiet life in the country. In addition, he wanted to test out the experimental farming techniques he advocated in his column, widely read in much of rural America. One of them was the planting of the grove, which in addition to being visually appealing also fit in with his support for conservation and reforestation. By 1872, it had grown so large and impressive he held a large reception there in support of his candidacy for president that year on the Liberal Republican and Democratic lines.[7]He ultimately lost that year, as Ulysses S. Grant was re-elected. After the election but before the Electoral College voted, he died. His daughter Gabrielle inherited the family farm, which then consisted of 100 acres (40 ha) in what is now downtown Chappaqua.[7]Later in the century Gabrielle and her husband, The Rev. Dr. Frank Clendenin, priest rector of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in the city, began subdividing the property. When their daughter Muriel died of polio in 1903 at the age of five, they commissioned a memorial chapel next to the grove Horace Greeley had planted. Architect Morgan O'Brien produced a Gothic Revival design that closely copied Saint Mary the Virgin Church, a parish church built in 1494 in Monken Hadley, England, on the outskirts of London.[1] It was completed in 1904 and consecrated in 1906, with a stained glass window, now in the north transept, donated from the English church.[3]In 1913 the church became a mission church of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Three years later, the Clendenins transferred title of the four-acre (1.6-ha) parcel to the Diocese. They made several stipulations:In the event the diocese failed to meet any of those conditions, ownership would revert to the Clendenins or any living heirs. They are still in force today, an heir, Gabrielle and Frank's grandson, lives in Germany.[3]Three years later, in 1919, a malfunctioning basement furnace caused a fire which did significant damage to the interior. In its aftermath several changes were made. Large screens and a baldachin which had closed off the transepts were never replaced. Instead a large pulpit was installed, with altar rails and prayer stalls lining the sanctuary.[3] A carillon, dedicated to the memory of Alfred Smith Holland, a railroad executive close to the Clendenins, was added to the tower in 1924.[1]Frank Clendenin had retired from St. Peter's in 1917. Gabrielle Clendenin Stahl, another daughter, died three years later, in 1920. The family continued to worship at the church they had built through their deaths in the 1930s. The Clendenins and all four of their children are buried in the small plot they arranged for, per their stipulations with the diocese. Sometime later in that decade, the pulpit installed after the 1919 fire was removed.[3]In 1938 the church's women's auxiliary organized the first Strawberry Festival. It has been held ever since, featuring many events for children, including rides and walks through the paths of Greeley Grove.[1]  The following year it organized a social event for adults that also became an annual tradition, the Black Tie Dance. In 1943, the church was incorporated as a parish, the following year it was admitted into the diocese. The new parish took over the diocese's title to the property in 1949, with the Clendenins' stipulations remaining in effect.[3]As the only Episcopal church in Chappaqua, Saint Mary's needed to be able to serve the needs of its new parish. Construction began on the parish hall in the 1950s. The first floor was done in 1951 and the entire building was complete three years later. In 1955 a baptistry, copied from the original in Monken Hadley and made in England, was installed.[1]The church building remained unchanged, save for a replacement organ in the mid-1960s,[8] until 1982. Renovations to the sanctuary that year removed the altar rails and prayer stalls installed after the fire over 60 years earlier. The masonry altar and altar stone were replaced with a freestanding altar and moved to the outdoors, where they were placed on the hillside.[3]On Sunday mornings the church offers two services. The Holy Eucharist is performed using Rite I at the earlier time, and Rite II at the later.[9] An extensive lay ministry assists the pastor, currently Father Joel Mason, with the ceremonies.[10]The church also has an extensive music program. A senior choir of adults performs at the later morning service every week, daily during Holy Week and four times a year during Evensong services. Its repertoire is mainly focused on traditional Anglican music, but also includes more modern work by Igor Stravinsky and John Tavener. The children's choir sings at services once a month. The religious music is supplemented by Ars Antiqua secular performances held three times a year at the church.[8]Every June, the church holds its annual Strawberry Festival, considered the longest-running community event of its kind in Westchester County, attracting visitors from all over the county. The main attraction is food prepared by the church's members based around the titular fruit, such as strawberry shortcake, strawberry pancakes, chocolate-coivered strawberries and strawberry smoothies. Other traditional summertime festival fare, such as ice cream donated by Ben & Jerry's, hot dogs, hamburgers, popcorn and cotton candy, is also available. Craft vendors sell hand-made textile and wooden items. There are also attractions for children like bouncy houses, pony rides in the Grove, and face painting. Money raised by the festival goes to support the church's involvement in local charitable programs like food pantries.[11]While not affiliated with the church, Chappaqua's popular farmer's market is held in the parish house during the winter months.[12]"
Southern Pacific class AC-5;"Southern Pacific Railroad's AC-5 class of steam locomotives was the railroad's second class of 4-8-8-2 cab forward locomotives.  They were built between July and September 1929 and placed in service soon after construction.  The AC-5 class was only slightly larger than the AC-4 class.The first locomotive of this class, number 4110, holds the dubious honor of being the first 4-8-8-2 cab forward locomotive to be scrapped when it befell this fate on February 3, 1953, at the railroad's Sacramento, California, shops.  The rest of the class were removed from service and scrapped by mid-1955.  None of this class was preserved."
Raffles (1939 film);"Raffles is a 1939 American crime comedy film starring David Niven and Olivia de Havilland, and is one of several film adaptations of an 1899 short story collection by E. W. Hornung, The Amateur Cracksman.A.J. Raffles, the celebrated cricketer, is welcomed in the parlours and country estates of high society. This circumstance he uses to his advantage in his secret career as "The Amateur Cracksman", a master burglar and safecracker who remains always one step ahead of Scotland Yard. An old school friend, Bunny Manders, reintroduces Raffles to his sister, Gwen, with whom Raffles had been infatuated a decade ago. Raffles falls in love with her all over again, and she with him. When Bunny confides a crushing gambling debt over which he is considering suicide, Raffles assures him the money can be obtained. He plans to accept a weekend invitation to the country house of Lord and Lady Melrose, Lady Melrose's famous jewelry can easily solve Bunny's problem. However, another guest is Inspector MacKenzie incognito, who strongly suspects Raffles of being the Cracksman. Raffles plots to frame a petty criminal with the theft, but keep the jewelry for himself.There are several differences from Hornung's short stories. The plot takes inspiration from the 1898 short story "Gentlemen and Players," in its inclusion of Inspector Mackenzie, a country house setting, and the centrality of a necklace theft. Bunny Manders, described as an only child in the series, has a sister named Gwen, who is Raffles' love interest.The 1939 movie was based heavily on the 1930 film Raffles starring Ronald Colman, which was reported at the time as part of a larger strategy to remake Colman films starring Niven.[1]Sidney Howard was given credit as co-author of the screenplay with John Van Druten, due to his having been the writer of the 1930 version.[2] Howard had died four months prior to the release of this film. F. Scott Fitzgerald may also have worked on the script, but this is unconfirmed.[3]Olivia de Havilland, under contract with Warner Brothers at the time, was "lent" to Goldwyn for the film in April 1939.[4][5]As World War II began during filming, and Niven was a British citizen, it was rumored that the project would have to be suspended if Niven were called up for the army.[6][7] Due to an accelerated schedule, by October 1939, filming had been completed and Niven left for England.[8][9] It was rumored that there would be a sequel if Niven returned from England, but this film was not made.[10]"
Landulf II (archbishop of Benevento);"Landulf II (died 4 August 1119) was the Archbishop of Benevento from 8 November 1108 to his death. He succeeded Roffredo more than a year after the latter's death on 9 September 1107. The main source for his eventful reign is the contemporary chronicler and fellow Lombard and Benventan Falco.Landulf was a son of Gaideris, probably of local origin. Landulf was the cardinal-priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina when he was elected archbishop. He was consecrated to his office by Pope Paschal II himself during a synod in Benevento lasting from October to November 1108. He was a reformer and he directed his energies towards restructuring his ancient diocese, which corresponded roughly to the Principality of Benevento, which was technically papal property. In 1112, he played an essential rôle in the selection of rector for the territory.Despite these characteristics, Landulf was a supporter of the popular party and the Normans and opponent of the pro-papal aristocracy, led by the papal constable Landulf of Greca. A great many feudi (vassals) of the archdiocese were Normans. Discord, however, reached such a level between the two Landulfs that the constable was forced to flee to Montefusco and the archbishop went to Rome in 1114 to seek mediation. The pope responded by sending a Romuald, cardinal-deacon of Santa Maria in Via Lata, and Peter, cardinal-bishop of Porto, to arbitrate between the disputants. Landulf, moreover, had made peace with Robert I of Capua and Jordan of Ariano, who had attacked the city. The pope accused Landulf of exceeding his authority by making truces without papal permission. Romuald found the archbishop to blame for the conflict with Greca and the pope deposed him from his see at the Council of Ceprano in October that year. An eyewitness account of this is probably found in Falco.The Abbey of Montecassino intervened on Landulf's behalf with the pope and, on 11 August 1116, he was reappointed. On 10 March 1118, he was in Gaeta to greet Pope Gelasius II in his exile. On 10 March 1119, he convoked a local synod to put an end to the ongoing violence. Attended by many cardinals and bishops,[1] the council provided little help to the situation.Landulf was a promoter of local hagiography and cults. He also built a new episcopal cathedral and translated the bodies of the saints kept at the old one there on 15 May.[2] He died 4 August 1119, leaving us some sermons, hagiographies, and a passion. "
William H. Crawford;"William Harris Crawford (February 24, 1772 – September 15, 1834) was an American politician and judge during the early 19th century. He served as US Secretary of War and US Secretary of the Treasury before he ran for US president in the 1824 election.Born in Virginia, Crawford moved to Georgia at a young age. After studying law, Crawford won election to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1803. He aligned with the Democratic-Republican Party and US Senator James Jackson. In 1807, the Georgia legislature elected Crawford to the US Senate. After the death of US Vice President George Clinton, Crawford's position as president pro tempore of the US Senate made him first in the presidential line of succession from April 1812 to March 1813. In 1813, US President James Madison appointed Crawford as the minister to France, and Crawford held that post for the remainder of the War of 1812. After the war, Madison appointed him to the position of Secretary of War. In October 1816, Madison chose Crawford for the position of Secretary of the Treasury, and Crawford would remain in that office for the remainder of Madison's presidency and for the duration of James Monroe's presidency.Although Crawford suffered a severe stroke in 1823, he sought to succeed Monroe at the 1824 election. Crawford received the support of the Virginia dynasty, but ongoing concerns about his health along with a changing political landscape made it impossible for him to become the fourth consecutive Virginian to hold the office of president. The Democratic-Republican Party splintered into factions, as several others also sought the presidency. No candidate won a majority of the electoral vote and so the US House of Representatives chose the president in a contingent election. Under the terms of the US Constitution, the House selected from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, which left Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and Crawford in the running. The House selected Adams, who asked Crawford to remain as Treasury Secretary. Declining Adams's offer, Crawford returned to Georgia and accepted an appointment to the state superior court.Crawford considered running in the 1832 presidential election for the presidency or the vice presidency but ultimately chose not to when fellow southerner Andrew Jackson sought a second term.Crawford was born on February 24, 1772, in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia, that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County.[1] He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina, in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia, in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.He influenced Georgia politics for decades.[2] In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist was shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.[3]In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th Congress as the junior U.S. senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.Crawford was elected President pro tempore of the Senate in March 1812 and, following the April 20, 1812, death of Vice President George Clinton, served as the permanent Presiding Officer of the Senate until March 4, 1813.In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812 and supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:[4] "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."[5]Throughout his service in the Senate, Crawford was described as a member of the older more traditional wing of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he often focused on issues such as states' rights, which he supported.[6]In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the US minister to France during the waning years of Napoleon's First French Empire. Crawford served until 1815, shortly after the end of the Napoleonic Wars.[7]Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War on 1 August 1815. Crawford served more than a year in that post. He sought but narrowly failed to win the Democratic-Republican nomination for the 1816 presidential race. Madison appointed him Treasury Secretary on 22 October 1816. He remained in that post for the rest of Madison's term and both terms of President James Monroe, until 6 March 1825.The Congressional Caucus nominated Crawford for the 1824 election. However, Crawford had suffered a stroke in 1823 as a result of a prescription given to him by his physician.[8] The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.  Despite improved health and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson, he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Senator and General Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans, and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams.  In the subsequent contingent election, the House elected Adams President.Refusing Adams's request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.[9]Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.[10]Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.Crawford was a descendant of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643 but participated and died in Bacon's Rebellion. John's son David Crawford I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford III (1697–1766). David Crawford III married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).His cousin George W. Crawford served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.In 1875, Crawford appeared on the 50 cent bill.The following places are named in his honor:[11]"

Hybrid seed;"In agriculture and gardening, hybrid seed is produced by  cross-pollinated plants. Hybrid seed production is predominant in modern agriculture and home gardening. It is one of the main contributors to the dramatic rise in agricultural output during the last half of the 20th century.[1] The alternatives to hybridization are open pollination and clonal propagation.[2]All of the hybrid seeds planted by the farmer will produce similar plants, while the seeds of the next generation from those hybrids will not consistently have the desired characteristics. Controlled hybrids provide very uniform characteristics because they are produced by crossing two inbred strains. Elite inbred strains are used that express well-documented and consistent phenotypes (such as high crop yield) that are relatively good for inbred plants.[2]Hybrids are chosen to improve the characteristics of the resulting plants, such as better yield, greater uniformity, improved color, disease resistance.An important factor is the heterosis or combining ability of the parent plants. Crossing any particular pair of inbred strains may or may not result in superior offspring. The parent strains used are therefore carefully chosen so as to achieve the uniformity that comes from the uniformity of the parents, and the superior performance that comes from heterosis.[3]In the US, experimental agriculture stations in the 1920s investigated the hybrid crops, and by the 1930s farmers had widely adopted the first hybrid maize.[4]"

The result was a victory for Indian National Congress winning 24 out of 34 seats. The major opposition for INC, the CPI, managed to only win 2 seats.  This election also saw the entry of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in their first national election, who ended up winning 2 seats. Due to the nonrecognition of state parties such as the DMK, they were grouped under independent parties, which won a total of 8 seats."
Marcian of Tortona;"Saint Marcian (Marciano, Marziano, Marcianus) of Tortona (died 117 or 120 AD) is a saint of Roman Catholic church. He is traditionally said to have been the first bishop of Tortona, in what is now north-western Italy, a post he held for forty-five years.Tradition states that he was born to a pagan family but was converted by Saint Barnabas and then confirmed in the Christian faith by Saint Sirus (Siro), bishop of Pavia.  Saint Secundus of Asti is said to have met Marcian at Tortona, when the former was still a pagan.  Secundus' meeting with Marcian influenced his decision to become a Christian.[1]  He is said to have been crucified for his Christianity.There is some disagreement about the year of his death. Some sources say it occurred in 117, under Trajan, while others say it was under Hadrian in 120.Some people have argued that he is the same person as Marcian of Ravenna.  Documents from the eighth century attest to his episcopate.  Walafrid Strabo, in response to the construction of a church in honor of the saint, indicates that Marcian was the first bishop of the Tortonese community and a martyr.[2]  His relics, found on the left bank of the Scrivia in the fourth century by Saint Innocent (Innocenzo), bishop of Brescia, can now be found in the cathedral of Tortona.  A finger bone associated with the saint has been kept at Genola, of which he is also patron.[3]He is the patron saint of Tortona.  His feast day is March 6."

Dechmont Law;"Disambiguation: the name Dechmont, and an associated "Dechmont Hill" are also places near Cambuslang in ScotlandDechmont Law is a hill in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland. It lies around 700 yards southwest of the village of Dechmont, which provides its name. It is known locally as "Decky Hill" or as "Dechmont Hill" (Law is Lowland Scots for "hill"). "Deer Hill" is another peak of the same hill, to the northeast of the main peak.It is the highest hill in the Livingston area, and Arthur's Seat and the Pentland Hills can be seen from here, as well as a view down the Almond valley.Dechmont Law is a volcanic plug.The slopes show signs of agricultural terracing, from the Bronze and Iron Age, but it is unclear whether it was ever a hillfort. Its strategic position makes this likely, but there is insufficient archaeological evidence.In 1979, forestry worker Bob Taylor had an alleged encounter with a UFO in the area of Dechmont Law.In 2005, the body of 11 year old Rory Blackhall was found under an old, upside-down, two-person tent in woodland west of Dechmont Law. Rory's body was discovered after a methodical two hour search by a Countryside Ranger who knew the area well. Two mountain rescue members and a rescue dog, searching independently, were at the same spot a few minutes later. The Ranger helped the police to secure the area. The case has since closed, the murder suspect having committed suicide.[1]Coordinates: 55°54′38″N 3°32′55″W﻿ / ﻿55.91065°N 3.54851°W﻿ / 55.91065, -3.54851"

Johnson and Roderic R. Richardson.Originally conceived as a digital effects and coding atelier and center for youth education, Eyebeam has become a center for the research, development, and curation of new media works of art and open source technology. Eyebeam annually hosts up to 20 residents and co-produces youth educational programs, exhibitions, performances, symposia, workshops, hackathons and other events with these residents as well as with partner organizations.[1] Projects developed at Eyebeam have received awards and recognition including Webby Awards, Guggenheim Fellowships, and the Prix Ars Electronica.[citation needed]Eyebeam, originally called Eyebeam Atelier, was first conceived as a collaboration between David S. Johnson, a digital artist, and John Seward Johnson III, a filmmaker and philanthropist.  The two were introduced by Roderic R. Richardson, a mutual friend who recognized their shared interests and helped establish the new venture in its early stages.  The inspiration to name the project Eyebeam Atelier came partly from the sculpture atelier of John Johnson's father, John Seward Johnson II and the Experiments in Art and Technology collective, although David Johnson had also used the name Eyebeam Simulations for a start-up location-based VR entertainment concept before meeting Roderic or John Johnson.  After observing new media as a growing genre, the co-founders were motivated to create a similar studio. They recognized a need to provide artists and digital film artists access to new technology and a shared workspace.[2]In addition to offering resources for new media artists, Johnson saw a need to provide middle and high school students with educational and artistic opportunities.[3] Digital Day Camp, the first youth program which catered to new media education, was founded in 1998, in the pilot program, New York-based high school students learned web development and design.[4] Future sessions included project-based learning around themes of bioart, urban interventionism, game design, and wearable technology.Eyebeam's first forum, "Interaction", took place online in the summer of 1998 and was curated by UCSD professor Jordan Crandall. The forum, an email list called <eyebeam><blast>, was hosted by Brian Holmes, Olu Oguibe, and Gregory Ulmer, and included Lev Manovich, N. Katherine Hayles, Saskia Sassen, Matthew Slotover, Ken Goldberg, Geert Lovink, Knowbotic Research, Hans-Ulrich Obrist, Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger, Mark Tribe, and Critical Art Ensemble among the participating  artists, educators, new media and internet theorists, and technologists (cite). The discussions spurred by <eyebeam><blast> were compiled into a book titled Interaction: Artistic Practice on the Network and published in 2001.[5]In addition to funding artistic research, Johnson hoped to develop Eyebeam as a space that would also function as a museum devoted to new media works.[6] In 2000, Eyebeam announced an international architectural competition to construct a space devoted to the dialog between art and technology, with the design firm Diller + Scofidio's "Olympic class" design named the winner of the competition.[7]Eyebeam held its first open studios for artists in residence and fellows in 2002. Alexander R. Galloway, G. H. Hovagimyan, Tony Martin, Yael Kanarek, MTAA, John Klima, Jem Cohen, Cory Arcangel, and Michael Bell-Smith were among the inaugural exhibitors.[citation needed] Among the projects on display was Galloway's Carnivore,[8] a Processing library that allowed for the creative misuse of data surveillance created in tandem with other members of Radical Software Group.[9][10] Carnivore takes its name and function from DCS1000, a surveillance system used by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. Carnivore was awarded the Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica the same year.[citation needed]Residents Yury Gitman and Carlos Gomez de Llarena's Noderunner,[11] a scavenger hunt based on Wi-Fi sharing, received the 2003 Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica.[citation needed] Fundrace.org, a site which allows visitors to track campaign contributions through geocoding, was developed by Jonah Peretti, then-director of Research and Development at Eyebeam, and later adapted into a permanent feature on the Huffington Post.[12] Peretti, together with Alexander Galloway, collaborated on ReBlog,[13] one of the first blogging platform which allows users to filter and publish content from many RSS feeds. Beginning in 2005, the Eyebeam ReBlog began to feature the Eyebeam Journal,[14] a series of in-depth writings and interviews with resident artists, research fellows, and guest contributors. During their R&D Fellowships, Theo Watson and Zachary Lieberman continued to develop openFrameworks, a C/C++ library originally created at Parsons. Together with Processing, openFrameworks became one of the most popular platforms for creative coding.[15]The Eyebeam OpenLab served as the birthplace of the Graffiti Research Lab. Founded by James Powderly and Evan Roth during their OpenLab fellowships in 2005, the GRL was envisioned as a nonprofit design studio for creating experimental technologies with street art applications.[16] While at Eyebeam, Powderly and Roth developed a method for creating graffiti messages in individual LED lights and a system for projecting shapes drawn with a handheld laser in real time.[17] Powderly and Roth later founded the F.A.T. (Free Art and Technology) Lab, a collective dedicated to the merging of open source technology and popular culture, with Theo Watson, Chris Sugrue, and others.[18]Eyebeam expanded its programmatic lineup of exhibitions and workshops with MIXER, a series dedicated to showcasing leading performance artists in the field of live video and audio, in late 2007.[19] The inaugural event, "Brother Islands (Places to Lose People)", was focused around an immersive experimental documentary of North Brother Island and Wards Island by media artist Benton C Bainbridge. MIXER events were organized around themes as disparate as the World's Fair, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and New York City's underground and featured interactive installations alongside performances by musicians and performance artists including DāM-FunK, Extreme Animals, CHERYL, and D-Fuse AV. That same year, fellows and resident artists began organizing mobile workshops and talks. In 2011, several Eyebeam residents, fellows, and alumni participated in Talk to Me: Design and the Communication between People and Objects at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Eyebeam Fellow Ayah Bdeir's littleBits, a DIY kit of open source pre-assembled circuits, was among the projects displayed and was acquired by the MoMA as part of their permanent collection.[20]In February 2014 the first ever Art + Feminism Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon was hosted at Eyebeam and co-organized by fellow Laurel Ptak in conjunction with more than 30 satellite edit-a-thons internationally across the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.Since November 2017 Eyebeam has been located at 199 Cook Street in Brooklyn.

Predictive maintenance;"Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to estimate when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted. Thus, it is regarded as condition-based maintenance carried out as suggested by estimations of the degradation state of an item.[1][2]The main promise of predictive maintenance is to allow convenient scheduling of corrective maintenance, and to prevent unexpected equipment failures. The key is "the right infor equipment lifetime, increased plant safety, fewer accidents with negative impact on environment, and optimized spare parts handling.Predictive maintenance differs from preventive maintenance because it relies on the actual condition of equipment, rather than average or expected life statistics, to predict when maintenance will be required. Typically, Machine Learning approaches are adopted for the definition of the actual condition of the system and for forecasting its future states.[3]Some of the main components that are necessary for implementing predictive maintenance are data collection and preprocessing, early fault detection, fault detection, time to failure prediction, maintenance scheduling and resource optimization.[4] Predictive maintenance has also been considered to be one of the driving forces for improving productivity and one of the ways to achieve "just-in-time" in manufacturing.[5]Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing periodic (offline) or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The ultimate goal of the approach is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. This results in a reduction in unplanned downtime costs because of failure, where costs can be in the hundreds of thousands per day depending on industry.[6] In energy production, in addition to loss of revenue and component costs, fines can be levied for non-delivery, increasing costs even further. This is in contrast to time- and/or operation count-based maintenance, where a piece of equipment gets maintained whether it needs it or not. Time-based maintenance is labor intensive, ineffective in identifying problems that develop between scheduled inspections, and therefore is not cost-effective.The "predictive" component of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate.Most predictive inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Adoption of predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability.Reliability-centered maintenance emphasizes the use of predictive maintenance techniques in addition to traditional preventive measures. When properly implemented, it provides companies with a tool for achieving lowest asset net present costs for a given level of performance and risk.[7]One goal is to transfer the predictive maintenance data to a computerized maintenance management system so that the equipment condition data is sent to the right equipment object to trigger maintenance planning, work order execution, and reporting.[8] Unless this is achieved, the predictive maintenance solution is of limited value, at least if the solution is implemented on a medium to large size plant with tens of thousands pieces of equipment. In 2010, the mining company Boliden, implemented a combined Distributed Control System and predictive maintenance solution integrated with the plant computerized maintenance management system on an object to object level, transferring equipment data using protocols like Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol, IEC61850 and OLE for process control.To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests. A new approach in this area is to utilize measurements on the actual equipment in combination with measurement of process performance, measured by other devices, to trigger equipment maintenance. This is primarily available in collaborative process automation systems (CPAS).  Site measurements are often supported by wireless sensor networks to reduce the wiring cost.Vibration analysis is most productive on high-speed rotating equipment and can be the most expensive component of a PdM program to get up and running. Vibration analysis, when properly done, allows the user to evaluate the condition of equipment and avoid failures. The latest generation of vibration analyzers comprises more capabilities and automated functions than its predecessors. Many units display the full vibration spectrum of three axes simultaneously, providing a snapshot of what is going on with a particular machine. But despite such capabilities, not even the most sophisticated equipment successfully predicts developing problems unless the operator understands and applies the basics of vibration analysis.[9]In certain situations, strong background noise interferences from several competing sources may mask the signal of interest and hinder the industrial applicability of vibration sensors. Consequently, motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is a non-intrusive alternative to vibration measurement which has the potential to monitor faults from both electrical and mechanical systems.Remote visual inspection is the first non-destructive testing. It provides a cost-efficient primary assessment. Essential information and defaults can be deduced from the external appearance of the piece, such as folds, breaks, cracks, and corrosion. The remote visual inspection has to be carried out in good conditions with a sufficient lighting (350 LUX at least). When the part of the piece to be controlled is not directly accessible, an instrument made of mirrors and lenses called endoscope is used. Hidden defects with external irregularities may indicate a more serious defect inside.[citation needed]Acoustical analysis can be done on a sonic or ultrasonic level. New ultrasonic techniques for condition monitoring make it possible to "hear" friction and stress in rotating machinery, which can predict deterioration earlier than conventional techniques.[10] Ultrasonic technology is sensitive to high-frequency sounds that are inaudible to the human ear and distinguishes them from lower-frequency sounds and mechanical vibration. Machine friction and stress waves produce distinctive sounds in the upper ultrasonic range.Changes in these friction and stress waves can suggest deteriorating conditions much earlier than technologies such as vibration or oil analysis. With proper ultrasonic measurement and analysis, it's possible to differentiate normal wear from abnormal wear, physical damage, imbalance conditions, and lubrication problems based on a direct relationship between asset and operating conditions.Sonic monitoring equipment is less expensive, but it also has fewer uses than ultrasonic technologies. Sonic technology is useful only on mechanical equipment, while ultrasonic equipment can detect electrical problems and is more flexible and reliable in detecting mechanical problems.Infrared monitoring and analysis has the widest range of application (from high- to low-speed equipment), and it can be effective for spotting both mechanical and electrical failures, some consider it to currently be the most cost-effective technology. Oil analysis is a long-term program that, where relevant, can eventually be more predictive than any of the other technologies. It can take years for a plant's oil program to reach this level of sophistication and effectiveness. Analytical techniques performed on oil samples can be classified in two categories: used oil analysis and wear particle analysis. Used oil analysis determines the condition of the lubricant itself, determines the quality of the lubricant, and checks its suitability for continued use. Wear particle analysis determines the mechanical condition of machine components that are lubricated. Through wear particle analysis, you can identify the composition of the solid material present and evaluate particle type, size, concentration, distribution, and morphology.[11]The use of Model Based Condition Monitoring for predictive maintenance programs is becoming increasingly popular over time.  This method involves spectral analysis on the motor's current and voltage signals and then compares the measured parameters to a known and learned model of the motor to diagnose various electrical and mechanical anomalies.  This process of "model based" condition monitoring was originally designed and used on NASA's space shuttle to monitor and detect developing faults in the space shuttle's main engine.[12] It allows for the automation of data collection and analysis tasks, providing round the clock condition monitoring and warnings about faults as they develop. Other predictive maintenance methods are related to smart testing strategies.[13][16]"

Festliches Nürnberg;"Festliches Nürnberg (English: Festive Nuremberg) is a short 1937 propaganda film chronicling the Nazi Party rallies in Nuremberg, Germany in 1936 and 1937. The film was directed by Hans Weidemann.[1]The film runs in colour for only 21 minutes (the downloadable version at the Internet archive is monochrome only and has no English translation of the little commentary that exists), containing footage of the 8th and 9th Nuremberg Rallies. Particularly notable scenes of both the rally and the film are images of Albert Speer's lighting techniques during the 9th Nuremberg rally on 10 September 1937, in which he positioned 134 searchlights circling the Zeppelin field on which the rally was taking place. The beams of these spotlights, forming the "cathedral of light", merged into the general glow at an estimated height of 20,000 feet, and would be used for more practical purposes after war was declared in 1939.The film is relatively short at only about 21 minutes compared with the longer Triumph des Willens and Der Sieg des Glaubens made by Leni Riefenstahl in 1934 and 1933 respectively. It adopts the same heavy style of adoration of Hitler with many scenes of marching SS men and Wehrmacht soldiers as well as navy personnel and flying aircraft overhead. With some prescience, scenes of soldiers parading in tanks and other vehicles (with guns firing) assume great prominence. The film concludes with sequences of folk dances and gymnastic displays, followed by a torchlight parade and a brief speech from Hitler.Since the formation of the Nazi Party in 1923, annual rallies had taken place at Nuremberg, mainly orchestrated by the Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. The Nazi party also called upon architect Albert Speer to create a number of spectacles to inspire the German population. The 8th and 9th of these rallies were known as the "Rally of Honor" (Reichsparteitag der Ehre) and the "Rally of Labor" (Reichsparteitag der Arbeit) respectively for 1937 and 1938. The rally for 1939 would be known as the "Rally for Peace" but was postponed indefinitely as war approached in September 1939.The film followed the much longer Riefenstahl films of 1933 and 1934 and the reason for the smaller movie is not known. Many of the film sequences follow Riefenstahl quite closely, such as the introduction using aerial shots of the city of Nuremberg. The score uses Richard Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg for musical accompaniment."

Presbyter Judaeorum;"The Presbyter Judaeorum was the chief official of the Jews of England prior to the Edict of Expulsion. The office appears to have been for life, though in two or three instances the incumbent either resigned or was dismissed. Prynne[1] argues that the Presbyter Judaeorum was merely a secular officer in the Exchequer of the Jews to keep the rolls of control, whereas Tovey[2] argues that the use of "sacerdos" and "pontifex" as synonymous of the office shows its ecclesiastical character.There were only six of them between 1199 and 1290, the first known being Jacob of London, appointed in 1199, the next were Josce of London (1217–1237), Aaron of York (1237), Elias le Evesque (1237), Hagin fil Mosse (1257), and Hagin fil Deulacres (1281, appointed by the favour of Eleanor of Provence[3]).In the grant of Elias le Evesque, the justices of the Jews were ordered not to issue any summons without the confirmation of the said Elias, from which it appears that the presbyter acted somewhat as a baron of the Jewish Exchequer, and it was distinctly stated that Hagin fil Mosse had been sworn into the Jewish Exchequer to look after the administration of justice on behalf of the king and to explain the king's laws. It is thus probable that the presbyter was a successor of the Jewish justices, of whom two are mentioned toward the end of the twelfth century. This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Singer, Isidore,  et al., eds.

Stord/Haugesund University College;"Stord/Haugesund University College (HSH), Norwegian: Høgskolen Stord/Haugesund) was a medium sized state university college in Norway before it was merged with Bergen University College and Sogn og Fjordane University College to become HVL. The university college offered bachelor's and master's degrees in various fields (including information and communication technology, safety management, health sciences, and marine studies) and courses for professionals. The university college also had several PhD students working in various disciplines. The institution did not have the power to award doctoral degrees which must be awarded by an external institution.The university college was established in 1994 when the Norwegian college system was restructured and Haugesund Sjukepleierhøgskole (Haugesund Nursing College), Stord Lærarhøgskule (Stord Teachers College) and Stord Sjukepleiarhøgskule (Stord Nursing College) merged. As a result, there were campuses both in Haugesund and on Stord which both have now merged into HVL. The largest campus was located in Haugesund however as the administration is based in Stord, the Stord campus appears first in the name of the institution. Now the largest campus is located in Bergen.While HSH was formed fairly recently, the history of the founding institutions dates back to 1839 when teachers were educated on Stord. HSH in Haugesund dates back to 1985 when maritime education was offered.[1] The development of HSH continues. Since 2008, HSH has been a partner in UH-nett Vest[2] (Universitets- og høgskolenettet på Vestlandet). This organisation attempts to foster greater cooperation between the participating institutions.As well as teaching, HSH also has a significant research output. In 2008, HSH recorded 53 publication points,[3] a 49% increase on 2007.Coordinates: 59°24′33″N 5°16′35″E﻿ / ﻿59.4092°N 5.2764°E﻿ / 59.4092, 5.2764"

Di-deuterated linoleic acid ethyl ester;"Di-deuterated ethyl linoleate (also known as RT001, di-deuterated linoleic acid ethyl ester, 11,11-d2-ethyl linoleate, or ethyl 11,11-d2-linoleate)[1] is an experimental, orally-bioavailable synthetic deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), a part of reinforced lipids.  It is an isotopologue of linoleic acid, an essential omega-6 PUFA. The deuterated compound, while identical to natural linoleic acid except for the presence of deuterium, is resistant to lipid peroxidation which makes studies of its cell-protective properties worthwhile.Di-deuterated linoleic acid is recognized by cells as identical to the natural linoleic acid. But when taken up, it is converted into 13,13-d2-arachidonic acid, a heavy isotope version of arachidonic acid, that gets incorporated into lipid membranes. The deuterated compound resists the non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) through isotope effect — a non-antioxidant based mechanism that protects mitochondrial, neuronal and other lipid membranes, thereby greatly reducing the levels of numerous LPO-derived toxic products such as reactive carbonyls.[2][3]A double-blind comparator-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial for Friedreich's ataxia, sponsored by Retrotope and Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, was conducted to determine the safety profile and appropriate dosing for consequent trials.[4] RT001 was promptly absorbed and was found to be safe and tolerable over 28 days at the maximal dose of 9 g/day. It improved peak workload and peak oxygen consumption in the test group compared to the control group who received the equal doses of normal, non-deuterated ethyl linoleate.[5] Another randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study began in 2019.[6]An open-label clinical study for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy evaluating long-term evaluation of efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RT001, which, when taken with food, can protect the neuronal cells from degeneration, started in the Summer 2018.[7]In 2017, the FDA granted RT001 orphan drug designation in the treatment of phospholipase 2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN).[8]In 2018, RT001 was given to a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) under a "compassionate use scheme".[9]In 2020, the FDA granted orphan drug designation RT001 for the treatment of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). PSP is a disease involving modification and dysfunction of tau protein, RT001’s mechanism of action both lowers lipid peroxidation and prevents mitochondrial cell death of neurons which is associated with disease onset and progression.[10]RT001 has been shown to be effective in a model of Alzheimer's disease in mice.[11]"

KaBlam!;"KaBlam! (stylized as KaBLaM!) is an American animated sketch comedy television series that ran on Nickelodeon from 1996 to 2000.[4] The series was created by Robert Mittenthal, Will McRobb, and Chris Viscardi. The show was developed as a fully animated showcase for alternative forms of animation that were more common in indie films and commercials.[5] Each episode thus features a collection of short films in different innovative styles of animation, bridged by the characters Henry and June, who introduce the short animations and have adventures of their own in between.[6]Although SNICK aired many Nicktoons not part of its block, KaBlam! was the only Nicktoon created for SNICK. The show became TV-Y in 1997 (when the U.S. content ratings were put to use), until later that year when the rating was changed to TV-Y7 due to the U.S. content ratings having accidentally rated the show TV-Y by mistake.[citation needed] The show was a critical and commercial success.[citation needed]The show was last aired as a part of Nickelodeon's 'The Splat' programming block on October 8 and 9, 2016.[7]The segment creators include David Fain, Tim Hill, Steve Holman, Emily Hubley, Mark Marek, Mike Pearlstein, Mo Willems, and Cote Zellers.[5] The theme song and all of the original background music on the show was provided by the Moon Ska Stompers, a band that consists of King Django, Victor Rice, and members of The Toasters and The New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble. The bulk of the soundtrack was 30-second instrumental clips of songs from The Toasters' album D.L.T.B.G.Y.D., while the theme song itself is a shortened version of the Toasters song "2-Tone Army". Tracks from the Associated Production Music library were also utilized.KaBlam! was the first show to be spun off of All That. It was pitched to Nickelodeon in 1994 and aired two years later. The pilot episode, "Your Real Best Friend", was created in 1995 and finished in 1996[citation needed]. One of the shorts, Mo Willems's The Off-Beats was initially produced as standalone short films for Nickelodeon, but after it was nominated for a cable ACE award, more segments were produced for KaBlam![8]The show began production in 1995 and premiered on October 11, 1996. The show ran for four seasons, totaling 48 episodes. The final episode was broadcast on January 22, 2000.In 2010, Mark Marek, who created the Henry and June shorts, co-created the Warner Bros. Animation-produced cartoon, MAD. Julia McIlvaine, who voiced June, has appeared in a few episodes.The first season began with regular cartoons in their regular order. Sniz & Fondue, Action League Now!, Prometheus and Bob, and Life with Loopy. The Off-Beats was also another regular cartoon that occasionally filled in for "Life with Loopy" or Prometheus and Bob. Other cartoons such as Surprising Shorts, Lava!, Angela Anaconda, and once, The Louie and Louie Show aired. This is the only season in which a Sniz & Fondue short is included in every episode. Henry and June frequently had random short plots when the screen was shown on them and barely had one main plot, unlike future episodes. They had one whole plot in Comics for Tomorrow Today and What the Astronauts Drink. The opening animation starts out with a hawk crashing into the camera while the camera pans through a forest, dives underwater and travels to Egypt where Egyptians dance and the Great Sphinx swipes at the camera. The camera then heads to outer space showing two kids in a ride, the planets, stars, asteroids, and flying saucers. After the United States Capitol is destroyed by two saucers, it then pans to Godzilla destroying a city. It then pans to an open street comic book store and lands on the KaBlam! comic book, featuring the Flesh, Stinky Diver, Sniz, Fondue, and Loopy on it. The book is then opened by Henry and June. After they dance, the episode starts. At the start of the theme, a voiceover of a man shouts "Wake up the masses!". As soon as he finishes, another man (Bert Pence) continues by saying, "Assume the crash position. Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a new kind of cartoon show. It's KaBlam! Where cartoons and comics collide. Now to take you inside and turn the pages, here are your hosts, Henry and June." The ending theme for most of the first season is Toasters song Skaternity (performed by the 'Moon Ska Stompers').After seven more episodes of The Off-Beats, and one last episode of Surprising Shorts, they were officially taken out of KaBlam! One-time shorts were brought in such as Randall Flan's Incredible Big Top, The Girl with Her Head Coming Off, and The Adventures of Patchhead which did return in season 3. The Brothers Tiki appeared twice in season 2. Henry and June are now drawn differently and their voices are deeper. The opening theme to the show is barely changed. When the camera pans on the KaBlam! comic book, it is clearly seen that the cover is different. In place of the original characters, Thundergirl, Stinky Diver, Prometheus, Bob, Loopy, Sniz, and Fondue are seen. Also, Henry and June dance the macarena and then arm-in-arm, whereas in season one, it was just a bunch of random dances. The ending theme to the show is dramatically changed. Instead of Skaternity, it is "Everything You Said Has Been a Lie" by The Toasters (also performed by the 'Moon Ska Stompers'). After this season, the rating for KaBlam! went up from TV-Y to TV-Y7 for the remainder of the show's run.This season featured the last four episodes of Sniz & Fondue. JetCat and Race Rabbit are introduced and become minor shorts that appeared from time to time. The Adventures of Patchhead makes its second and final appearance. A music video for a song by James Kochalka called "Hockey Monkey" also appears once. Henry and June are drawn a little differently and their voices are slightly deeper. The opening theme is shortened and Henry and June have their own main plots now. In the episode "You May Already Be a...KaBlammer!", Lou Rawls is featured and voiced by the actual provider. The opening theme had a number of changes. After the camera comes up out of the water, it goes directly to the White House scene. After the Godzilla scene, the camera pans toward a school rather than the comic book stand. As it enters the classroom, the camera scares off a bird that was perched on a window. The camera pans by a teacher and through a number of students. It stops as it hits a student reading a KaBlam! comic book. On the cover of the comic book, it shows a child who is ecstatic. Henry and June then open the comic book, dance, and the episode starts. The announcer's line as he introduces the show is slightly changed. Instead of saying "Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a new kind of cartoon show", he says "Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a cartoon cramaganza!" The ending theme is not changed. This was also intended to be the final season until Nickelodeon renewed the show.All the shorts (except Action League Now! and Angela Anaconda, which both spun off into their own shows) come to an end in the final season. Life with Loopy and Prometheus and Bob air their last seven episodes while JetCat and Race Rabbit air their last one and three episodes, respectively. Music videos by They Might Be Giants appear twice, they were Why Does the Sun Shine? and Doctor Worm. One-time cartoons still appear: Fuzzball, Garbage Boy, Emmett Freedy, Stewy the Dog Boy, The Little Freaks, and The Shizzagee. One-time shorts are included in nearly every episode, excluding "A Nut in Every Bite!", "The KaBlair! Witch Project", and "Now With More Flava'". In every episode, Henry and June have their own main plot. In the episode "Sasquatch-ercise", Richard Simmons is featured and in the episode "Now With More Flava'", John Stamos and Busta Rhymes are featured, however, the stars did not voice their characters. The opening and ending themes are unchanged.Some of these shorts air more frequently and consistently than others.The animated hosts of KaBlam! who turn the pages of a comic book (changes with each episode) to reveal the next cartoon or alternative animation, as well as being involved in subplots of their own between the shorts. These shorts were directed by Mark Marek. Began: Season 1 Ended: Season 3A pair of ferret roommates who often get on each other's nerves. Sniz is the younger kid ferret that is very hyperactive, and quite a troublemaker of the duo, while Fondue is the older teenage ferret, who is the nervous, yet intelligent one. There is also Snuppa and Bianca, Sniz and Fondue's roommates. From mid-1997 (around KaBlam's second season) until Sniz and Fondue ended production in late 1998 (around KaBlam!s third or fourth season).  Due to its production company going to work on a television adaptation of Watership Down as well as creator Michael Pearlstein leaving the show out of frustration, Sniz & Fondue was taken off of the KaBlam! roster after season 3, although it still appeared in the intro. The show was created by Michael Pearlstein. The pilot "Psyched for Snuppa" was produced in 1992 by Stretch Films and Jumbo Pictures, and was directed by John R. Dilworth, creator of Cartoon Network's Courage the Cowardly Dog. Unfortunately, John R. Dilworth, Jim Jinkins, and David Campbell were only involved in the pilot, but later all had no involvement with the rest of Sniz & Fondue when it became a part of KaBlam!. Reasons were that Doug creator Jim Jinkins and David Campbell have officially moved their jobs to Disney when they purchased Jumbo Pictures, and John R. Dilworth would later work on other projects, such as creating Courage the Cowardly Dog for Cartoon Network in 1999. Began: Season 1 Ended: Season 4Filmed in "Chuckimation", in which the characters/props are moved by unseen hands or thrown from off-camera (interspersed with occasional stop motion animation). Action League Now! featured a group of superheroes, played by custom-made action figures, who fight crime in  suburbia despite being total idiots. The four superheroes are The Flesh, Thundergirl, Stinky Diver, and Meltman. Considered to be the most successful KaBlam! short, it briefly became a spin-off series in 2001. Action League Now! is the only short to have a new episode with every showing of KaBlam! and it served as the centerpiece of KaBlam!. All of the characters on the shorts were voiced by personalities from radio station WDVE in Pittsburgh. The show was created by Robert Mittenthal, Will McRobb, and Albie HechtBegan: Season 1, ended: Season 4The life of a preteen boy Larry and his strange experiences with his imaginative and adventurous younger sister Loopy. The characters were animated with stop-motion puppet bodies, but their heads were created with metal and their features were magnetic. The show was created by a British-born Stephen Holman, who previously created Joe Normal for MTV's Liquid Television, and later created Phantom Investigators on Kids' WB.Began: Season 1, ended: Season 4Also known as The Prometheus and Bob Tapes. A stop motion segment featuring the camera-recorded mission logs of Prometheus, an alien who comes to Earth attempting to teach a caveman, Bob, everyday things. From the use of fire to the act of ice skating, the result is usually a failure by the mischievous third cast member, who was a simple monkey. The show was created by Cote Zellers.The introduction, done in a mock government format, describes the events as having occurred "900,000 years ago". Began: Season 1, ended: Season 2A series that centers on a group of unpopular friends and their main rivals, a popular clique known as "The Populars". It originally aired during Nick's commercial breaks as stand-alone shorts to promote the premiere of KaBlam!,[citation needed] and it was also released on a 1996 Rugrats videotape, "Tommy Troubles". The show was created by Mo Willems, who later created Sheep in the Big City for Cartoon Network. The show was taken off the KaBlam! roster after season 2 because Mo Willems wanted to move over to Cartoon Network. However, The Off-Beats officially ended as a whole with a half-hour Valentine's Day special premiering in 1999, which was the last episode of the Off-Beats produced, as Mo Willems finally left Nickelodeon in 1999, and moved to Cartoon Network to create Sheep in the Big City in 2000.There were also various They Might Be Giants music videos for the songs "Why Does the Sun Shine?" and "Doctor Worm". In addition, there was a music video of "Hockey Monkey", created by James Kochalka and performed by The Zambonis. These were a mixture of live-action by Jesse Gordon and different animation styles, all produced and directed at The Ink Tank.A live-action Prometheus and Bob film was announced in 1998 to be directed by Harald Zwart, produced by Amy Heckerling and Twink Caplan and written by Joe Stillman, but was scrapped due to a lack of interest.[9][10] According to Cote Zellers, Chris Farley and David Spade were both considered until the former's death, and much of the script was reused for Gulliver's Travels.[11]Shorts from KaBlam! have appeared at the beginning of theatrical releases. An episode of Action League Now! titled "Rock-A-Big Baby" was shown before the Nickelodeon film Good Burger. Angela Anaconda appeared before Digimon: The Movie.A television special called The Henry & June Show was produced and aired on Nickelodeon in 1999. The first segment, "A Show of Their Own" aired, featured Henry and June with a studio audience and musical guests. The next segment was "Be True to Your School", where Henry and June attend school, and try their best to tackle hard subjects like "How to Look Your Best". It was never shown again after it premiered.A number of blocks were hosted by Henry and June for various Nicktoons including:During the promos, Henry's hair looked slightly different in some shots, along with it being a different shade of green. June's cardigan was cherry-red instead of light red/dark orange, and the dots weren't visible. Also, their eyes were blue and green in every shot, instead of being black or blue (or green) and black.KaBlam! was first premiered on October 11, 1996. The show ran for four seasons, totaling 48 episodes. The final episode was broadcast on May 27, 2000. Reruns continued to air on Nickelodeon until 2001. In 2002, Nicktoons was launched, and the channel began airing reruns of the program, though not all episodes were aired. During commercial breaks, various shorts from the show would play, not including any shorts involving Henry and June or music videos. In August 2005, Nicktoons changed its appearance and schedule, and canceled many shows in the process, including KaBlam!. After the show was canceled, the "KaBlam! Presents:" shorts would continue to be shown, until 2008 when the channel did away with all of their in-between shorts, for more commercial space. The program would only be seen one more time in December 2007 for Nicktoons Network's "100 Greatest Nicktoon Episodes" marathon although it was never shown when Nick had a marathon of the first episodes of each Nicktoon on Thanksgiving Day 2007, despite having Henry and June on the cover of the now-defunct Nickelodeon Magazine, it has also been removed from Nickelodeon's 1990s-oriented block for five years. The show would not rerun until October 8–9, 2016 when The Splat would spotlight the show.Internationally, a French-language dub has been broadcast in France on television channel Game One (see Télévision Par Satellite), and other dubs of the show are on other Nickelodeon channels around Europe. It also was shown in the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2000. In Poland, it aired from 1999 to 2001 on Fantastic. The show was aired in Estonia as well. The show is aired on YTV in Canada.[citation needed]The show has only one episode "Won’t Crack or Peel" (3D broadcast version) that was ever released on VHS, as part of a promotion with Tombstone Pizza. There is no DVD release. Additionally, the show would not be included on a streaming service until VRV added KaBlam! on August 28, 2018.[12] As of June 2021, select episodes of KaBlam! have been made available to stream on Paramount+.[13] and on Amazon Prime Video through a Paramount+ subscription."
Capital punishment in Maryland;"Capital punishment was abolished via the legislative process on May 2, 2013, in the U.S. state of Maryland.[1]The death penalty had been in use in the state or, more precisely, its predecessor colony since June 20, 1638, when two men were hanged for piracy in St. Mary's County. A total of 309 people were executed by a variety of methods from 1638 to June 9, 1961, the last execution before Furman v. Georgia. Since that time, five people have been executed.The "Death Row" for men was in the North Branch Correctional Institution in Western Maryland's Cumberland area. The execution chamber was in the Metropolitan Transition Center (the former Maryland Penitentiary). The five men who were on the State's "death row" were moved in June 2010 from the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center.[2]Up until the second half the 20th century, most executions were by hanging. The exceptions were a soldier shot for desertion, two slaves hanged in chains, and one female slave who was burned at the stake. All hangings were performed in public in the county where the offense took place.In 1809, the Maryland legislature enacted laws that provided for murder in varying degrees. The mandatory punishment for first-degree murder was given as death. New laws came into force in 1908 which allowed the sentencing judge discretion, giving the option of life imprisonment. Then in 1916, the jury was given the option of deciding if they wished to impose the death penalty during their deliberations. They could now return a sentence of guilty "without capital punishment."It was not uncommon for photographers to capture the final moments of a Maryland convict and offer these photos for sale following the execution. For example, on October 20, 1905, John M. Simpers was executed for murdering Judge Albert Constable. A photographer permanently captured that autumn scene in a series of shots.[3]This changed under new state laws in 1922, which required all hangings to be executed at the Metropolitan Transition Center (formerly known as the Maryland State Penitentiary) in Baltimore. It was designed to get rid of "the curious mobs that frequent hangings taking place in the counties of this State, and who attempt to make public affairs of the same." 75 men were hanged on the Penitentiary gallows. Of these, 12 hangings were double hangings and on two occasions triple hangings took place. The first indoor hanging in the state, would come before this time though, with an execution on January 3, 1913, in the Baltimore City Jail, which only had invited guests present.There is one known instance of a botched execution by hanging. On January 30, 1930, Jack Johnson stood on the trapdoor after being convicted of a double murder. But as he fell through, the rope snapped and he fell to the ground below. He was left badly injured and carried to the top of the gallows on a stretcher. There, a new rope was placed around his neck and he was hanged, supported by a stretcher.The Maryland government decided in 1955 to change the method of execution to the use of gas inhalation. A total of four men were executed by this method, the first on June 28, 1957.After the Furman v. Georgia decision of the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that death penalty statutes were unconstitutionally arbitrary in their application, the Maryland legislature removed all arbitrariness by making death the mandatory punishment for first-degree murder once again. Such laws were found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional in Woodson v. North Carolina. As such, the Maryland legislature took the route which the Supreme Court had found acceptable in Gregg v. Georgia and introduced bifurcated trials, where the jury first decided guilt and then punishment, mandatory appellate review, and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.[4] Further laws changes in 1987 and 1989 excluded juveniles and people who had intellectual disabilities from execution.The first person to be sentenced to death under Maryland's current statute was Richard Danny Tichnell, who was found guilty of murdering Garrett County Sheriff's Deputy David Livengood in 1979. Tichnell's sentence was overturned on appeal, as were two successive death sentences that prosecutors won against him. A fourth jury declined to impose the death penalty, and Tichnell died in 2006 of natural causes while serving a life sentence.In 1994, the method was changed to lethal injection for persons convicted after March 25, 1994.[4] For persons sentenced before March 25, 1994, the condemned is given the choice between lethal injection and gas inhalation. John Thanos was put to death using lethal injection on May 16, 1994. This was the first execution in Maryland in over 30 years.Governor Parris N. Glendening halted executions in Maryland by executive order on May 9, 2002, while a state-ordered University of Maryland, College Park study of capital punishment was conducted.[4] The subsequent governor, Robert Ehrlich, ended the moratorium and resumed executions in 2004.[4]In 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals in Evans v. Maryland ruled that state executions would be suspended because the manual that spells out the protocol for lethal injections was not adopted using the process required by the state Administrative Procedures Act (APA).[5] The state APA requires state administrative agencies to adopt regulations, which are defined as statements that have general application and are adopted by an agency to detail or carry out a law that the agency administers, using a process that includes a review by the Attorney General, review by a legislative committee, and publication for public notice and comment. The state's Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services had adopted the manual without following any of these activities. The Court of Appeals noted that the procedures for execution in the manual were clearly regulations, and because they had not been properly adopted, they could not be used until they had been either adopted as required by the APA or the state law was changed.[5] The ruling in Evans, while not significant from an administrative law aspect as it was consistent with state case law, prevented executions until an agreement was reached regarding both the need for the death penalty and in the method and procedure to be used to carry it out.[6]The Maryland General Assembly in 2008 established the Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment to provide recommendations concerning the application and administration of capital punishment in the state so that they are free from bias and error and achieve fairness and accuracy.[7] Following a series of public hearings,[8] the Commission submitted its final report, along with a minority report, to the General Assembly on December 12, 2008, which "strongly recommends that capital punishment be abolished in Maryland."[9]On March 6, 2013, the Maryland State Senate voted 27–20 in favor of SB 276, a bill to repeal the death penalty for future offenders.[10] On March 15, 2013, the House approved the legislation by an 82–56 vote and sent the bill to Governor Martin O'Malley, who then signed it into law on May 2, 2013, declaring Maryland the 18th state in the US to ban the death penalty.[1][11][12]At the time of the repeal, only five inmates were on death row in Maryland: John Booth-El, Vernon Lee Evans, Anthony Grandison, Heath William Burch, and Jody Lee Miles. As the repeal was not retroactive, their death sentences were left in limbo.[13] On April 27, 2014, staff found Booth-El dead in his cell. He died of natural causes before his fate was determined, after spending nearly three decades on death row.[14] O'Malley announced on December 31, 2014, that he would commute the sentences of the four remaining death-row inmates to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[15][16]Maryland's stance on capital punishment garnered attention and significance in January 2021. Dustin Higgs, a man sentenced to death by the United States federal government in 2000, was executed on January 16, 2021. Higgs, the first person from Maryland to be sentenced to death in the federal court system, was tried by the federal government instead of the state of Maryland because the crime he was convicted of took place on federal land at the Patuxent Research Refuge in Prince George's County. Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones had urged Governor Larry Hogan to intervene and push for a halt to the execution.[17] The execution was carried out on January 16, 2021, via lethal injection.[18]Maryland has not had a death penalty since Gov. Martin O'Malley signed a bill on May 2, 2013.[1] Before the Governor signed the bill, only first-degree murder was a capital offense in the state of Maryland when it involved one of the following aggravating factors:[19]Under Criminal Law § 2–303, the sentence of death is imposed:…by intravenous administration of a lethal quantity of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate or other similar drug in combination with a chemical paralytic agent.The lethal injection procedure used in Maryland consisted of the anesthetic drug sodium pentothal, followed by the paralytic drug pancuronium bromide, which is also known as Pavulon, and lastly a drug which stops the heart, potassium chloride.[4] The execution is completed when, using an electrocardiogram, a physician declares the convict to be dead.[4]Unlike most states, Maryland did not offer the condemned a special last meal, instead the prisoner received whatever food the general prison population is served the day of the convict's death.[citation needed]Since the United States Supreme Court's Gregg v. Georgia decision in 1976, a total of 5 people convicted of murder have been executed by the state of Maryland. All were executed by lethal injection."
Saxon I K;"The Saxon I K (one-K) were a class of German narrow-gauge 0-6-0T locomotives of the Royal Saxon State Railways (Königlich Sächsischen Staatseisenbahnen, K.Sä.St.E.) with a track gauge of 750 mm (2 ft 5+1⁄2 in). In 1925, Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped these locomotives into their DRG class 99.750–752.From 1881 onwards, numerous narrow-gauge lines were opened in the Kingdom of Saxony, some of which were built with many inclines and curves. For this purpose, the Royal Saxon State Railways procured 39 small, six-coupled tank locomotives from the Sächsische Maschinenfabrik vormals Richard Hartmann AG in Chemnitz. From 1890 another five examples were delivered to the private Zittau-Oybin-Jonsdorfer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (ZOJE), which were taken over by the K.SäSt.E. in 1906, and in 1907 were given operating numbers 49 to 53 by the K.SäSt.E.The locomotives built for the K.Sä.St.E. were initially placed in the class H V TK, which was changed to K I in 1896 and I K in 1900.During the World War I, twenty locomotives were in use on the Heeresfeldbahn. Five of them remained in Poland in 1919. During the World War II, two of them were added to the inventory of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and designated as 99 2504 and 99 2505 respectively. They remained on their Polish routes and were returned to the Polish State Railways (PKP) after 1945. The last of them was scrapped in the Gdansk area in 1970.Thirty-nine locomotives were still part of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1920. The new numbers 99 7501 to 99 7527 were provided in the 1925 renumbering plan. A little later, however, all locomotives still owned by the state railway in Saxony were withdrawn.See also Saxon II K (old)With the increasing volume of traffic, the performance of the I K was soon no longer sufficient and – where the tracks allowed it – they were replaced by newer, more powerful locomotives such as  the class IV K.  In order to be able to use the available I K locomotives more effectively, the four first-built units were experimentally combined into two double locomotives in 1913. For this purpose, the rear wall of the locomotives' cabs were removed and two locomotive were coupled cab-to-cab. The locomotives were given a common regulator (throttle), but the controls remained separate. The converted locomotives received the class designation II K (the second use of this classification). It was planned to convert further locomotives in this way, but due to the First World War (a lack of locomotives due to the loan of vehicles to the Heeresfeldbahnen) and the unpopularity with the staff as well as the inadequacies in operation, this project was abandoned.The first locomotives converted were fleet numbers 1 and 4, which became 61 A / B. The second locomotive was the 62 A / B, which was converted from the I K numbers 2 and 3. However, this was separated again in 1916 due to a lack of locomotives, and the individual vehicles ran under their old numbers again.The II K 61 A/B was assigned the new number 99 7751 in 1923, but it was withdrawn in 1924 before the renumbering plan was finalized.The boiler was of the Crampton type, riveted, with two rings. Two non-lifting Friedmann injectors were used to feed the boiler. The chimney was equipped with a Kobel spark arrester, the first batch had this in a conical design.The drive train consisted of two cylinders mounted outside the frame, with slide valves, and driving the third axle via Allan valve gear.  The axles were rigidly mounted in the frame. Fleet numbers 27 to 30 were given a Klien-Lindner hollow axle at the front to improve the running through tight curves.The locomotive was braked using a counterweight brake. To brake the train, the cable reel for the Heberlein brake on the rear wall of the driver's cab was used.The water supply was housed in side tanks, while the coal bunker was in front of the cab on the fireman's side.The class I K was once used on almost all Saxon narrow-gauge railways. After the construction of the more powerful classes III K and IV K, the I K were mainly used on routes with light traffic. The last locations were the Zittau railway station and the Kohlmühle – Hohnstein, Klingenberg-Colmnitz – Oberdittmannsdorf routes and the network around Mügeln.After their retirement, seven I K locomotives were sold to industry as factory locomotives. The former number 12 was sold to the Schmiedeberg Ironworks in 1923, where it was in service until 1963, it was scrapped in 1964.After 1945, the Polish State Railways used the last two locomotives that remained in Poland on the remaining section of the Zittau – Hermsdorf line that was now in Poland.As part of the opening event for the "125 Years of Narrow Gauge Railways in Saxony" anniversary, the Association for the Promotion of Saxon Narrow Gauge Railways (Verein zur Förderung Sächsischer Schmalspurbahnen e.V., VSSB) announced on 12 January 2006 the project to build a new class I K locomotive. Since the original manufacturer no longer exists, the building was launched as a "network project". With the support of sponsors (donor shares were issued for the project) and companies, a large part of the components could be manufactured inexpensively. The Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works was selected for the overall assembly and manufacture of the boiler.A budget of €1.5 million was planned for the new building project. Since many of the components were made available free of charge by the companies involved, the calculated total costs fell to around one million euros. In November 2008, most of the – such as the driver's cab, steam boiler and chassis parts – were completed. In contrast to the riveted locomotives from the state railway era, the new building was largely made as a welded construction, so visible rivet heads are dummies. The machine was also equipped with a Körting vacuum brake. On 16 January 2009, final assembly began in the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works and was completed in June 2009. In continuation of the historical series of numbers (which ended with fleet number 53), the newly built locomotive was given the number 54.It was driven the first few meters under its own steam on 16 June 2009 in Meiningen. On 4 July 2009, the new locomotive was christened and officially put into service in the narrow-gauge area of Radebeul Ost station.[1] The new locomotive 54, which also bears the computer number 99 7528, was initially at home on the Preßnitztalbahn in Jöhstadt. On 30 August 2009, the locomotive was first used as scheduled in front of the museum trains between Jöhstadt and Steinbach. After the dissolution of the Association for the Promotion of Saxon Narrow Gauge Railways, the Saxon Narrow Gauge Railways Foundation (Stiftung Sächsische Schmalspurbahnen) has owned the locomotive since 2015 and has housed it with the Saxon-Upper Lusatian Railway Company (SOEG) from summer 2015. This does not change anything in the previous operating concept.[2]Since 2016, the I K No. 54 has had a suitable historical train, the "I K train", consisting of two-axle passenger cars, with which trips from circa 1900 can be offered. This train, which is based in Zittau, can travel on all existing narrow-gauge railways with a gauge of 750 mm.Naundorf, June 2010Oschatz, June 2010Mügeln, June 2010Schlössel station, October 2010Manual coaling-up in HainsbergIK-train at the "Historik Mobil" event Oybin station, 2019 "

Beulah (land);"Beulah is a land referred to in the Biblical Book of Isaiah. It is the land of the Jewish people, the Israelites, to which they must return: an earthly paradise.The land of Beulah is referred to in various hymns and other works.The only known ancient reference to a land called Beulah is in the book of Isaiah, 62:4. In Biblical Hebrew Beulah means "married", and is applied to the land that the people of Israel will marry:...you will be called Hephzibah,and your land Beulah,for the Lord will take delight in you,and your land will be married.As a young man marries a young woman... (New International Version)Hephzibah means "my delight is in her".The context is the Babylonian Exile, in which the land of Israel became holy to the Jews, their land to which they must return.There is no reference to a hill in this chapter of Isaiah.All later references to the land of Beulah are derivative of this one mention in the Bible.In the allegorical Christian novel Pilgrim's Progress (1678) by John Bunyan, Beulah Land is a place of peace near the end of the Christian life, on the border of the Celestial City. The River of Death separates Beulah from the New Jerusalem, the city on a hill.Now I saw in my dream, that by this time the pilgrims were got over the Enchanted Ground, and entering into the country of Beulah, whose air was very sweet and pleasant, the way lying directly through it, they solaced themselves there for a season. Yea, here they heard continually the singing of birds, and saw every day the flowers appear in the earth, and heard the voice of the turtle [dove] in the land. In this country the sun shineth night and day: wherefore this was beyond the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and also out of the reach of Giant Despair, neither could they from this place so much as see Doubting Castle. Here they were within sight of the city they were going to...[1]There are several relatively well-known hymns on the land of Beulah, whose similar titles can lead to confusion.It was in 1876 that I wrote "Beulah Land". I could write only two verses and the chorus, when I was overcome and fell on my face. That was one Sunday. On the following Sunday I wrote the third and fourth verses, and again I was so influenced by emotion that I could only pray and weep. The first time it was sung was at the regular Monday morning meeting of Methodists in Philadelphia. Bishop McCabe sang it to the assembled ministers. Since then it is known wherever religious people congregate. I have never received a cent for my songs. Perhaps that is why they have had such a wide popularity. I could not do work for the Master and receive pay for it.[3]There is some uncertainty about the origins of "Is Not This the Land of Beulah." Public domain records show it attributed to William Hunter, somewhere before 1884, yet other records credit William B. Bradbury with the modern arrangement being attributed to John W. Dadman in 1911.[5]Blues musician Mississippi John Hurt recorded a song for the Library of Congress in 1963, which was entitled "Beulah Land." First line: "I've got a mother in Beulah land".UK Blues musician Ian Siegal recorded a song called "Beulah Land" on his album The Picnic Sessions. First line: "Riders of the purple sage".Alternative piano artist Tori Amos wrote a song also entitled "Beulah Land", which was a B-side on her 1998 album From the Choirgirl Hotel.Composer Charles Ives used the hymn tune "Beulah Land"[which?] in his "String Quartet No.1" (1896), entitled "Salvation Army", and the second movement of his 4th Symphony.In the final moments of the opera The Ballad of Baby Doe, by Douglas Moore, the title character, referring to her husband, sings "In the circle of his arms I am safe in Beulah Land."The Tom Waits song, "Take Care Of All My Children," includes the line "I'll be goin' up to Beulah Land."The Vigilantes of Love song "Earth Has No Sorrow" from the album Killing Floor, includes the line "I hear angels 'cross that river in Beulah land".Songwriter Drew Nelson won international acclaim with the 2009 album "Dusty Road to Beulah Land", produced by Michael Crittenden of Mackinaw Harvest Music.  The album has been described as "a love song to the state of Michigan."  Local community radio station WYCE in Grand Rapids, Michigan, honored it as the "Best Local Album" at the 2010 Jammie Awards.Mahalia Jackson says that she will go “out sightseeing in Beulah” in her 1947 Gospel hit “I Will Move On Up A Little Higher”."
Decimal computer;"Decimal computers are computers which can represent numbers and addresses in decimal as well as providing instructions to operate on those numbers and addresses directly in decimal, without conversion to a pure binary representation. Some also had a variable wordlength, which enabled operations on numbers with a large number of digits.Early computers that were exclusively decimal include the ENIAC, IBM NORC, IBM 650, IBM 1620, IBM 7070, UNIVAC Solid State 80. In these machines, the basic unit of data was the decimal digit, encoded in one of several schemes, including binary-coded decimal (BCD), bi-quinary and two-out-of-five code.  Except for the IBM 1620 and 1710, these machines used word addressing. When non-numeric characters were used in these machines, they were encoded as two decimal digits. Other early computers were character oriented, providing instructions for performing arithmetic on character strings of decimal numerals, using BCD or excess-3 (XS-3)[1] for decimal digits. On these machines, the basic data element was an alphanumeric character, typically encoded in six bits. UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II used word addressing, with 12-character words. IBM examples include IBM 702, IBM 705, the IBM 1400 series,[2] IBM 7010, and the IBM 7080.The IBM System/360, introduced in 1964 to unify IBM's product lines, used per character binary addressing, and also included instructions for packed decimal arithmetic as well as binary integer arithmetic, and binary floating point. It used 8-bit characters and introduced EBCDIC encoding, though ASCII was also supported.[3] The Burroughs B2500 introduced in 1966 also used 8-bit EBCDIC or ASCII characters and could pack two decimal digits per byte, but it did not provide binary arithmetic, making it a decimal architecture.Several microprocessor families offer limited decimal support. For example, the 80x86 family of microprocessors provide instructions to convert one-byte BCD numbers (packed and unpacked) to binary format before or after arithmetic operations.[4] These operations were not extended to wider formats and hence are now slower than using 32-bit or wider BCD 'tricks' to compute in BCD.[5] The x87 FPU  has instructions to convert 10-byte (18 decimal digits) packed decimal data, although it then operates on them as floating-point numbers.The Motorola 68000 provided instructions for BCD addition and subtraction,[6] as does the 6502. In the much later 68000 family-derived processors, these instructions were removed when the Coldfire instruction set was defined, and all IBM mainframes also provide BCD integer arithmetic in hardware. The Zilog Z80, Motorola 6800 and its derivatives, together with other 8-bit processors, and also the Intel x86 family have special instructions that support conversion to and from BCD. The Psion Organiser I handheld computer’s manufacturer-supplied software implemented its floating point operations in software using BCD entirely. All later Psion models used binary only, rather than BCD.Decimal arithmetic is now becoming more common, for instance, three decimal types with two binary encodings were added to the 2008 IEEE 754r standard, with 7-, 16-, and 34-digit decimal significands.[7]The IBM Power6 processor and the IBM System z9 have implemented these types using the Densely Packed Decimal binary encoding,[8] the first in hardware and the second in microcode."

Classification of childhood weight;"Defining the parameters for childhood obesity has created substantial public awareness over the past decades. Stuart/Meredith Growth Charts were among the earliest growth charts widely used in the United States but were limited by not being representative of the entire US pediatric population.[1] Consequently, the need to develop growth charts that would encompass the ethnic, genetic, socioeconomic, environmental, and geographic diversity in the United States began in the 1970s.[1] In 1977, new growth charts were developed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) based on data collected by the National Health Examination Surveys.  However, these still contained many limitations and revised versions, as new information became available.[1] The 2000 CDC growth charts - a revised version of the 1977 NCHS growth charts - are the current standard tool for health care providers and offer 16 charts (8 for boys and 8 for girls), of which BMI-for-age is commonly used for aiding in the diagnoses of childhood obesity.[1]In 2004, the World Health Organization began planning new growth chart references that could be used in all countries based on the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) (1997–2003).[2] The MGRS was a multifaceted study which gathered data from 8,500 children from widely differing ethnic backgrounds and cultural settings.[2] The MGRS focused on describing growth pattern of children who followed recommended health practices and behaviors associated with healthy outcomes.[3] Upon recollection of data from MGRS, in 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched gender specific height-for-age and BMI-for-age charts for 5- to 19-year-olds (upper limit of adolescence as defined by WHO).[2] BMI-for-age, along with height-for-age, is the WHO recommended charts for assessing thinness, overweight, and obesity in school-aged children and adolescents.[4]According to both the WHO and CDC, BMI growth charts for children and teens are sensitive to both age-and sex-specific groups, justified by the differences in body fat between sexes and among different age groups.[5] The CDC BMI-for-age growth charts use age-and-gender specific percentiles to define where the child or teenagers stands as compared to the population standard to define overweight and obese categories.[5]  A public measure is one's socioeconomic status, which is determined by taking a group of peers and comparing characteristics like logistical differences, household income, parental occupations, and individual health into consideration.  These factors are then used to categorize people into a social group and link them to the likelihood of being overweight or obese.[6] For the CDC, a BMI greater than the 85th percentile but less than the 95th percentile is considered overweight, and a BMI of greater than or equal to the 95th percentile is considered obese.[5] WHO parameters for BMI-for-age parameters are defined by standard deviations and describe overweight to be greater than +1standard deviation from the mean (equivalent to BMI=25 kg/m2 at 19 years) and obese as +2 standard deviations from the mean for 5 to 19 year-olds (equivalent to BMI=30 kg/m2 at 19 years).[7]Furthermore, over the past years obesity rates have dramatically increased worldwide. Statistics from across the globe demonstrate that approximately 22 million children under the age of five are classified as obese.[8] Some health risks associated with childhood obesity include high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. These factors may eventually lead to further complications such as heart attack, stroke, a variety of cardiovascular conditions and if not treated properly and in a timely manner may ultimately result in death. Data concluded from the Bogalusa Heart Study demonstrates that approximately 60 percent of overweight children five to ten years of age had at least one cardiovascular risk factor.[8] A few examples of other health risks include Blount's disease, skin fungal infections, Acanthosis Nigracans, Hepatic Steatosis, in addition to both psychological and behavioral problems.[8] Overweight children often struggle to maintain high self-esteem and experience both depression and anxiety.[8] Social stigma of obesity may also be a contributing factor to some of these negative health outcomes, as many fat children experience bullying related to their size.

Bipin Chandra Joshi;"General Bipin Chandra Joshi, PVSM, AVSM, ADC (5 December 1935 – 19 November 1994) was the 17th Chief of Army Staff (COAS) of the Indian Army. He is the only Chief of the Indian Army to die in office, and until the 2021 death of General Bipin Rawat in a helicopter crash, the only full general and serving Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee to have died in office.Joshi was born in a Hindu Kumaoni Brahmin family. The time he became Army Chief, Pithoragarh & Almora were  parts of Uttar Pradesh. He was the first Army Chief  from Uttar Pradesh (Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand was a part of erstwhile Uttar Pradesh). Today Pithoragarh district falls within the borders of Uttarakhand.Joshi also became Colonel_(India)#Colonel_of_the_regiment of the 64 Cavalry later in his career.[citation needed]Joshi has been a recipient of the Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Ati Vishisht Seva Medal for distinguished service of the most exceptional order.Joshi died of a cardiac arrest in New Delhi Military Hospital on 18 November 1994.[4] He was due to retire in 1995. He was the first Chief of Indian Army who died in harness. General Bipin Rawat, former Chief and the serving Chief of Defence Staff, also died in a tragic helicopter crash in December 2021 whilst landing at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington. General Joshi’s untimely death changed the entire line of succession for the post of Chief of Army Staff, which is typically decided on the basis of seniority. As a result, Lt. Gen.

Craven Hill Gardens;"Coordinates: 51°30′46″N 0°10′56″W﻿ / ﻿51.51278°N 0.18222°W﻿ / 51.51278, -0.18222Craven Hill Gardens /kreɪvən/ is a classical, Victorian, residential garden estate which has two small garden squares, the green subset of squares in London. It is in Bayswater, in its Lancaster Gate neighbourhood, south-west of contemporary Paddington of which those districts were once part. It is made up of four rows of residential buildings lining its three streets, and eastern returns, between 160 and 250 metres north of Hyde Park.  The western return of this street configuration is partly Leinster Gardens and partly named Leinster Terrace.Numbers 13–23, the higher numbers of Craven Hill – a continuation street – face its larger private garden, one block of which is a listed building.  A 1960s block known as Corringham forms its second architecturally exceptional building and has a large private garden, the secondary garden.  Both gardens have trees surrounding.  The estate was a semi-rural possession of the Lords Craven in the 18th century.In fields west of the hamlet Bayswater (or Bayard's watering place as a text of 1380 first records) were the buildings of Upton farm, a few hundred yards back from the highway to Oxford at the end of a tree-lined lane, which William Craven, 3rd Baron Craven bought in 1733.[1]  In 1746 two buildings stood near the road east of the Bayswater rivulet and three on the west side.[1]  The lane still led through fields, to Lord Craven's early pest house, east of which were two more buildings, presumably barns, beside the rivulet.  The farm in 1742 was 'intended to be called Craven Hill'.[1]  Dwellings had replaced the pest house here, where publisher Edward Orme of Bond Street bought the lease of a house in 1811.[1] Artistic and literary figures were attracted to a district which was then semi-rural.[1] In 1834, poet Sarah Flower Adams (1805-48), moved with her husband to 5 Craven Hill, where they were soon followed by the author and politician William Johnson Fox (1786-1864) and his housekeeper the composer Eliza Flower.[1]By 1889, the wealthy southern newly made parish, Bayswater, was among an unbroken string of gold-coloured neighbourhoods by Hyde Park — documented in Booth's poverty map as socially distinct from the generally low-to-mid income central, neighbouring heartland, of what was left of Paddington.  Lancaster Gate East and West wards one of which contains the area, created in 1901, had initially 2.15 per cent and 2.58 of their inhabitants overcrowded, compared with 32.76 per cent in Church ward around Paddington Green.[1]In 1965 a change took place in the local authority (borough) of Craven Hill Gardens: the City of Westminster engulfed the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington, an identical area to the ancient parish of Paddington that included and was, historically, the description of the area.[1]The address forms two half-green rectangles whose remainder and surrounds are Victorian-built properties in tall, long terraces with a mixture of exposed ornamental brickwork, stone facings and many white or cream stucco fronts (façades), whether in part or whole.  Their use is as private apartments, hotels and international consulate/embassy and corporate lodgings.Craven Hill Gardens forms four rows of buildings numbered consecutively 1 to 42, one row of which is Corringham (nos 13–15).Two of its terraces are listed buildings:The Hempel Hotel was on the street.[5]"
Matt Simms (American football);"Matthew Phillip Simms[1] (born September 27, 1988) is a former American football quarterback. He played college football at Tennessee, before being signed by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent in 2012. Simms is the son of former New York Giants quarterback and Super Bowl XXI MVP Phil Simms and younger brother of former NFL quarterback Chris Simms.[2]Simms was born in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey to Diana and Phil Simms. His older brother, Chris, played quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following an extraordinary career at Ramapo High School. Matt attended Don Bosco Preparatory High School in Ramsey, New Jersey where he played quarterback on the football team for three years.[3] During this time, he passed for more than 6,000 yards and 60 touchdowns. Though the team lost the state championship game his junior year, he was selected as a first-team All-State player by the Associated Press. The next year, they went undefeated and won the state title. After his senior year, he played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.[4]After graduating from high school, Simms received a scholarship to the University of Louisville.[5] During his freshman year, he saw limited action, playing in two games and throwing four passes. Simms then left Louisville to attend El Camino College in Torrance, California. While at El Camino he led the team to its fourth consecutive league title and threw for over 2,000 yards in ten games.[4]Simms later left El Camino for the University of Tennessee. As a child, he always had a dislike for Tennessee's rival, the University of Florida.[6] During the 2010 season, he played in ten games and threw for over 1,400 yards.[7]During the 2010 season, Simms was hampered by injuries to key receivers.[8] He lost the starting job late in the season to Tyler Bray due to poor performance.[9][10]Simms's performance was the subject of a widely reported "heated dispute" between Desmond Howard and Phil Simms during the week before Super Bowl XLV.[10]In the 2011 season, Simms appeared in seven games and started two. He was 27 of 62 for 319 passing yards and three interceptions.[11]Simms was signed by the New York Jets on May 6, 2012.[13] He was waived on August 31, 2012.[14] Simms signed a future/reserve contract on December 31, 2012.[15]Simms received playing time during the preseason against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2013. He completed all five of his passes for 73 yards.[16] Simms played the following week against the New York Giants completing 6 of his 10 pass attempts for 120 yards and a touchdown.[17] On August 29, the final preseason contest, Simms started and played the entire game against the Philadelphia Eagles. He completed 33 of his 44 pass attempts for 285 yards.[18]Simms threw his first career touchdown pass to tight end Jeff Cumberland in a Week 11 37–14 loss to the Buffalo Bills.[19] During Week 13 against the Miami Dolphins, Simms came in relief of starter Geno Smith in the third quarter, he completed 9 of his 18 passes for 79 yards with an interception and a lost fumble in the Jets' 3–23 loss. Simms appeared in three games of the 2013 season and finished the year with 156 passing yards.[20]Simms, an exclusive rights free agent, was re-signed by the Jets on January 13, 2014.[21] He was released on August 30, 2014, during the team's final roster cuts[22] and signed to the team's practice squad a day later.[23] He was promoted to the active roster on November 1, 2014.[24] He appeared in one game, a 24–10 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, with the Jets in the 2014 season. He was 3-of-8 for 39 yards.[25]Simms signed a one-year contract to remain with the Jets on December 30, 2014.[26] However, after the team drafted Bryce Petty and signed undrafted rookie Jake Heaps, Simms requested his release and was granted it on May 28, 2015.[27][28]The Buffalo Bills claimed Simms off waivers on May 29, 2015.[29] Simms was not expected to compete in the three-way competition for the starting quarterback position (Tyrod Taylor, EJ Manuel, and Matt Cassel) but was in the mix as a potential backup quarterback and was given the start for the Bills' final preseason game against the Detroit Lions on September 3. Late in that game, Simms, while trying to break a tackle, inadvertently threw the ball 20 yards backward, creating a loose-ball situation and setting the Lions up for the game-winning score.[30] Simms was released the next day.[31]On September 7, 2015, Simms was signed to the Atlanta Falcons' practice squad.[32] On September 3, 2016, he was waived by the Falcons as part of final roster cuts and was signed to their practice squad the next day.[33][34][35]On May 15, 2017, Simms re-signed with the Falcons.[36] He was waived/injured on September 2, 2017, and placed on injured reserve.[37] He was released with an injury settlement on September 5, 2017.[38]On November 27, 2018, he was selected in the second round by the Atlanta Legends in the 2019 AAF QB Draft.[39]Simms started the 2019 AAF season opener against the Orlando Apollos, during which he completed 15 of 28 passes for 126 yards and two interceptions in the 40–6 loss.[40]On August 3, 2019, Simms was signed by the Atlanta Falcons to replace injured Kurt Benkert.[41] He was placed on injured reserve on August 31, 2019.[42]"
Harrison J. Pinkett;"Harrison J. Pinkett (1882 – July 19, 1960) was a journalist and civil rights activist in Washington DC and then a lawyer in Omaha, Nebraska. As a journalist, he was the head of the so-called "Press Bureau" and often used the bureau's collective pen name, "P.S. Twister". In 1907, at the recommendation of friends in the NAACP, he moved  to Omaha where he frequently worked in civil rights. He served as a first lieutenant in the 92nd Infantry Division in World War I and frequently defended the rights of black soldiers.Harrison J. Pinkett was born in Luray, Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley in 1882 to Civil War Veteran Charles Pinkett, of Indian and black ancestry, and Columbia Kemper, a white woman. He had fifteen siblings, seven of whom died in early youth. Included among these are two sisters, Daisy and Carrie, and four brothers, Archibald S, Wallace, Martin, and Charles. His father was a wagon maker and wheel wright. Archibald was also a lawyer and served as Secretary of the Washington DC branch of the NAACP.Along with Archibald, Harrison was a part of the Howard University Law School class of 1906.[1] He also received education at Columbia University.[2] In DC, Pinkett worked as a bricklayer and printer and worked for a time as a printer in Martinsburg, West Virginia and as an apprentice journalist at the Pioneer Press.[3] His first wife was Eva Madah Banks. Eva died January 20, 1948. He later remarried and his second wife was named Venus.[2]In 1936 he was interviewed by the Federal Writers Project funded by the Works Progress Administration. In that interview he talks about his life and especially about the lynching of Willy Brown.[4]Pinkett was active in student affairs while at Howard. He took part in the Blackstone Club[5] and was active at the Bethel Literary and Historical Society (where he was secretary[6]) and the Richards Debating Club.[3] In 1905, Pinkett acted as secretary of the first meeting of the Niagara Society in Washington, DC presided by DC Society Head, Lafayette McKeene Hershaw.[7] Hershaw was then elected secretary  with the presidency going to John F. Cook: Pinkett shifted to assistant secretary. Other officers included, Lewis Henry Douglass, Francis James Grimké, William Henry Harrison Hart, William Calvin Chase, William H Richard, John Wesley Cromwell, and William C. Martin.[8]In January, 1907, Pickett was admitted to the DC bar[9] and became a prolific writer for black papers. He served as manager and attorney of a group called the Press Bureau under the pen name "P.S. Twister". In this capacity, he was deeply critical of other black leaders, including Journalist R. W. Thompson,[10] and of Howard University President, Wilbur P. Thirkield[11] for their support of the election of Booker T. Washington, Jesse E. Moorland, J. H. N. Warring, and John T. Baldwin to the Board of that university because of their connection with capitalists[12] as well as previous Howard University President, John Gordon.[13] Writings under this pen name ceased and he was asked by black leaders to consider practicing law in Omaha, where he moved in 1908 becoming the first University trained lawyer in Nebraska.[2] Pinkett's connection to DC continued, and W. E. B. Du Bois visited Pinket in Omaha in the summer of 1908.[14]When he arrived in Omaha, he was listed as one of four black lawyers along with S Robbins, F L Smith, and J W Carr.[15] An early national case Pinkett worked in was in support of black troops stationed in Omaha who were erroneously discharged for involvement in the 1906 Brownsville Affair which falsely accused troops stationed in Brownsville of a disturbance at Brownsville bars resulting in the death of a white bartender and the wounding of a police officer. The affair reached Omaha when an imposter who went by the name G S Ward claiming to represent Senator Joseph B. Foraker and presenting a list to the command at Fort Omaha of individuals who supposedly confessed to involvement.[16] He also spoke out against the mob involved Greek Town riot of 1909.[17]In 1911, he wrote an affidavit in support of newly elected governor Chester Hardy Aldrich's accusations of fraud (that three times as many votes were cast as the population supported) in the election in Omaha's third ward,[18] a position which put him in opposition to Tom Dennison's supposed machinations and in support of John Lewis[19] and his Anti-Saloon League.[20] In a not dissimilar situation, Pinkett was a part of campaigns in 1916 to make Douglass County a dry county.[21]Blacks were not united in support of Pinkett, however. He was heavily involved in the prosecution of black businesses in Omaha's Midway, which before World War I was the city's red light district.[22] He spoke against saloons and bootlegging joints and called for greater enforcement of laws against drug sales, noting the availability of morphine, opium, and cocaine. Both before and after the war he worked for the newspaper, The Monitor, which gave his message a voice,[23] and in 1921 he started the short-lived newspaper A New Era.Pinkett was a strong patriot and in the days before the United States declared war on the German Empire and joined World War I, he wrote a letter to the Omaha World Herald in support of the action and calling blacks to service.[24] Pinkett enlisted, becoming one of five Omaha officers (Pinkett was a first lieutenant).[25]Pinkett received his commission at Fort Des Moines on October 15, 1917 after five months training and first reported to Camp Dodge. He served with as battalion adjutant for the first battalion of the 366th Infantry in the 92nd Infantry Division. He landed in France on June 26, 1918 and was stationed for six weeks at Bourbonne for training. He then was sent to the Boche to the Vosges sector. He saw active service for a month on the Vosges sector, he was ten days on the Argonne, and a month on the Metz sector where he was when armistice was signed. He believed his men fought gallantly, noting that of 32 distinguished services medals given to the 92nd division, his organization received 22 of them.[26] Upon the end of World War II, Pinkett remembered the hearing of the November 11, 1918 armistice while under fire in front of Metz, saying, "The colored boys under me laid down their rifles, and the Germans did the same. They rushed across the clearing that separated them and embraced with joy."[27]Near the end of the war while serving in Mayenne, France Pinkett continued to write editorials to the World Herald, writing in support of a national cemetery in France.[28] Pinkett returned to the US March 1, and was discharged at Camp Upton on March 8 and returned to Omaha shortly after.[26]In early 1921, Pinkett became the focus of a controversy in Omaha. In part, the controversy arose when he sued pastor W C Williams of St. John AME Church (where Pinkett had been a member) over financial irregularities when the church built a factory for the employment of the women in the church.[29] At nearly the same time, Pinkett hired George Wells Parker to be editor of the newspaper "The New Era", a paper Pinkett paid to produce. When the pair disagreed over the contents of the paper, Parker created a new paper, "The Omaha Whip" which managed two editions before closing. Parker accused Pinket and two other men, Ole Jackson and Johnny Moore, of promising to give the black vote to police superintendent Dean Ringer. The accusations included that the police look the other way while Moore, who had recently been released from prison, and Jackson sold "anything they want to sell".[30] Further, Parker accused Pinkett of association with the supporters of the Ku-Klux-Klan and called on Omahan's to stand by the campaigns of Mayor James C. Dahlman and his party.[31] Williams preached in support of Parker and against what he believed was police protection of these joints and called black candidate for police commissioner John T. McDonald, Sr to state his position. Williams also associated his opponents with a group called the "committee of 5,000" which he claimed consisted of the ministers and members of white Protestant churches in Omaha who campaigned against Jews, Catholics, and blacks in the city and supposedly had KKK ties[32]The Omaha NAACP was founded in 1918 after Mary White Ovington spoke in Omaha and after the end of World War I was led by Pinkett and Father John Albert Williams. W. E. B. Du Bois came and spoke to the group in May 1919 and Mayor Edward P. Smith was in attendance.[22] An important cause of the violence throughout 1919 were cases of police or media sensationalize of crimes perpetrated by blacks and the resulting anger and violence of whites. When the paper, the Omaha Bee, ran such a story, the Omaha NAACP organized a rally in protest of over 600 people. Another report in the Bee of a rape allegation against Willy Brown in September 1919 is often considered the instigation of violence by a mob of whites culmination in the lynching of Willy Brown and followed by more rioting and violence. Among others, Williams and Pinkett worked to bring peace in the city.[33] Pinkett would later blame the riots on the Dennison machine as an action in support of Dahlman and against Smith for Mayor.[34]In a similar indecent seven years later, Pinkett played another important role. Blacks living in North Platte faced mob violence and fled the city after a police officer was killed on July 15, 1929. Pinkett, John Andrew Singleton, and E W Killingsworth petitioned the governor to step in and worked closely with the governor in reducing tension and allowing the people to return to their homes.[35]In the case of street violence, Pinkett supported increased policing both of blacks and whites. Pinkett also protested what he felt was inequal enforcement and police harassment of blacks and black owned businesses. In 1922, he served as the attorney for Robert H. Johnson, who he felt was a victim of a different kind of police abuse. Johnson was a political agitator who supported M. L. Endes for police commissioner and who was arrested and held in jail the week of the election. Pinkett claimed in court that Johnson's right of habeas corpus was illegally taken and the acts of the police were in retaliation for Johnson's politics.[36]Pinkett also continued a somewhat antagonistic involvement in Howard University affairs, working to remove John Stanley from president of the institution.[37] Indeed, the vehemence of his positions was not without cost. On October 26, 1927, Picket was attacked by a man brandishing a pistol in response to his work with Reverend John Grant of St. John's AME against gambling.[38]In 1928, the NAACP retained Pinkett to aid in the defense of serial killer Jake "the Chopper" Bird - defense was led by Edwin D Mitchell.[39]In conjunction with other black leaders, including Father John Albert Williams, John Andrew Singleton, and Thomas P. Mahammitt, Pinkett was instrumental in the creation of Omaha's Colored Commercial Club to support black business in Omaha[40] and while generally a Republican,[41] supported of the Negro Democratic Club.[42]  He was also an integral part of the Omaha Branch of the NAACP and, along with John Williams and W. W. Peebles, and strongly spoke out against the World Herald's publishing remarks of KKK imperial wizard, Hiram Wesley Evans.[43] He continued to work with veterans and was an officer Roosevelt Post No. 30, American Legion.[44]Later in his career he frequently lectured on African American history and continued involvement with civic organizations.[45] In 1933, Pinkett ran for the post of city commissioner[46] where he lost in the primary. In 1936, ran and lost again. He continued to write letters to the editor in support of civil rights as well as work as a defense attorney and as council for the NAACP in Omaha until his death in 1960.[2]"

Ruud Gullit;"Ruud Gullit (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈryt ˈxʏlɪt] (listen),[5] born Rudi Dil, 1 September 1962) is a Dutch footballer and subsequent manager who played professionally in the 1980s and 1990s as a defender, midfielder or forward. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.[6] He captained the Netherlands national team that was victorious at UEFA Euro 1988 and was also a member of the squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup and Euro 1992.At club level, in 1987 he moved from PSV to AC Milan for a world record transfer fee.[7] Nicknamed "the black Tulip", he was part of a notable Dutch trio at Milan which included Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard. Gullit won three Serie A titles and two European Cups with Milan. In 1995, he signed for Chelsea and a year later was appointed the club's player-manager. In his debut season, he led Chelsea to FA Cup success, the club's first major title for 26 years, and in doing so became the first overseas manager to win the FA Cup.Gullit won the Ballon d'Or in 1987 and was named the World Soccer Player of the Year in 1987 and 1989. Normally an attacking midfielder,[8] he was a versatile player, playing in numerous positions during his career. In 2004, he was named one of the Top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA's 100th anniversary celebration.[9]Gullit was born as Rudi Dil in Amsterdam to George Gullit, a Surinamese who arrived in the Netherlands with Herman Rijkaard (father of Frank Rijkaard),[10] and Dutch mistress Ria Dil[11] from the Jordaan district of Amsterdam. The Gullit family lived in one split level room on the top floor of a small apartment building. Gullit's father worked as an economics teacher at a local school, his mother as a custodian at the Rijksmuseum.Gullit developed his football skills in the confines of the Rozendwarsstraat, and street football was instrumental in his formative years. Gullit's first team were the Meerboys, where he joined as a junior in 1970. At the age of ten, however, Gullit moved from the Jordaan to Amsterdam Old West where he played street football alongside Frank Rijkaard. Gullit joined the DWS club after his move, and came to the attention of the Dutch youth team, where he played alongside future full international teammates, Erwin Koeman, Ronald Koeman and Wim Kieft.It was during his time at DWS that Gullit first took to using his father's surname, rather than his registered surname (from his mother), as he thought Gullit sounded more like a football player.[12] However he retained his mother's surname, officially, and continues to sign all contracts as Ruud Dil.[citation needed]September 22nd 1978, Gullit signed professionally for HFC Haarlem under coach and former West Bromwich Albion player Barry Hughes. Gullit made 91 league appearances for Haarlem, scoring 32 goals. He made his debut for the club at just 16 years and 11 months old, on August 19th 1979 (Haarlem-MVV Maastricht 2-2), becoming at the time the youngest player in the history of the Eredivisie.[13] In his first year at Haarlem, the club finished bottom of the Eredivisie, but bounced back the following season winning the Eerste Divisie. Gullit was named as the best player in the Eerste Divisie that season.[14] In the 1981–82 season, Gullit was in fine form as Haarlem finished fourth and qualified for Europe for the only time in their history. In that same season, Gullit scored the goal he would later consider his finest: "Playing against Utrecht I went past four defenders and then the goalkeeper, and scored. It was an unforgettable goal for me."[15] Hughes was so impressed with the young Gullit that he described him as the "Dutch Duncan Edwards".[14]The young Gullit was considered as a signing by English sides Arsenal and Ipswich Town, but managers Terry Neill and Bobby Robson turned him down. Neill later told that he considered £30,000 too much for "this wild kid".[16] Gullit therefore moved to Feyenoord in 1982, where he made 85 league appearances, scoring 31 goals. At Feyenoord, Gullit found himself playing in his second season 1983/84, alongside Dutch legend Johan Cruyff, while the assistant manager was Wim van Hanegem, and they were to leave a lasting impression.Gullit's first season saw Feyenoord miss out on major honours, but the following year they completed the league and cup double. Gullit was named Dutch Footballer of the Year in recognition of his contribution to Feyenoord's success. At Feyenoord, Gullit occupied an increasingly advanced role in midfield, having played predominantly as a sweeper at Haarlem.[17] While at Feyenoord, Gullit became the focus of a race row as manager Thijs Libregts was alleged to have referred to Gullit as "blackie" and criticised him for being lazy, though Libregts defended himself by claiming that it was merely a nickname.[18] While playing for Feyenoord at St Mirren in September 1983, he was racially abused and spat on by supporters of the Scottish club.[19] Gullit called it "the saddest night of my life".[20]In 1985, Gullit moved to PSV for 1.2 million Dutch guilders and wound up scoring 46 goals in 68 league appearances for the team. Gullit was again named Footballer of the Year in 1986 as he helped PSV capture the Eredivisie crown, a feat they repeated the following year. It was at PSV that Gullit really began to establish himself as a world class footballer and his distinctive, dreadlocked appearance made certain that he would catch the eye of Europe's biggest clubs. Gullit was also singled out for criticism by large numbers of Feyenoord supporters, who branded him a "wolf" and accused him of moving to Eindhoven for money.[21]Gullit signed for AC Milan in 1987, paying the then world record transfer fee of 18 million guilders as a replacement for Ray Wilkins. Milan's club leader Silvio Berlusconi had ambition to revive the fortunes of the Italian club which had stagnated after its glory days in the 1960s. Among Gullit's teammates at that club were compatriot Marco van Basten, who came at the same time. A year later they'd be joined by another compatriot and old friend Frank Rijkaard. The club also had then young Italian rising stars Paolo Maldini and Franco Baresi. Gullit's exploits with first PSV and then Milan helped him win the Ballon d'Or award in 1987 which he dedicated to Nelson Mandela.[6]When he arrived at Milan, Gullit initially struggled to fit in as he spoke no Italian and was unused to living in a foreign country.[22] Gullit's first season at Milan, however, saw the club win the Scudetto for the first time in nine years, under coach Arrigo Sacchi. He was initially used on the right of an attacking trio alongside Van Basten and Pietro Virdis, but after an injury to Van Basten it was changed to a front two. The following season Milan built on their domestic success by adding the European Cup to their list of honours. Their scintillating 5–0 demolition of Real Madrid in the semi-final second leg came at a cost, as Gullit suffered an injury and required surgery to be fit in time for the final. That performance was followed by a 4–0 victory over Steaua București in the 1989 final, with Gullit scoring two crucial goals. The following year, Milan retained the trophy as they defeated Benfica in the 1990 final. However, serious injuries sustained to the ligaments of his right knee limited Gullit's playing time and he managed just two domestic games in the 1989–90 season before appearing in the cup final.In 1990–91, Milan's pursuit of a third consecutive European Cup was cut short by Marseille at the quarter-final stage. Having drawn the first leg at the San Siro, Milan trailed to a Chris Waddle goal with little time remaining when the floodlights went out. After a short delay the lighting was restored, but Milan had returned to their dressing room and refused to return to complete the game. UEFA awarded Marseille a 3–0 victory and expelled Milan from all European competitions for the following season.While Milan continued their domestic dominance by winning Serie A in both 1991–92 (a season in which they went undefeated) and 1992–93, Gullit's position became an increasingly peripheral one under new coach Fabio Capello. This was demonstrated by his omission from the 1993 Champions League final, as under the UEFA rules clubs were only allowed to field three foreigners.Torino was interested in signing him, with the chairman claiming that an agreement with Milan was likely.[23] Bayern Munich was also in talks with Gullit, but an agreement fell through.[24] Instead, Gullit was loaned to Sampdoria.In 1993, Gullit moved to Sampdoria and led them to victory in the Coppa Italia in the 1993–94 season. He also scored the winner in a 3–2 victory over Milan. Gullit was briefly re-signed by Milan in 1994, but quickly returned to Sampdoria before the culmination of the 1994–95 season. During his time, he served under manager Sven-Göran Eriksson and the two had a strong understanding and mutual respect. In his brief time at Sampdoria, he scored 15 goals.In July 1995, Gullit signed for Chelsea on a free transfer. Initially played as sweeper by manager Glenn Hoddle with limited success, Gullit was moved to his more familiar role in midfield, where he scored six goals. The signing of Gullit, alongside the likes of Mark Hughes and Dan Petrescu, propelled Chelsea to the semi-final of the FA Cup but their league form was disappointing.Gullit had some difficulties adapting to the style of play at Chelsea: "I would take a difficult ball, control it, make space and play a good ball in front of the right back, except that he didn't want that pass. Eventually Glenn said to me, 'Ruud, it would be better if you do these things in midfield.'"[25] His adjustment, however, was rapid and he ended the season by being named runner-up to Eric Cantona as Footballer of the Year.Gullit has since often stated in interviews that it was in London he enjoyed his career the most and felt happiest: "Every time I played for Chelsea, I thought, 'Nice game, beautiful stadium, great crowd, I'm playing well.' It was the only time I really had fun."[25] In moving to Chelsea, Gullit played an important part in the "foreign revolution" as numerous high-profile international stars, such as Italian Gianfranco Zola and Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp, joined Chelsea and Arsenal respectively, which helped to increase its worldwide profile.In 1981, on his 19th birthday, Gullit made his international debut as a substitute for the Netherlands national team against Switzerland, a game the Dutch lost 2–1. During his early international career, the team failed to qualify for both the 1982 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1984 - missing out on the latter tournament on goals scored as Spain, needing an 11-goal victory to qualify, trounced minnows Malta 12–1 in their final qualifying game.There was further frustration in 1985 when the Dutch missed out on qualification for the World Cup at the hands of neighbours Belgium in a play-off. Having lost 1–0 in Belgium, the Netherlands appeared to be set for qualification in Rotterdam as they led 2–0 until a late Georges Grün goal put Belgium through on away goals.Gullit, however, was one of the key players for the Netherlands as he helped his country win Euro 1988 under coach Rinus Michels. Having lost their opening game of the tournament to the Soviet Union, the Netherlands beat England and the Republic of Ireland to reach the semi-finals. After defeating West Germany 2–1 in Hamburg, the Netherlands faced the Soviet Union again in the final. Gullit opened the scoring with a header and Marco van Basten scored a volley from a narrow angle to cap a 2–0 win. Gullit was thus the first Dutch captain to hold aloft international silverware.[26]The Dutch travelled to the 1990 World Cup as one of the favourites, but the team failed to perform as expected. There was also internal trouble related to selection of the national team coach (players consulted had voted for Johan Cruijff, but the Dutch FA and especially its leader Rinus Michels snubbed them and chose Leo Beenhakker). Gullit's knee injuries also hampered his play, but his dribble and shot against Ireland helped the Netherlands qualify for the second round. There they met West Germany, in a game marred by an altercation between Frank Rijkaard and Rudi Völler. The Germans gained revenge for their defeat at Euro 1988 by beating the Netherlands 2–1 and going on to win the tournament.1992 saw the Netherlands again among the favourites for silverware in Sweden at Euro 1992. Gullit appeared in strong form against Scotland in their opening game of the tournament as he supplied Dennis Bergkamp with a goal. But after drawing with Russia and beating Germany, the Netherlands suffered a shock exit on penalties to Denmark, who ended up winning the championship's Henri Delaunay Trophy.In 1993, Gullit and Netherlands manager Dick Advocaat began what was to be a long-running dispute which ultimately ended Gullit's international career. Advocaat's decision to play Gullit on the right side of midfield in a game against England at Wembley, rather than his usual central position, upset Gullit and this was exacerbated by his substitution for Marc Overmars.[18] Gullit refused to play for the national team following this but later changed his mind and agreed to return, facing Scotland in May 1994. Shortly before the 1994 World Cup, Gullit walked out of the pre-tournament training camp and would never play international football again. In December 2013, while appearing on Dutch television program Studio Voetbal, Gullit and Advocaat stated they were both at fault in the matter and regretted it.[citation needed]A complete and versatile player, Gullit epitomised the ethos of Total Football as he was naturally adept in several positions, and was capable of aiding his team defensively as well as offensively due to his work-rate, ball-winning abilities, and tactical intelligence in addition to his skill and physical qualities.[27] Normally deployed as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker, he was capable of playing anywhere in midfield or along the front-line, on either wing or even in the centre, and could also play as a sweeper.[8] Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[28] his foremost attribute was his athleticism, as he used his strength and speed, combined with his technique, to great effect, he was also strong in the air, as he was tall, powerful, and an excellent jumper.[27][29] Yet, unusually for a man of his stature, Gullit was an elegant player, who also possessed outstanding natural balance, poise, technical ability, and dribbling skills, which gave a graceful style to his game.[27] Gullit also was noted for his intelligence, creativity, vision, and spatial abilities, qualities that helped him score goals early in his career and enabled him to play in a deeper role as a playmaker late in his days, where he was known for creating chances for teammates.[27] Gullit thus combined physical presence with flair, mental acuity, formidable technique and natural touch, to become an iconic figure in world football.[27][30] He was also an accurate free kick taker.[31] Beyond his qualities as a footballer, Gullit also stood for his leadership and tenacity.[32] Despite his talent, however, he struggled with injuries throughout his career, which later affected his fitness.[27]Gullit's brilliance prompted George Best to comment in 1990, "Ruud Gullit is a great player by any standards. He has all the skills. He's not afraid to do things with the ball. And he looks as if he's enjoying every second of it. By my reckoning that's what makes him an even better player than Maradona. Both have the key quality you will find in all the best players: balance. You just can't knock them off the ball. It was the same with Pelé, Beckenbauer and Cruyff."[33]In the summer of 1996, when Glenn Hoddle left Chelsea to become manager of the England national team, Gullit was appointed as a player-manager becoming the first Dutch manager in the Premier League. Gullit made a promising start to his managerial career when in the first season as a player-manager he guided Chelsea to an FA Cup triumph in 1997, the club's first major trophy in 26 years. In doing so he became the first manager from outside the British Isles and the first black manager to win a major British football trophy.[34] The club also finished at a creditable sixth place in the Premiership.The following season, with Chelsea in second place in the Premiership and proceeding to the quarter-finals in two cup competitions, he was sacked, allegedly for a disagreement with the club's board over compensation, though Gullit himself disputed this.[35] He was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, a man he had helped to bring to the club, and who went on to guide them to UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and Football League Cup glory over the remainder of the season. Gullit's last appearance as a player came in the first leg of that season's League Cup semi-final against Arsenal, but Gullit was sacked before the second leg.[36] After Gullit's controversial sacking by Chelsea, chairman Ken Bates said of Gullit, "I didn't like his arrogance – in fact I never liked him."[37]In August 1998, Gullit was named manager of Newcastle United two games into the new league season and reached the 1999 FA Cup Final in his first year. Fans remained supportive despite a poor run of results, although a well-publicised contretemps with the team's top scorer Alan Shearer and captain Robert Lee did not put him in a favourable light.[38] Gullit even refused to assign Lee a squad number, giving Lee's number 7 to new signing Kieron Dyer. In a match between Newcastle and local rivals Sunderland following the latter's return to the Premiership, Gullit left the usual starting strikers Shearer and Duncan Ferguson on the bench. Newcastle lost 2–1, and Gullit resigned three days later, five games into the 1999–2000 season.[39]Before the start of the 2004–05 season, Gullit took charge of Feyenoord, quitting at the end of that season without winning any trophies, being replaced by Erwin Koeman. Feyenoord had finished a disappointing fourth in the Eredivisie, behind Ajax, PSV and AZ.On 8 November 2007, Gullit became head coach for the LA Galaxy, signing a three-year contract.[40] His US$2 million per year salary was the highest ever given to a Major League Soccer (MLS) head coach. Gullit arrived as replacement for Frank Yallop who was let go after Galaxy failed to make the 2007 MLS playoffs despite having record signing David Beckham on the roster.From the start, Gullit's time with Galaxy was troublesome. Not well-versed in the intricacies and specifics of the MLS such as salary cap and draft rules, the Dutchman never adapted well to the North American league.[citation needed] The ill-fated acquisition in January 2008 of left back Celestine Babayaro, who was signed on Gullit's personal wishes before being dismissed without playing a competitive match, set the tone for the league campaign. After losing 0–4 in the season opener, Gullit clashed with midfielder Peter Vagenas, who criticized him for completely neglecting set-play practice during training.[citation needed]As the season progressed, Gullit clashed with several players, notably Landon Donovan and Abel Xavier, the latter who criticized Gullit's managerial style and claimed he did not have respect for most of the players.[41] It was later reported that Gullit's appointment had been made in controversial fashion as Galaxy general manager, Alexi Lalas, had been bypassed in the process, with the decision being led by David Beckham's advisers: his management company 19 Entertainment and his personal manager Terry Byrne.[42]On 11 August 2008, Gullit resigned as coach of the Galaxy, citing personal reasons. This came following a seven-game winless streak. General manager Lalas was fired at the same time.[43]On 18 January 2011, Russian Premier League side Terek Grozny announced that Gullit has agreed to sign a year-and-a-half contract and become the head coach for the Chechen side. Upon signing, Gullit told Sovetsky Sport, "I'd like to believe that I can bring joy into the lives of the Chechen people through football... Of course, I won't deny that I'm getting lots of money from Terek."[44] Gullit was let go by the club on 14 June 2011.In 1988, Gullit scored a No. 3 hit with the anti-apartheid song "South Africa" in the Dutch Top 40 together with the reggae band Revelation Time. Previously, he had a modest hit in 1984 with the song "Not the Dancing Kind". Gullit also notably joined his band in front of 3000 people at concerts in Italy, in the year he made a move to AC Milan.After his spell at Newcastle, Gullit spent several years working as a football commentator, having previously coined the term "sexy football"[45] during his spell as a BBC pundit for Euro 1996 while still playing professionally for Chelsea. Gullit used the term to describe teams, such as Portugal at that tournament,[46] who played attractive football with an emphasis on the defense-penetrating pass-and-move game.By 2006, Gullit had a talk show on Dutch TV, where he has interviewed, amongst others, Nelson Mandela.[6] When Gullit was named winner of the Ballon d'Or in 1987, he dedicated the award to the then imprisoned Nelson Mandela. Gullit has since said in interviews that he met Mandela after he was released, and that Mandela had said to him, "Ruud, I have lots of friends now. When I was on the inside, you were one of the few."[25]In 2007, Gullit recalled, "Four months ago I visited Robben Island and met three guys who were cell-mates of Nelson Mandela. They remembered me dedicating my award in 1987 to Mandela and they said they couldn't believe what I had done, and were sure the football authorities would withdraw the award. That's what apartheid did to them, it made them believe injustice was a normal part of life."[25]Gullit also appeared as a pundit for ITV during the 2006 World Cup and works as an analyst for Champions League games on Sky Sports and Al Jazeera Sports. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Gullit worked as a studio analyst alongside former players Jürgen Klinsmann and Steve McManaman for ESPN.[47] He subsequently worked as an analyst for Al Jazeera Sports during Euro 2012 alongside Glenn Hoddle and Terry Venables, among others.[48]In 2013, Gullit and many other former footballers were brought into EA Sports's FIFA 14 as "Legends" cards in FIFA Ultimate Team, his card is one of the highest rated in the game.[49]In 2014, Gullit joined BBC's Match of the Day as a studio pundit and first appeared during the 2014–15 season.[50]Gullit embarked on the Heineken Champions League Trophy Tour in 2016 where he visited Vietnam with Carles Puyol.[51]Gullit is a Feyenoord supporter.[52] His son Maxim Gullit plays for Cambuur.[53]All competitive league games (league and domestic cup) and international matches (including friendlies) are included.[57]HFC Haarlem[58]Feyenoord[58]PSV[58]AC Milan[58]Sampdoria[58]Netherlands[58]IndividualChelsea[58]"

Tom Rush;"Thomas Walker Rush (born February 8, 1941)[1] is an American folk and blues singer and songwriter.[2]Rush was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States,[1] the son of a teacher at St. Paul's School, in Concord, New Hampshire. He began performing in 1961 while studying at Harvard University,[1] after having graduated from the Groton School. He majored in English literature. Many of his early recordings are versions of Lowland Scots and Appalachian folk songs. He regularly performed at the Club 47 coffeehouse (now called Club Passim) in Cambridge, the Unicorn in Boston, and The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. In the 1970s he lived in Deering, New Hampshire.[3]Rush is credited by Rolling Stone magazine with ushering in the era of the singer-songwriter. In addition to performing his own compositions, he sang songs by Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Murray McLauchlan, David Wiffen and William Hawkins, helping them to gain recognition early in their careers.His 1968 composition "No Regrets" has become a standard,[1] with numerous cover versions having been recorded (Rush did two radically different versions himself).  These include The Walker Brothers, who gave Tom Rush Top Ten credit as a songwriter on the UK Singles Chart, Emmylou Harris, who included the song on her 1988 album Bluebird, and Midge Ure whose cover also made the UK Top Ten.[1]On March 1, 2007 a video of his performance of Steven Walters' "The Remember Song" was uploaded to YouTube, and, as of April 2017, it has received over 7 million plays. Writing on his website, Rush said,I've been waiting 45 years to be an overnight sensation, and it's finally happened! A video clip of my performance of "The Remember Song" has 'gone viral'. I felt terrible at first, thinking I was being accused of being a musical equivalent of Ebola, but my children explained to me that this was a good thing.One of the earliest music videos produced (1968) for an artist by a record company, Elektra, can be found at his website. It was used to promote his signature song, "No Regrets", for his The Circle Game album. A number of recent videos from a 2010 concert performed in Old Saybrook, Connecticut can be found online.Tom Rush is married to author Renée Askins and was formerly married to singer Beverly Rush.Over the years Rush has used a number of guitars on stage, his current primary one being a handcrafted acoustic made by Don Musser. In February 2012, Rush appeared on stage in Colorado with a new instrument, a cedar-top Dreadnought with an inlay of a snake wrapped around a reclining nude woman. The guitar, crafted by McKenzie & Marr Guitars is a "re-incarnation" of one of Rush's earliest acoustics, the famous "Naked Lady".On December 28, 2012, Rush appeared at Boston Symphony Hall to celebrate fifty years in the music business.Rush's latest album Voices was released in 2018. In recent years, he has frequently toured the United States, often accompanied on piano by Berklee graduate Matt Nakoa.[4][5][6]"

Dukus Horant;"Dukus Horant is a 14th-century narrative poem in Judeo-German (Proto-Yiddish).Dukus Horant is the best known of a number of works which survive in the Cambridge Codex T.-S.10.K.22. This manuscript was discovered in the Cairo Geniza in 1896, and contains a collection of narrative poems in a variant of Middle High German, written in Hebrew characters. There is some controversy over the extent to which the manuscript's language differs from the commonly spoken German of the time, but it is agreed there is a strong Jewish colouring to it. Therefore, these are the oldest known works (apart from a few short inscriptions dated to the 13th century) in the Ashkenazi Jewish vernacular which later developed into Yiddish.Dukus Horant is a heroic epic with thematic similarities to the German poem Kudrun.  It is thus a good example of the transfer of literary material between the Christian and Jewish communities in the German-speaking lands in the later Middle Ages, by contrast, the other works in the manuscript contain traditional Jewish material.The poem tells how Duke Horant is sent by King Etene to Greece, probably to Constantinople, to win the hand of the princess Hilde. However Hilde's father, the fierce Greek king Hagen, is not willing to give his daughter to Etene until Horant has proved his prowess in a series of adventures.Dukus Horant is composed in four-line rhymed strophes, the first and second line of each strophe being distichal. Though distichal verse forms are typical of classical Hebrew verse, these are more closely reminiscent of the distichal forms of old Germanic heroic verse. The language and form can be seen from the following transcription of the opening strophe, given first in the original (Hebrew characters and transliterated), then in a normalized Middle High German version by Dunphy."
2006–2008 Bangladeshi political crisis;"Anti-government factions Caretaker government of BangladeshThe 2006–2008 Bangladeshi political crisis began as a caretaker government (CTG) assumed power at the end of October 2006 following the end of term of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party administration. BNP government increased the age of chief justice retirement in an unconstitutional way to bias the appointment of the head of the caretaker government. CTG manages the government during the interim 90-day period and parliamentary elections. Political conflict began with the alleged appointment of a Chief Advisor, a role which devolved to the President, Dr. Iajuddin Ahmed. The interim period was marked from the beginning by violent protests initiated by the Awami League named Logi Boitha Andolan (Boat-hook and Oar Movement), with 40 people killed and hundreds injured in the first month.[1] The Bangladesh Nationalist Party had its own complaints about the process and the opposition.After extensive negotiations as the CTG tried to bring all the political parties to the table and had agreement for a scheduled election, on 3 January 2007, the Awami League said that it and the smaller parties of its Grand Alliance would boycott the general election to be held on 22 January 2007. They complained about the lack of an accurate voters list. More widespread violence and political rioting followed.[1]The "bitter rivalry" between the Awami League and BNP has affected the nation for the last two decades, although their political positions are not so far apart.[1] The parties are led by women who represent assassinated leaders: Sheikh Hasina, the eldest daughter of father of the nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, since 1981 has been head of the Awami League. Khaleda Zia, the head of the BNP, is the widow of the late president Ziaur Rahman, who as president founded the party in the late 1970s.On 11 January 2007 the military intervened to support the caretaker government of President Iajuddin, who had already declared a state of emergency. He accepted the resignations of most of his advisors. He also resigned as Chief Advisor, being replaced on 12 January by Fakhruddin Ahmed, who had worked for the World Bank. The government suppressed political activity to try to restore stability. In the spring, it started to work on corruption cases, charging 160 persons, including both party leaders, other politicians, civil servants and businessmen for actions going back to the late 1990s. The nation has had an extreme reputation for corruption under both the major political parties. In addition, some observers speculated that the caretaker government was trying to force both party leaders into exile to stabilise the country and reduce the political polarisation. The CTG also charged Sheikh Hasina for alleged murder for the deaths of four persons during protests in the fall of 2006. The High Court held that Khaleda Zia could not be charged under emergency law for events that happened prior to the emergency but on appeal, in September 2007 the Bangladesh Supreme Court ruled that the Zia trial should proceed. Near the end of 2008, the caretaker government moved to restore democratic government and held elections in December. The Awami League and Grand Alliance won by a two-thirds majority, and formed a government in 2009.According to Bangladesh's unique system, at the time of national parliamentary elections, which must be held within ninety days of dissolving a parliament, a caretaker government is entrusted to oversee the process and manage in the interim. First established in an informal way, the CTG provisions were incorporated by amendment in 1996 into the constitution. It stipulates that the Chief Advisor position (with the status of Prime Minister) is filled by the appointment of the last retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He appoints a maximum of ten advisors (with the status of ministers) to assist in managing the government. The caretaker government runs all the state's affairs during the 90-day interim, including conducting the nationwide parliamentary elections. During this interim period, the Defense Ministry's charge is transferred to the country's President of Bangladesh, who assumes the role of Commander-in-Chief.At the end of BNP's 2001–2006 term, the Awami League questioned the neutrality of K. M. Hasan, the immediate past Chief Justice, who was in line to become Chief Advisor of the caretaker government. With uncertainty about who would be appointed as CA, Awami supporters led protests and violence beginning on 28 October, popularly known as the logi boitha movement, which resulted in at least 12 deaths and thousands of injuries. On that day, Awami League activists allegedly beat and killed members of an opposing party.[2][3][4][5][6]At the backdrop against the situation, the former Chief Justice K. M. Hasan declined to take the job of Chief Advisor (CA), citing health reasons. However, according to the provision, the constitutional obligations must be performed without fear and favour. Hindering this sacred responsibility is deemed to be serious violation of the constitution, which is to be punished in highest order.According to a BDNews24 report based on later Wikileaks, Justice Hasan had started recruiting advisors before he was sworn in.[7] President Iajuddin Ahmed directed his Presidential Advisor to organise meetings with the four major political parties representing parliament, but the parties were unable to agree on an appointment for Chief Advisor, although five men were considered.Justice Mainur Reza Chowdhury was discussed as a nominee, but he died before appointment. Two retired justices of the Supreme Court: Justice M. A. Aziz and Justice Md. Hamidul Haque, were also considered. Aziz was Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) at that time. The Awami League complained about him in that position, so did not accept him for CA. Justice Haq was disqualified as he had been appointed Chairman of the Judicial Training Institute by the immediate past BNP government. Having held a for-profit office is a disqualification for the CA. In addition, BNP opposed his nomination as CA.Justice Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury was considered. He had retired before Mainur Reza Chowdhury. The BNP opposed him, as the Parliamentary Adviser of Khaleda Zia was against him. In August 2012, The Daily Star reported that Khaleda Zia has said she regretted having opposed Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury's appointment at the time.[8]Given the parties' failure to agree on a candidate, according to the constitution the position devolved to the President, Iajuddin Ahmed, serving since 2002. He took it on in addition to his regular responsibilities, which under the caretaker government included the Defense Ministry. Iajuddin Ahmed formed a government, appointing ten advisors to a council to act as ministers. He appointed his press spokesman, the journalist Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, as his chief Presidential Advisor, with the status of Minister of State. Chowdhury had the responsibility to negotiate with the political parties to bring them to participation in the election.The Awami League agreed to take part in the elections, but demanded that Iajuddin Ahmed make mass changes to the administration to free it from what they called the BNP's politicisation. They also demanded that a new and accurate voter list be compiled. The BNP also had its own issues against the opposition. Hussain Muhammad Ershad, head of the Jatiya Party allied with BNP, asked the CTG not to extend date of submission of nominations for candidates, as requested by Awami League, as his candidates had filed on time. At Sheikh Hasina's demand, a presidential advisor negotiated with the Election Commission to gain a two-day extension for filing of nominations[9] On 23 December 2006, all political parties joined the planned elections of 22 January 2007. The last day of nomination filing was extended to 26 December 2006 to accommodate all political parties, as requested by Sheikh Hasnna to Mukhles Chowdhury.On 3 January 2007, the last day possible, the Awami League declared that they and their allies would boycott the election. The withdrawal added to the political uncertainty and more violent protests resulted, in which hundreds had already been injured.[1] These actions had devastating, disruptive effects on the economy.[1]As the BBC noted,The two women [Hasina and Zia] are bitter rivals and barely speak to each other. Their mutual loathing is reflected among their respective sets of supporters.Bangladesh is one of the most politically polarised countries in the world, even though the actual policy differences between the two largest parties do not amount to anything significant.But the ceaseless bickering and violent confrontations have meant that the Bangladeshi economy – already fragile – is coming under further pressure.[1]Military representatives met with President Ahmed on 11 January, urging him to declare a state of emergency, and to resign and appoint an Interim Chief Advisor.[10][11] According to a United States diplomatic cable later released under Wikileaks, the Army Chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, and his group persuaded the President to declare a state of emergency on 11 January 2007.[11][12] At the time, the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence & Counterterrorism, Brigadier General A T M Amin, met with the US Ambassador, Patricia Butenis, to explain the military's concerns. Given the Awami League's withdrawal from the elections, they believed that supporting a one-sided election might threaten the armed forces continued participation in UN peacekeeping missions – UNPKO, which they valued. In addition, they were worried about threatened terrorist violence from Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), which had set off 300 bombs in August 2005. They wanted a neutral government established until "fair, free and credible elections" could be held in which all parties participated.[10]In the near term, Justice Fazlul Haque, the senior CTG advisor, was to be appointed Interim Chief Advisor, and Fakhruddin Ahmed, a prominent banker, would quickly be appointed Chief Advisor to replace Iajuddin Ahmed. All of them were the violation of the constitution and when chief advisor or prime minister resigns the whole advisory council or cabinet is deemed to be resigned what Advisor Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury categorically pointed out. Mukhles Chowdhury also deleted some sentences, which were derogated remarks against the country to justify the military intervention, written by Lt. Gen. Moeen in the president's speech broadcast on 11 January 2011. Moeen's main pillar of 11 January 2007 military coup was then Military Secretary to the President (MSP) Major General Aminul Karim.[12]Due to this, Advisor Mukhles Chowdhury attempted to replace him by then General Officer Commanding (GOC) of 24 Division Major General Md Abdul Mubeen, who was later appointed as army chief by successive government. Unfortunately, DG of Special Security Force (SSF) Major General Syed Fatemi Ahmed Rumi supported Aminul Karim and misled former prime minister Khaleda Zia on this. Initially. Mrs Zia was convinced by Advisor Chowdhury, but later she took side of Rumi. But what she did not realise that once loyal this army officer had already betrayed with her. Although Rumi was posted long five years of Khaleda Zia's tenure with her, she was under surveillance by him as well. During those days, he intercepted her personal life. Ironically, an army group including him, tried to publish a Nikahnama (marriage document) of his once boss in Prothom Alo, a bangla daily. Fatemi Rumi accompanied General Moeen to his maiden visit to India, he was posted by Moeen to Rangpur division of army where Moeen visited three times and worked to establish a University in Rangpur. Moreover, Rumi pressured businessmen to contribute donation for the Kings Party "Jago Bangladesh" a political party created by Moeen, which dies a natural death. Likewise, when Mukhles Chowdhury informed top politicians that by 12 January 2011 there would be a martial law in Bangladesh, Brigadier Chowdhury Fazlul Bari misled Khaleda Zia with the help of Aminul Karim to implement Moeen's plan to capture Presidency. In addition, Amin (popularly known as Bihari Amin as he was a settler from India's Bihar Province) informed the US diplomats that the Director General for National Security Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Md. Rezzaqul Haider Chowdhury (Haider), was relieved from duty and being investigated. (Later that year, he was charged in the 10-Truck Arms and Ammunition Haul in Chittagong, an incident of smuggling to a militant organisation based in India.) The President's remaining CTG advisor, M Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, was also relieved of his duties. The cable noted that both men were believed to be paths of influence from Khaleda Zia and the BNP.[10]Assuring the diplomats of the military's support for the civilian government, Amin said their immediate goals for the caretaker government were to:The BBC reported on 11 January 2007 that, given the withdrawal of the Awami League, and announced resignations, the United Nations and the European Union immediately suspended their election monitoring operations, as conditions for a credible vote did not exist.[13] The EU said,The European Commission has decided to suspend its Election Observation Mission (EOM) to Bangladesh covering the parliamentary elections on 22nd January. The European Commission has recalled the long-term observers already on the ground, and will not deploy the other phases of its observation mission, which was due to be led by MEP Alexander Graf Lambsdorff.[14]A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said,The political crisis in Bangladesh has severely jeopardised the legitimacy of the electoral process.  The announced cancellation of numerous international observation missions is regrettable. The United Nations has had to suspend all technical support to the electoral process, including by closing its International Coordination Office for Election Observers in Dhaka.[15]On the same day as the UN and EU withdrawal, Chief Advisor Iajuddin Ahmed announced a state of emergency in Bangladesh. He established a late night to early morning (11 p.m. to 5 am) curfew. The Economist reported this action as a form of coup d'état.[16] Within hours President Ahmed announced his resignation as chief advisor and postponed the scheduled election. Prior to his resignation, he accepted the resignations of nine of the ten advisors of the caretaker government.President Ahmed appointed Justice Fazlul Haque, the senior-ranking CTG advisor, as the interim Chief Advisor. The columnist Zafar Sobhan of the Daily Star newspaper wrote, "It is fairly apparent that it was done under pressure from the army because of the threat that the country could lose its peacekeeping role" with the United Nations, which was both prestigious and lucrative in terms of payment to the country.[17]On 12 January 2007, with military backing, the former Bangladesh Bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed, who had worked for the World Bank, was sworn in as the new Chief Advisor. He appointed five advisors on 13 January to form the new interim government. When he was officially named as the head of the caretaker government, he lifted the curfew.[18] The state of emergency was continued, suspending some basic rights provided by the constitution, such as the freedom of movement, assembly, and speech to limit protests and disruptive political activity.[19]In 2007, the caretaker government pursued graft and corruption charges against both major party leaders and some of their senior staff, trying to clean up the country, which was notorious for corruption. It filed charges against 160 politicians, civil servants, and businessmen, including Tareque and Arafat Rahman, two sons of the former prime minister, Khaleda Zia, who were both active in the BNP.[20] Later in the year, the government filed charges of corruption against both her and Sheikh Hasina, leader of the Awami League. This anti-corruption effort was greeted with approval by the people, who were tired of government officials "siphoning off the country's wealth."[20]In April, the media reported that the caretaker government was trying to force both major party leaders out of the country, which was needed to reform the political system.[20] Supporters of Khaleda Zia were negotiating for her to go to Saudi Arabia, but that country declined.[20] The CTG banned Sheikh Hasina from returning from a trip and had prohibited political activity. By 26 April 2007, the government had changed its position, and allowed Hasina to return and both leaders to resume political activities. Hasina was being charged with murder for the deaths of four opposition supporters in late 2006, allegedly due to attacks by her party members, prior to the state of emergency being imposed.[20]On 12 July 2007, Sheikh Hasina, party leader of the Awami League, was arrested for graft, based on charges filed by a businessman against her for actions in 1998.[21]After holding power for more than a year, the CTG decided to hold local elections in some locations on 4 August 2008. The main parties criticised this as unconstitutional.[22] General elections were held on 29 December 2008, when the Awami League and its Grand Alliance won two-thirds of the seats in parliament. The BNP and its four-party alliance, including Jamaat-e-Islami, comprise the major opposition."

Shabda Brahman;"Shabda Brahman or Sabda-brahman or Nada brahman means transcendental sound (Shatapatha Brahmana III.12.48) or sound vibration (Shatpatha Brahmana Vi.16.51) or the transcendental sound of the Vedas (Shatpatha Brahmana  Xi.21.36) or of Vedic scriptures (Shatpatha Brahmana X.20.43).[1] Shabda or sabda stands for word manifested by sound ('verbal') and such a word has innate power to convey a particular sense or meaning (Artha). According to the Nyaya and the Vaisheshika schools, Shabda means verbal testimony, to the Sanskrit grammarians, Yaska, Panini and Katyayana it meant a unit of language or speech or vac. In the philosophical terms this word appears for the first time in the Maitri Upanishad (Sloka VI.22) that speaks of two kinds of Brahman - Shabda Brahman ('Brahman with sound') and Ashabda Brahman ('soundless Brahman'). Bhartrhari speaks about the creative power of shabda, the manifold universe is a creation of Shabda Brahman (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad IV.i.2). Speech is equated with Brahman (Shatpatha Brahmana 2.1.4.10).The Rig Veda states that Brahman extends as far as Vāc (R.V.X.114.8), and has hymns in praise of Speech as the Creator (R.V.X.71.7) and as the final abode of Brahman (R.V.I.164.37). Time is the creative power of Shabda Brahman.[2][3]Purva Mimamsa deals with Shabda Brahman ('cosmic sound or word') which is endowed with names and forms and is projected in vedic revelations (the mantras, hymns, prayers etc.). Vedanta deals with Parama Brahman ('the Ultimate Reality') which is transcendent and devoid of material names and material forms. One has to become well established in Shabda Brahman before realizing Parama Brahman. Vedas are not the product of conventional language but the emanation of reality in form of Shabda (sound, word) which is the sole cause of creation and is eternal. Purva Mimamsa, an esoteric discipline, from the point of view of spiritual growth aims at attaining the heavenly happiness by realizing Shabda Brahman (cosmic sound) by conducting yajnas that help control the senses and the mind, when the mind and the senses are subdued the inner subtle sound is realized as Shabda Brahman. [4]The fundamental theory of Indian classical music, art and poetry is grounded in the theory of Nada Brahman or Shabda Brahman, and is linked with the Vedic religion.[5] The Apara Brahman mentioned by Mandukya Upanishad is Nada Brahman or Shabda Brahman. Shiva Samhita states that whenever and wherever there is causal stress or Divine action, there is vibration (spandan or kampan), and wherever there is vibration or movement there sound (Shabda) is inevitable. "M" of Aum, the primordial vac represents shabda which is the root and essence of everything, it is Pranava and Pranava is Vedas, Vedas are Shabda Brahman. Consciousness in all beings is Shabda Brahman.[6]When the necessity of directing the Mantra (identical to Ishta) internally and to objects externally is transcended then one gains Mantra chaitanya which then awakens  Atman chaitanya, the Divine Consciousness, and unites with it. The Mantra is Shabda Brahman and Ishta is the light of Consciousness. The prana, body and mind along with the entire universe, are all expressions of Mantra chaitanya. At the ultimate level of Shabda Brahman transcendental words (Nama-Brahman, Holy name) become materially wordless, transcendental forms become materially formless (rise from lower gunas to higher and transformed from material sattva to transcendental shuddha-sattva) and all multiplicity unified in Consciousness residing in that transcendent glory extends beyond mind and speech.[7]In the Bhagavad Gita (Sloka VI.44) the term Shabda Brahman has been used to mean Vedic injunctions. Adi Shankara explains that the Yogic impressions do not perish even when held up for a long period, even he who seeks to comprehend the essence of Yoga and begins to tread the path of Yoga goes beyond the spheres of the fruits of Vedic works, he sets them aside. [8] In this context Srimad Bhagavatam (Sloka III.33.7) has also been relied upon to high-light the disregard of Vedic rituals by the advanced transcendentalists. [9] Gaudapada clarifies that the letter "a" of Aum leads to Visva, the letter "u"" leads to Taijasa and the letter "m" leads to Prajna. With regard to one freed from letters, there remains no attainment (Mandkya Karika I.23). Aum is Shabda Brahman, Aum is the Root Sound of which creation is a series of permutations.[10]According to the Tantric concept, Sound is the first manifestation of Parama Shiva, in its primary stage it is a psychic wave. Its very existence entails the presence of spandan or movement ('vibration') without which there cannot be sound, spandan is the quality of Saguna brahman and the world is the thought-projection of Saguna Shiva. The first sutra of Sarada Tilaka explains the significance and hidden meaning of Shabda Brahman.[11]"
Derrick Dowell;"Derrick Dowell (born September 8, 1965) is an American former professional basketball player.Dowell emerged as a promising prospect while playing for Benjamin Bosse High School in his hometown of Evansville, Indiana, leading his team to a 51–2 record during his final two years with the team.[1][2] He played collegiately with the USC Trojans while earning two first-team All-Pac-10 nominations in his final two seasons.Dowell was selected in the 1987 NBA draft by the Washington Bullets as the 37th overall pick although he never played in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Mean Ameen;"Mean Ameen is an album by American jazz saxophonist Ernest Dawkins' New Horizons Ensemble, which was recorded in 2004 and released on Delmark. It was a tribute to New Horizons' trumpeter Ameen Muhammad, who died in 2003 at the age of 48.[1]In his review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow states "These musicians are clearly talented in several styles, play with open minds, and react quickly to each other's ideas."[2]The Penguin Guide to Jazz says "All in all, a fine album, well crafted and full of excellent solo playing. If it's not quite up to previous offerings, the cover portrait of the missing Muhammad goes some way to explaining why."[3]The All About Jazz review by Rex Butters says "Delmark's sound—clean, live, and rough—delivers the broad tonal options employed by the ensemble. With Mean Ameen, Dawkins and company have created a 21st century hard-bop maelstrom."[4]In his review for JazzTimes Chris Kelsey notes "The performances are fairly straight-ahead but enormously creative within slightly loosened conventions of small group jazz."[5]"
Rusty Young (musician);"Norman Russell Young (February 23, 1946 – April 14, 2021)[1] was an American guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, best known as one of the frontmen in the influential country rock and Americana band Poco.A virtuoso on pedal steel guitar, he was celebrated for the ability to get a Hammond B3 organ sound out of the instrument by playing it through a Leslie speaker cabinet and as an innovator of producing other rock sounds from the instrument.[2][3]Young was born in Long Beach, California and raised in Colorado.[4] He began playing lap steel guitar at age 6, and taught guitar and steel guitar lessons during his high school years at Jefferson High School, Lakewood, Colorado with George Grantham. During that time, he also played country music in late night bars. Young played in a well known Denver psychedelic rock band "Boenzee Cryque".[5]In the late 1960s, an acquaintance of Young's, Miles Thomas, became the road manager for Buffalo Springfield. Richie Furay and Jim Messina needed a steel guitarist for the Furay ballad "Kind Woman" on their final album Last Time Around and after Thomas told Young about the opportunity, Young was hired. [6] Along with Furay and Messina, Young became a founding member of Poco in 1968 upon the former band's demise. Drummer George Grantham and bass player Randy Meisner rounded out the original Poco lineup.[5] The band's membership fluctuated over the years. After Furay left the group, Young took on more song writing responsibility, along with Paul Cotton and Timothy B. Schmit. Young is best known for writing the Poco songs "Rose of Cimarron" and "Crazy Love". In 2013, Young was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame.[7] At the end of 2013, Young announced his retirement,[8] but it turned out that it was a short-lived retirement.A few shows were booked into 2014 including three farewell shows in Florida. One of those shows was a performance in a recording studio in front of a live audience for a DVD document of the band's live show.[citation needed] Young said there could be some one-offs in the future after that, but the band would not be actively touring as before.[citation needed] Young and Jack Sundrud wrote and recorded music for children's story videos as the "Session Cats".[9] Young continued to do guest performances with former members of Poco and other country rock artists. Young released his first solo album in 2017 on Blue Élan Records,Waitin' For The Sun. Young released his first new music since Waitin' for the Sun on March 22, 2019. The new tune, "Listen to Your Heart", was released digitally and benefited a local Steelville, Missouri animal charity, Santana's Hope for Paws (Friends of Steelville, MO Pound) Animal Shelter.[10]Young died of a heart attack on April 14, 2021.

The Sentinel (Konvitz novel);"The Sentinel (1974) is a novel written by Jeffrey Konvitz.Alison Parker, a beautiful but troubled fashion model, moves into a gorgeous New York City brownstone house that is divided into apartments. The house is inhabited on the top floor by Father Francis Matthew Halloran, a reclusive blind Catholic priest who spends his time sitting at his open window.Alison is romantically involved with Michael Farmer, a lawyer and former prosecutor. Alison's life is beset for a number of reasons. She had a horrible relationship with her recently deceased father and survived at least one suicide attempt. Michael is under suspicion in the death of his former wife. A determined New York City Police Department detective named Gatz is sure that Michael murdered her and soon comes to suspect Alison as well.Alison suffers sleep loss and horrible nightmares involving her father and soon begins to suffer blinding headaches.Looking for distraction, she tries to ingratiate herself with the building's other occupants - but finds that they are bizarrely eccentric and obnoxious. Alison complains about them to the building's real estate agent. The agent is confused, telling a shocked Alison that there are no neighbours - besides herself and Father Halloran, no one else lives there.Looking for answers, Michael breaks into a records archive of the Roman Catholic Church. Researching the past of Father Halloran, Michael learns that the man has none. Rather, Halloran's life "began" the day that another man's life apparently ended, leading Michael to believe that the two men are one and the same. He also finds similar records for a woman, a nun named Sister Therese who is to reside in Alison's building. Michael soon concludes that Sister Therese is actually the woman that Alison is meant to become.Rushing to her building, he confronts the blind priest, only to be killed. Returning to the building, her headaches having returned and her skin beginning to desiccate, Alison finds Michael seemingly unhurt. He reveals that he is actually dead and also damned for killing his wife. He also explains that the house is actually positioned over the gateway between our world and Hell and that there must be a gatekeeper to protect the world from the denizens of the Underworld. Until now, that gatekeeper, or Sentinel, had been Father Halloran, but Alison is now expected to succeed him. Her troubled past, especially her suicide attempt, make her the appropriate choice. The inhabitants of Hell are actually her fellow "neighbours" and they know that they have one chance to escape the Abyss - pressuring Alison to complete her suicide. At the last minute, Father Halloran appears and saves Alison, driving the "neighbours" back to hell.The book ends with Alison becoming the new Sentinel, Sister Therese, who is blind like Father Halloran before her.The book was adapted into a film, also titled The Sentinel and also written by Konvitz. Konvitz wrote a sequel novel titled The Guardian (1979) which, as yet, has received no film adaptation."

Anti (album);" Anti (stylised in all caps) is the eighth studio album by Barbadian singer Rihanna, released on 28 January 2016 by Roc Nation and Westbury Road. Rihanna started recording in 2014 after ending her contract with Def Jam Recordings, who had released all of her albums since her debut in 2005. As executive producer, Rihanna recorded Anti with producers including Jeff Bhasker, Boi-1da, DJ Mustard, Hit-Boy, Brian Kennedy, Timbaland and No I.D., at studios in Canada, the United States and France. SZA and Drake contribute guest vocals.Conceived when Rihanna was experiencing creative struggles and emotional turmoil, Anti features an atmospheric production characterised by lo-fi beats, distorted vocals and downtempo arrangements. The first half consists of bass-heavy tracks, and the second is characterised by textured minimalism. Compared to the radio-friendly dance tunes of her previous albums, Anti is an alternative R&B, pop and dancehall album, more muted and soulful. Its songs explore eclectic styles spanning hip hop, soul, psychedelic, doo-wop, country, synth-rock and trap. Their lyrics are about the emotions ensued from love and relationships, from endearment and desire to betrayal and liberation, with references to sex, drugs and alcohol.The promotional campaign for Anti from summer 2014 comprised prolonged release delays and a $25 million deal with Samsung. Rihanna announced the cover art and title at the MAMA Gallery on 7 October 2015. The Anti World Tour ran from March to November 2016, and four songs were released as singles, including the US Billboard Hot 100 number one "Work". In the United States, Anti is Rihanna's second number-one album and the first album by a black woman to spend 300 weeks on the Billboard 200. The album topped charts in Canada and Norway, and peaked in the top five on charts in such European countries as Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.In contemporary publications, critics commended the album's emotional honesty but were divided on the production, praise centering on Rihanna's newfound musical freedom and criticism on the unfocused track list. Some took issue with the lack of radio-friendly songs, but others noted the musical shift marked Rihanna's artistic maturity as an album artist beyond her status as a pop star. At the 2017 Grammy Awards, the album and its singles received six nominations, including one for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Anti featured on 2010s decade-end lists by such publications as Billboard, NME and Pitchfork. It ranked 230th on Rolling Stone's 2020 edition of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.Barbadian singer Rihanna's seventh studio album, Unapologetic, was released on 19 November 2012, by Def Jam Recordings.[1] Unapologetic combines urban and R&B with radio-friendly pop tunes and dubstep influences, and its lyrics are about Rihanna's sexual autonomy and emotional struggles.[2][3] Critics likened the sound and themes of Unapologetic's to those of her previous albums, namely Rated R (2009), Loud (2010) and Talk that Talk (2011).[4][5] She embarked on the Diamonds World Tour to promote the album in 2013, and co-headlined the Monster Tour with American rapper Eminem in 2014.[6] After touring, Rihanna intended to take a year off to "just do whatever [she wanted] artistically, creatively", but reportedly started recording new music as soon as October 2014.[7][8]Unapologetic was Rihanna's last album under Def Jam, who had released all of her discography since her first album, Music of the Sun (2005).[9] In March 2014, she signed with American rapper Jay-Z's Roc Nation after leaving Def Jam and gaining the right to her album masters,[9] Jay-Z was her mentor when she first moved from Barbados to the United States.[10][11] Up to that point, Rihanna had released one studio album each year from 2005 to 2012 (with the exception of 2008), totalling seven.[12]In an interview with MTV News in March 2015, Rihanna said she wanted her eighth album to be "soulful" and "timeless", having found the "really, really big songs" on her past albums had fallen out of her taste, "I wanted an album that I could perform in 15 years. ... Not any songs that were burnt out."[13] The record was initially to be executive-produced by rapper-producer Kanye West, who had produced the single "FourFiveSeconds" (January 2015) and recorded it with Rihanna and English musician Paul McCartney, but the plan fell through.[14] Although Rihanna wanted the record to represent her authentic self, feeling "numb" and disconnected from her emotions, she experienced an emotional turmoil.[15] Speaking with Sarah Paulson for the October 2019 issue of Interview, Rihanna talked about her spiritual wellbeing while making Anti: "I have been in a place where I felt like maybe I had disappointed god so much that we weren't as close."[16]The album's recording sessions took place at various studios including the Jungle City Studios in New York City, Westlake Recording Studios, Sandra Gale Studios and Windmark Recording Studios in Los Angeles, SOTA Studios in Toronto and Twin Studios in Paris.[17] Most of the songs were recorded at the Westlake Recording Studios.[17] Songwriter Bibi Bourelly had been working with producer Paperboy Fabe, who arranged a session with West. The result was the song "Higher". Later, Rihanna and James Fauntleroy also contributed to the song writing. "Higher" was recorded in the early morning hours while Rihanna was under the influence of alcohol. "We just said, 'You know what? Let's just drink some whiskey and record this song.'"[18] The song was described by Rihanna as "a drunk voice mail".[15] Rihanna and Fauntleroy also collaborated on three other songs – "Desperado", "Close to You," and "James Joint". The latter was written with Rihanna and Shea Taylor, who wrote the song in less than 30 minutes, while "Close To You" was written after producer Brian Kennedy sent Fauntleroy a piano music sample.[19]"Desperado" was written by Mick Shultz and Rook Monroe. After visiting Rihanna's home, Shultz was contacted a week later by the singer's team who stated that she really liked the record. Rihanna, Fauntleroy and Kuk Harrell, were all later involved in the song's development, production and recording.[20] In the summer of 2015, songwriter and producer Rupert Thomas together with Allen Ritter and Boi-1da among others, stayed at Canadian rapper's Drake house in Los Angeles for several days. During the time, the lead single, "Work" was conceived.[21] Thomas created the beat and played it for Boi-1da to which he positively responded. Boi-1da came up with the idea for sampling an "old school dancehall rhythm" after the chords were made. When the song's music was finished, Boi-1da sent it to PartyNextDoor who wrote the lyrics.[21]Two songs each were recorded at Jungle City Studios in New York City and Windmark Recording Studios in Los Angeles.[17] The studio sessions at Jungle City produced the opening track "Consideration" and "Kiss It Better". Rihanna stated when recording "Consideration", she felt a connection to it, stating the song captured the sound and attitude she was aiming for.[15] The recording sessions at Windmark Recording Studios produced the songs "Never Ending" and "Love on the Brain". The former was written by Chad Sabo during his time in California, where Sabo was playing with the band Basic Vacation. Sabo was in the band's van and began to write the intro riff that would become "Never Ending". Shortly after, he took the song home and attempted to bring the song together using a digital 8-track studio. He later worked on the song's lyrics and posted it onto the internet. The writing process of "Never Ending" began in November 2013, and started again in April 2014 at which time Rihanna became interested in the track and wanted to record it. English singer-songwriter Dido co-wrote it.[22]The only song which was recorded outside of the United States was "Same Ol' Mistakes", the track was recorded at the Twin Studios in Paris.[17] Rihanna's team contacted Tame Impala's management and informed them that Rihanna loved the band's song "New Person, Same Old Mistakes" and asked if she could re-record the track for Anti. The song's writer, Kevin Parker, agreed and gave Rihanna permission to record the song. After hearing Rihanna's version, Parker stated, "We're all really happy with how the song turned out, love it!".[23]American vocal producer Kuk Harrell, who has been working with Rihanna since 2007, stated that for Anti, Rihanna was creatively more involved in the making process. Harrell stated that she aimed to push the album in the direction she envisioned. The producer stated his attempt to move away from mainstream pop music when producing the album's vocals, "Every record... is a record that somebody else could've done... It's so awesome that she... was courageous enough to... do that."[24]Harrell noted that with the production of Anti Rihanna was far more meticulous about what she wanted each individual line to sound like. He stated that he attempted to work quickly when producing the album, however Rihanna wanted to constantly improve the album's quality stating, "let's up the quality level. Let's make sure... it's a masterpiece." Harrell stated that when he and Rihanna had previously worked together they aimed to make a great body of work, however on Anti they aimed to create a "masterpiece".[24]Speaking of the album's production and style, Harrell stated that artists such as Rihanna have been taking a stance and stepping away from the popular music of the time and the expectations of her label, directors, and radio, stating, "I don't want to make what everybody else is making... I know my fans will love it... if everybody else loves it, great. If they don't, at least I know... I've done what I want to do."[24] Anti was engineered by Nathaniel Alford, Chris Godbey, Harrell, Blake Mares, Daniela Rivera and Marcos Tovar. The album was finally mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound, in New York City.[17]On Anti... the focus is on that voice and her... personality, singing... as if her life depends on it.... what she has come up with is atmospheric, sexy and strangely disturbed, tapping into the kind of distorted beats and chilled tempos that burble through progressive hip hop. — Neil McCormick, discussing the album's musical and vocal style[25]During the album's recording Rihanna aimed to create a record to have "soulful" and "aggressive" sounds in the musical, lyrical and vocal context.[26] During a press conference in early 2014, Rihanna told MTV News that she aimed to depart from the musical style of her previous releases, which she described as being "big songs". Rihanna continued to state that with Anti she wanted to focus on music that "felt real" and soulful and would be timeless.[27] She also stated that she wanted to record songs that are "timeless" and that she could perform 15 years later. "Not any songs that were burnt out. I find that when I get on stage now, I don't want to perform a lot of my songs. They don't feel like me."[27]Anti abandons the radio-friendly dance-pop production of Rihanna's previous hit singles.[28][29] It is a genre-spanning record[30] consisting of pop and dancehall tunes[31][32] with elements of soul music.[33] Compared to Rihanna's previous catalogue, Anti is more muted and soulful.[34][35] According to Billboard, the album belongs to "the weeded-out, hazy spectrum of rap and alt-R&B".[36] Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture coined the term "industrial dancehall" as the most appropriate to describe Anti.[30] Ben Rayner of The Toronto Star stated the album is divided into two halves, the first consisting of "futuristic robo-R&B", while the second half contains "a more organic breed of soul".[33] The album's production has been characterized as being dark, sparsely layered,[37] bouncy, with lo-fi bass, old school styles,[32] downtempo moodiness and electro-soul minimalism.[33] The bass-heavy production of Anti's midsection ("Needed Me", "Woo", "Yeah, I Said It") evokes popular hip hop and R&B genres.[29] The second half of the album is characterised by textual minimalism.[38] Analyzing its sound a year after its release, Da'Shan Smith of Billboard noted the album's present underscoring of trap.[39]The album's lyrical content predominantly touches upon themes of relationships, exploring what it means to be in love, to get hurt, to need someone, and to be true to yourself.[37] The theme of relationships is picked up in numerous songs, "Kiss It Better" sees Rihanna questioning how far an ex-lover will go to get her back, in "Woo", Rihanna turns spiteful, stating she does not care for her ex-partner, while "Never Ending" features Rihanna admitting she would like to be in love again.[37] The album's themes were also noted as being unapologetic, with an uncaring attitude, and self-assurance.[32]Anti opens with "Consideration", a dub-inspired song. The song contains a "glitchy" production and features guest vocals from singer-songwriter SZA.[40] Neil McCormick of The Telegraph, thought the song is Rihanna turning her back on record labels and their expectations, in the line "I got to do things my own way darling".[41] "James Joint" is a neo-soul song that contains "keyboards built over rising bass riffs that create a thickly textured groove." The song was compared to the work of Stevie Wonder, due to the use of a harmonica.[42] "Kiss It Better" is a pop power ballad inspired by the music of the '80s and '90s.[40] Built over deep synths the track features an electric guitar and lyrics that focus on a destructive relationship that the singer knows is wrong for her, but one she finds irresistible.[25][43] "Work", which features Canadian rapper Drake, is a reggae-pop song[44] with a "percolating beat, sinuous synth lines, and vocal samples stretched and pulled in a way that recalls Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's production work on Janet Jackson's 1997 album The Velvet Rope."[45] "Desperado" is a moody, trap-country song containing a "mid-tempo groove, bell ringing and shuddering drums, along with deep synths and vocal samples."[25]The sixth track "Woo" opens with "two jarring, atonal guitar chords repeated along with small, trap-influenced percussion, over a basic riff."[43] It was compared to the work of Kanye West due to its slow stomping, distortion, and lack of melody and groove.[25] "Needed Me" is a downtempo song, with small elements of electro bubble, synthetic sounds, and a loose, casual vocal that discusses romantic rejection, while the following song "Yeah, I Said It" continues the trend of containing a slowed down groove.[25] "Same Ol' Mistakes" is a cover version of "New Person, Same Old Mistakes" (2015) performed by Tame Impala. The song contains the same production as the original, featuring a "fluid sound, with elements of psychedelic, hip-hop and pop-rock genres, along with a slow, dreamy, psychedelic synth groove."[25] "Never Ending" is a guitar-led song, with elements of country music, organic melodies and backing vocals.[46]"Love on the Brain" is a mid-tempo '50s inspired doo-wop ballad "that features a guitar arpeggio, swirling organ, simple chord progression and backing vocals".[25][43] Rihanna's vocals on the track were noted as being acrobatic and ranging from her "trademark snarl", to high notes, with dark lyrics that depict a destructive, yet addictive relationship.[43][46] "Higher" is a love song that has a woozy production that contains lyrics about Rihanna's feelings towards her lover whilst she is under the influence of drugs and alcohol.[25] "Close to You" is a slow piano ballad, which is sung in a jazz style.[25] The deluxe version of Anti contains three more songs. The first is "Goodnight Gotham", which contains an interpolation of "Only If for a Night" (2011) performed by Florence and the Machine and hears Rihanna singing along with the "looping" sample.[47] The following track "Pose" features a grimy beat, along with the singer aggressively boasting about her riches.[47] "Sex with Me" contains dreamy production which hears Rihanna talking about her beauty, "before closing with a trippy blend of vocals."[47]"I sometimes fear that I am misunderstood.It is simply because what I want to say,what I need to say, won't be heard.Heard in a way I so rightfully deserve.What I choose to say is of so much substanceThat people just won't understand the depth of my message.So my voice is not my weakness,It is the opposite of what others are afraid of.My voice is my suit and armor,My shield, and all that I am.I will comfortably breathe in it, until I find the moment to be silent.I live loudly in my mind, so many hours of the day.The world is pin drop sound compared to the boomThat thumps and bumps against the walls of my cranium.I live it and love it and despise it and I am entrapped in it.So being misunderstood, I am not offended by the gesture, but honored.If they let us..."—Rihanna and Chloe Mitchell, a reading of the album's artwork poem[48]On 7 October 2015, Rihanna held a private viewing for fans and press at Los Angeles' MAMA Gallery, where she debuted the album's official artwork and title. Initially thought to have been entitled R8, Rihanna announced the official title during the album's cover art release, revealing the album would be called ANTI. The exhibition included a piece of art which defined the album's title, stating that anti is "a person opposed to a particular policy, activity or idea."[49] Following the exhibition, Rihanna took to social media to confirm the album's title along with an explanation of its meaning. The explanation stated, "By continuing to follow her own instincts, her work strives to make an impact by doing the very antithesis of what the public expects."[50]The artwork was designed by Israeli artist Roy Nachum, and was described by Rihanna as her "favorite album cover".[51] The album's front cover shows an image of Rihanna, which was taken on her first day of day care,[52] holding a black balloon, with a gold crown covering her eyes, the majority of the artwork is black and white with a "smattering" of red paint.[51] Speaking about the cover art's concept, Nachum stated that he painted a young Rihanna to represent her "bringing something new" to music.[53]Over the red, black, and white canvas, there is a poem written in Braille by poet Chloe Mitchell. Speaking on her choice to use the language, Rihanna commented, "Sometimes the ones who have sight are the blindest."[51] During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they "drank" and came up with a poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled If They Let Us.[48] Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to Rolling Stone magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still being able to stand out while doing what is right for you. She further said that the poem speaks about not conforming to society and being a leader as well as accepting that being misunderstood is a positive thing.[53]At the gallery, the album's back cover, along with multiple inside album artworks were revealed. The album's back cover features the same image this time from behind.[54] The seven pieces of artwork were all named and featured a poem written by Mitchell or Nachum, the front and back covers were titled "If They Let Us Part I" and "If They Let Us Part II" and featured a poem that was split over the front and back. Another piece entitled "If They Let Us" was commissioned and featured the full reading of the poem.[55] The inside booklet contains a further five pieces entitled "Fire Part I", "Fire Part II", "Fire Part III" and "R".[55] Billboard ranked the artwork as one of the best covers of the albums released in 2016 and wrote, "What's black and white and red all over? One of the most intoxicating albums of any genre in 2016, with an equally indelible lead image to match."[56]"Work" featuring Canadian rapper Drake was released on 27 January 2016, hours before the Tidal release of Anti. Rihanna stated on Twitter that the song is the "first single" from her album.[57] "Work" debuted at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It became Rihanna's 27th top ten hit. With this feat, Rihanna tied Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson and Elton John as the artists with fifth-most top ten songs on the chart.[58] The singer reached 27 top ten singles on the Hot 100 in a span of 10 years and eight months between her first song, "Pon de Replay" and "Work" and became the fastest solo artist to reach the plateau.[59] In its fourth week, "Work" peaked at number one on the Hot 100 chart and became Rihanna's fourteenth number-one song in the United States and the 1,052nd number-one single on the chart overall. Subsequently, she became the artist with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart following the Beatles with 20 and Carey with 19, and Elvis Presley with 17. She broke a tie with Michael Jackson, who had reached 13 chart-toppers on the Billboard Hot 100.[60]On 29 March 2016, Rihanna announced that "Needed Me" and "Kiss It Better" would both be serviced to radio the following day as the album's second and third singles.[61] "Needed Me" saw far greater success becoming Rihanna's 28th top ten single on the Hot 100, tying her with Stevie Wonder for fourth place as the acts with the most top tens in Billboard history.[62] It notably became her longest charting Hot 100 hit, surpassing the 41-week run of "We Found Love".[63] "Kiss It Better" was a moderate success charting at the lower end of the US Billboard Hot 100, initially released as the promotional focus at pop radio, "Kiss It Better" reached as far as number twenty-four on the Pop Songs chart, leading Roc Nation to release "Needed Me"—an initially "urban radio priority"—to pop radio as well, due to its success.[64]On 21 August 2016, Rihanna announced via her Instagram account that "Love on the Brain" will be the next single. Prior to being announced as a single, "Love on the Brain" debuted on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number 30 and charted on the Billboard Hot 100, debuting at number 83.[65] After being released as a single, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 80.[66] The song peaked at number five, becoming the third top ten single from Anti, as well as her twenty-second top five hit.[67]Rihanna started a social media promotional campaign with the hashtag "#R8" as soon as summer 2014, her social media posts included pictures taken with record producers in studios.[7] From January to April 2015, Rihanna released three singles—"FourFiveSeconds" featuring Kanye West and Paul McCartney, "Bitch Better Have My Money", and "American Oxygen"—none of which made the track listing of Anti.[68] Rihanna also posted an interlude entitled "James Joint" in its entirety from the upcoming album on her website on 21 April 2015, as a "celebration of 420".[69]In October 2015, it was revealed that Rihanna had acquired the masters to all her recordings and would be releasing Anti jointly through her own record label Westbury Road and Roc Nation.[70]In November 2015, it was announced that Rihanna had signed a $25 million contract with Samsung to not only promote the Galaxy line of products, but to also sponsor the release of Anti and its supporting tour.[71] On 19 November 2015, Rihanna and Samsung released a 16-second cryptic video for Anti, launching a website for Rihanna's forthcoming album entitled "ANTIdiaRy". Upon launch, the mobile-only site gave messages, such as "She's waiting for you. Are you in?" and "Be patient and keep your eyes open".[72] The website then proceeded to launch eight "rooms" over the following 9 weeks, each loosely corresponding to her previous albums, detailing her personal life over the course of her career and including clues from Anti.[73] In the same month, she canceled her performance at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show to finish work on Anti.[74]The Anti World Tour was announced on 23 November 2015.[75] The Samsung-sponsored tour started in March 2016 and ended in November 2016, with Travis Scott supporting in North America, and Big Sean supporting at selected European dates.[71][76]The album leaked onto the internet in its entirety on 27 January 2016, after it was released prematurely on music streaming service Tidal.[77] Also through Tidal, one million copies of the album were made available for free download via Samsung, regardless of whether a listener is a Tidal subscriber or not.[78][79] The album was released officially worldwide on online stores, like iTunes, two days later.[80]Anti received generally positive reviews from music critics, but critics were more mixed over its sound and Rihanna's artistic direction.[91][92] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, Anti received an average score of 73 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews", based on 31 reviews.[82] The aggregate site AnyDecentMusic? assigned it a score of 6.7 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.[81]Many critics noted Anti as an experimental record compared to Rihanna's previous market-oriented pop albums.[93][94] Those unimpressed took issue with the absence of radio-friendly songs and deemed the album half-hearted and disorienting,[88][95][96] but those complimentary said it represented Rihanna's artistic maturity as an album artist, transcending her previous image as a pop star with serial hit singles.[83][34][35] Alexis Petridis in The Guardian and Jon Caramanica in The New York Times described Anti as a frustrating record without a clear artistic vision.[87][97] Writing for Vice, Robert Christgau lauded the album's catchy production despite its rejection of the formulaic pop song structure.[90] In Spin, Jia Tolentino was somewhat disappointed by the unfocused track list, but welcomed Anti as a sign of artistic evolution: "For once, Rihanna is drawing on whims rather than characters, uncertainties rather than pronouncements, her own desires rather than the desires of her audience."[89]Critics highlighted the diverse musical styles and honest emotional sentiments as a testament to Rihanna's newfound artistic freedom.[34][92] Some, including Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, deemed the experimentation proved Rihanna no longer expected to monetise her music.[83][84][92] In Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos remarked that with Anti, after a decade of releasing chart hits, Rihanna was finally "in charge of her own sound, remaking pop on her own terms".[34] Though some remarked that the album was self-assured and confident,[32][98][99] Amanda Petrusich writing for Pitchfork appreciated Rihanna's newfound introspection and vulnerability, calling it "a fun and conflicted pop record, at its most interesting when it's at its smallest and most idiosyncratic".[31] The Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood similarly commended her inward vision, specifically through the second half's balladry, for "pushing back against her established image" as a flippant pop star.[100] Writing for The Independent, Emily Jupp found the record abundant with Rihanna's self-confidence and underrated singing, disproving "anyone who ever said her voice could only do certain things and showing them she can do anything she wants to."[32]Anti won the award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album at the 2016 American Music Awards.[101] The record received a nomination for Top R&B Album at the 2016 and 2017 Billboard Music Awards[102] and was also nominated for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Recording Package at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.[103] Prior to the Grammy nominations announcement, media outlets predicted that Anti would be nominated for Album of the Year, following the announcement reporters were surprised and felt that the album had been "snubbed".[104][105] Fellow musicians also believed that the album should have been nominated, with Chance the Rapper stating that the album was "underrated".[106] Apart from Anti's nominations, several songs from it were also nominated including "Work" for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, "Needed Me" for Best R&B Performance and "Kiss It Better" for Best R&B Song.[107] At the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards Anti received the award for 'R&B Album of the Year'.[108]According to Metacritic, it was the 12th most prominently ranked album of 2016.[109] NME considered it the 40th best album of the year.[110] On their list of 50 Best Albums of 2016, Rolling Stone placed the album at number 25 and wrote, "Rihanna's long-simmering eighth album brought together stinging songs that showcased the pop provocateur's ever-widening range, both stylistically and vocally."[111] The Independent's Roisin O'Connor ranked the album at number 15 out of 20 music releases of 2016 and wrote, "Anti was the moment Rihanna finally asserted herself as an album artist, after reigning as queen of the singles charts for so many years."[112] The Billboard Staff placed the album at number 11 on their list 50 Best Albums of 2016.[113] Jamieson Cox of Time ranked the record at number seven on their list The Top 10 Best Albums for 2016 and wrote, "Rihanna might be the most charismatic person on the planet, and Anti is her first album to recognize that said charisma is her greatest strength."[114] Christgau ranked its deluxe version as the second best album of the year in his ballot for The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll.[115]Lewis Corner of Digital Spy ranked the album at number seven on his list of 20 best albums of 2016.[116] Same as Corner, Harriet Gibsone of The Guardian also ranked the album at number seven deeming it as one of the "messiest album releases", but also a record that show that Rihanna is one of the greatest music rock stars.[117] In their mid-year report, Entertainment Weekly placed Anti at number four on the list of The 25 best albums of 2016. For the publication, Leah Greenblatt wrote, "Anti's wild, woozy R&B easily earned 24-karat status all on its own."[118] On their final Best Albums of 2016 list, the publication ranked the album at number three and called it "The Emancipation of RiRi", a reference to Mariah Carey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi.[119] Rap-Up additionally placed it at number three on their list of 20 Best Albums of 2016. Fuse ranked Anti at number one on their list The 20 Best Albums of 2016, highlighting the sounds of the album, Rihanna's vocals and the celebration of womanhood.[120] The Fader recognized the release as one of the 24 Albums That Made Albums Matter Again in 2016 and included four songs of the album in their "The Best Songs of 2016" list: "Sex with Me" at number one, "Work" at number 16, "Higher" at number 36 and "Needed Me" at 51.[121][122] According to Metacritic, Anti was the eighth most mentioned album on the Best of the Decade Top 10 Album lists.[123] Some of the publications ranking the album as one of the best of the 2010s decade are:In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified Anti platinum denoting one million copies sold two days after its release, brought by Samsung purchasing one million copies and giving them away as a free download, as part of the November 2015 deal.[134] The album debuted at number 27 on the Billboard 200 chart dated 13 February 2016.[135] Despite its first-week sales of 1.4 million downloads, Billboard did not recognize free album sales via promotions.[136][137] According to data provider Nielsen SoundScan for Billboard, recognized first-week of Anti included 4.7 million streams and 126,000 digital songs.[135] The following week, the album topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the Billboard 200, marking Rihanna's second number one on the latter.[138]Anti peaked atop the Billboard 200 for two non-consecutive weeks, claiming the top spot on the chart week ending 2 April 2016.[139] The same week, its lead single "Work" topped the Billboard Hot 100, marking Rihanna's second time to top both the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 charts, Unapologetic and "Diamonds" topped the charts in December 2012.[140] According to Nielsen SoundScan, Anti was the ninth-best-selling album and the fourth-most-consumed album of 2016 in the United States, amassing 603,000 pure sales, 4.195 million song downloads, and over 1.4 billion streams.[141] By January 2022, the album became the first album by a black female act to spend 300 weeks on the Billboard 200.[142] The RIAA certified Anti triple platinum, marking three million album-equivalent units based on sales and streaming.[143]Anti topped the albums charts in Canada and Norway.[144][145] In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the UK R&B Chart,[146] the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it platinum for surpassing 300,000 units.[147] The album peaked within the top five of albums charts in many European countries, reaching number two in Ireland,[148] Sweden[149] and Switzerland,[150] number three in Denmark,[151] Germany[152] and the Netherlands,[153] number four in Greece[154] and Spain,[155] and number five in the Czech Republic[156] and Finland.[157] It received multi-platinum certifications in France (double platinum)[158] and Denmark (triple platinum).[159] Anti was the most-streamed album by a female artist on Spotify of 2016 worldwide.[160] According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), it sold over one million copies worldwide in 2016.[161] By January 2021, Anti had sold 11 million album-equivalent units worldwide.[162]Doreen St. Félix of MTV News stated that Anti was a "rock-star" album and was noted as a "banner for heterogeneity in R&B — the real range of it," continuing to state that in the early 2010s EDM was the popular genre. St. Félix stated in a more in-depth review that "Anti could even change with the seasons, depending on which tracks you chose to listen to."[163] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated that R&B was in a "golden age" and 2016 "was its most potent year yet". Petridis stated that artists such as Rihanna pushed the genre's "boundaries", noting that Anti was  "sprawling, exploratory and opaque".[164] The album's commercial performance, especially its streaming performance, was noted as helping R&B "flourish" again, along with Drake and Kanye West. Rihanna was cited as the second most streamed artist of 2016 overall, earning 795 million streams by June and was named the most streamed female of 2016 and 2017 by Spotify.[165][166] Anti produced eight songs that topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart — "Work", "Kiss It Better", "Needed Me", "Love on the Brain", "Sex with Me", "Pose", "Desperado" and "Consideration" — surpassing Katy Perry's Teenage Dream (2010) as the album with the most number-one songs on that chart.[167][168]Rolling Stone's journalist Brittany Spanos stated that Rihanna was one of three black women, alongside Beyoncé and Solange, who "radicalized Pop in 2016". In an in-depth review, Spanos stated "the album is a startlingly direct statement from a black female pop star, one that many are not afforded the opportunity to express. In the media, black women are often cast as either jezebels or mammies – oversexed or undersexed with no choice as to how they are received. Rihanna's resistance to typecasting and her positive affirmation of her sexual agency made her the year's slyest rebel, a maverick living life as she pleases."[169] Taj Rani of Billboard stated "Work" has brought the genre of dancehall to the forefront of American music, as it became the first dancehall song to top the Billboard Hot 100 since Sean Paul's "Temperature" reached the feat in 2006. She opined the song is a prime example of "an unapologetic black woman proudly showing her heritage at a time when our politics are dominated by #BlackLivesMatter and Donald Trump's racist, xenophobic and misogynistic tirades."[170] Da'Shan Smith of Billboard stated "Love on the Brain" became the most subtly influential pop single of 2017, as the music industry experienced "a prominent surge of retro-harkening balladry, across different musical genres", following the success of this song on pop radio, which he described as "a rare find today, because traditional R&B's presence on the format is an oddity."[171]Marilyn Manson cited Anti as an influence on his band's album Heaven Upside Down, saying: "Strangely enough, one of the records that influenced this album strongly, and it can't be taken literally, is Rihanna, her last record. That one song, 'Love on the Brain', it really hit me because I saw her perform it and she just... meant it."[172] Album track "Higher" inspired the song "Liability" from New Zealand singer Lorde's second album Melodrama (2017), when Lorde was reportedly "moved to tears" listening to "Higher" and this helped her to write "Liability".[173] Contemporary artist Awol Erizku created a series of pieces inspired by musicians, one of the pieces was titled, "Same Ol' Mistakes," inspired by the song of the same name from the album Anti. Referencing one of Rihanna's logos, Erizku spoke of how the song inspired his artwork, stating: "I always thought that logo was really funny. It's one aspect of pop culture that I thought fit in my world, Rihanna is a voice of our generation, one of our ideals of beauty. You can see these two things co-existing in the same environment."[174] In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked Anti at number 230 on their The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.[175]Credits adapted from Rihanna's official website.[17]NotesSample creditsCredits are adapted from Rihanna's website.[177]Performers and musiciansProductionDesign and management* Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.

CAG promoter;"The CAG promoter is a strong synthetic promoter frequently used to drive high levels of gene expression in mammalian expression vectors.[1][2]CAG promoter was constructed in the lab of Dr Jun-ichi Miyazaki [3][4] from the following sequences: The resulting synthetic element was used in the pCAGGS expression vector. The initiation codon located at the proximal region of the second exon was disrupted by digesting with NcoI restriction enzyme and replacing the site with a HindIII linker.[3]Although the whole construct is commonly referred to as the "CAG promoter", it is not a promoter in a strict sense, as it includes a part of the transcribed sequence (the first exon and the first intron of chicken beta-actin gene) and enhancer elements. In addition to the CMV immediate early enhancer, the intron of the chicken beta actin gene contains an enhancer element, which is highly conserved among vertebrates. The 3' part of the promoter has high GC content and is thus refractory to PCR amplification.This molecular or cell biology article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

On 6 January 2009 the incorporation of Borgerligt Centrum was announced.On 16 June 2009, he announced that he had joined Liberal Alliance and dissolved Borgerligt Centrum.[2] The dissolution was strongly contested by those members of the board who did not follow him in leaving the party.[3] The remaining board members of the Borgerligt Centrum initiated legal proceedings against Ammitzbøll. He is notable for being the only Danish member of parliament to have been member of three different parties in less than a year.[citation needed] On 30 August 2011, and with 5.0% voter support, Ammitzbøll, told on air to Danish Radio, that a vote for the Liberal Alliance is a vote for free hashish.[4]On 22 October 2019, Ammitzbøll-Bille left Liberal Alliance, citing political differences.[5] On 7 November he founded the party Forward together with Christina Egelund, also former MP from Liberal Alliance.[6] On October 8, 2020 Ammitzbøll-Bille announced Forward was disbanded, and he would continue as an independent member of parliament.[7]Ammitzbøll-Bille is openly bisexual, and was married to another man, Henning Olsen[8] until Olsen died in August 2016, after a long battle with cancer.[9] In June 2017 he began a relationship with Kristine Bille,[10] whom he married in November 2017.[11] In October 2017, they announced that they are expecting their first child in the Spring of 2018.[12]He was named the year's politician in 2006 by LGBT Danmark. LGBT rights have also been among Ammitzbøll's political affairs. In November 2008, he proposed a parliamentary resolution that would allow couples in a registered partnership to adopt children from other countries. Thanks to the support of the members of Liberal Alliance in the vote on 17 March 2009, the proposal was adopted, and same-sex couples were able to adopt jointly in Denmark from 2010.Ammitzbøll-Bille traveled to Latvia in July 2006 to attend the second Baltic Pride. However, the parade had to be canceled shortly before, when the police of Riga were unable to guarantee the safety of the participants. The organizers decided to hold a conference on LGBT rights in Riga to replace the parade. However, they were attacked by angry demonstrators who surrounded a church in which Ammitzbøll-Bille and the other participants were part of that day's program. For several hours, the protesters shouted slogans and threw eggs , tomatoes and stools against the participants. After the event, Ammitzbøll-Bille stated about his experiences in the media, and in conjunction with other EU politicians, called for more rights for minorities in the former Soviet countries.[13]On 3 June 2007 Ammitzbøll-Bille traveled again to Latvia, and this time it was possible to complete the parade with the protection of the Latvian authorities."
Gardening in Scotland;"Gardening in Scotland, the design of planned spaces set aside for the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature in Scotland began in the Middle Ages.Gardens, or yards, around medieval abbeys, castles and houses were formal and in the European tradition of herb garden, kitchen garden and orchard. The first Renaissance style gardens in Scotland were built for the Stewart dynasty at their royal palaces. Members of the nobility and gentry followed suit. From the late sixteenth century, the landscaping of many estate houses was influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. From this period there are many examples of formal gardens created for nobles, gentry and lairds. The legacy of the Auld Alliance and the beginnings of the grand tour meant that French styles were particularly important in Scotland, although adapted for the Scottish climate. In the late seventeenth century William Bruce put Scotland at the forefront of European garden design.In the eighteenth century there was a reaction against the "absolutism" and "popery" of the French court and a retreat from the expense of maintaining large formal gardens. The move to a less formal landscape of parklands and irregular clumps of planting, associated in England with Capability Brown, was dominated in Scotland by his followers, Robert Robinson and Thomas White senior and junior. New ideas about gardening developed in the nineteenth century including the writings of Humphry Repton. The mid-nineteenth century saw the beginnings of formal public parks.In the early twentieth century Scottish plant collectors continued to be highly active. Gardening began to be a major pursuit of the working and middle classes in the twentieth century. Some major planned gardens were created in the twentieth century including Ian Hamilton Finlay's Little Sparta and Charles Jencks' post-modern Garden of Cosmic Speculation.Gardens, as designated spaces for planting, first came to Scotland with Christianity and monasticism from the sixth century. The monastery of Iona had such a garden for medicinal herbs and other plants and tended by an Irish gardener from the time of Columba (521–597).[1] By the late Middle Ages gardens, or yards, around medieval abbeys, castles and houses were formal and in the European tradition of herb garden, kitchen garden and orchard.[2] Such gardens are known to have been present at Pluscarden Priory, Beauly Priory and Kinloss Abbey and created for the Bishop of Moray at Spynie in the mid-sixteenth century.[3] The gardens of castles and estate houses were often surrounded by defensive walls and they sometimes adjoined a hunting park.[2] Urban houses had gardens as part of burgage plots that stretched behind houses, often used to produce vegetables such as kale and beans.[4]The first Renaissance-style gardens in Scotland were built for the Stewart dynasty at their royal palaces. French gardeners were hired by James IV at Stirling Castle in 1501, where the King's Knot Garden was developed[2] and at Holyrood Palace around 1504, where the gardens were probably remodelled from monastic gardens. A "Queen's Garden" was created there in 1511. The gardens at both Stirling and Holyrood were overseen by a priest, Sir John Sharp.[3] James V remodelled the gardens at Holyrood again in 1536,[2] employing the Frenchman Bertrand Gallotre at both Holyrood and Stirling. At Holyrood the ditches surrounding the gardens were improved and the ponds drained.[3] Archaeological remains indicate there were sophisticated formal gardens.[2] John Morrison became the chief gardener of the south side of the palace in 1546 and remained there until 1598.[3] During the personal reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1561–67), there was an emphasis on herbs and vegetables. The ponds may have been permanently drained in this period and the monastic areas were planted with trees to make orchards and pleasant walking areas.[3] Similar landscaping is also found at Falkland Palace and Linlithgow Palace.[2]Members of the nobility and gentry followed suit, with gardens recorded for Hugh Rose of Kilravock, built in 1536, and for the Seatons of Touch at Greenknowe Tower, which had gardens and avenues surrounding it. The gardens at Kinloss were improved by William Luban of Dieppe after his arrival in Scotland in 1540 and four years later he created the garden around the new palace at Beauly.[3]Although relatively few early modern gardens have survived unchanged, they can be seen in the maps of Timothy Pont (c. 1565–1614) from the 1590s, which depict abbeys, castles and estate houses surrounded by greenery, earthworks, orchards and arboretums.[3] From the late sixteenth century, the landscaping of many estate houses was influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens.[2] These were seen as retreats from the troubles of the world and were eulogised in country house poetry like that of William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649).[5]From this period there are many examples of formal gardens created for nobles, gentry and lairds. By the end of the seventeenth century there were at least 141 formal gardens and orchards in Scotland.[6] The gardens of Aberdour Castle were redeveloped along with the building for the regent James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton (c. 1516–81), perhaps as an area for public display.[7] Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries, designed for the entertainment of guests. Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584–1650), planted a herb garden at Seton Palace in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century is that at Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?–1610) created an enclosure of Renaissance-style walls, adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him.[5] The change to walled gardens may have been because of a change of attitudes to smells, with the walls helping to intensify the scent of the herbs and flowers that grew there.[8]Mary Sutton, Countess of  Home had a terraced garden in Edinburgh's Canongate, at Moray House from the 1620s (now destroyed). She had inventories made of the trees and walks. The planting probably reflected other gardens in Edinburgh, but also would have responded to her experience of English gardens and the style of her cousin Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, particularly at Bedford House.[9] The legacy of the Auld Alliance[10] and the beginnings of the grand tour[2] meant that French styles were particularly important in Scotland, although adapted for the Scottish climate. From the late seventeenth century the gardens at Versailles, with their formal avenues, parterres, and fountains that stressed symmetry and order, were a model. After the Glorious Revolution Dutch influences were also significant, with uniform planting and topiary.[10]  Gardening books from the continent and England became widely available in this period and the first gardening book was published in Scotland.[2] This was John Reid's, Scots Gard'ner (1683). Reid had been gardener at Niddry Castle, Hamilton Castle, and Drummond Castle and for George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh.[11][12] The book borrowed from John Evelyn's (1658) translation of Nicholas de Bonnefon's Le jardinier françois (1651), adapting its ideas for Scottish conditions.[2]In the late seventeenth century William Bruce (c. 1630–1710) put Scotland at the forefront of European garden design. He lowered garden walls to incorporate the surrounding countryside into the vista. This allowed a focus on significant landscape features such as Bass rock at Balcaskie and Loch Leven Castle at Kinross. Alexander Edward (1651–1708) continued in the tradition established by Bruce, adding landscapes at houses including Hamilton Palace and Kinnaird castle, Angus.[2] Grand schemes in the French tradition included James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry's (1662–1711) reworking of the terraces at Drumlanrig Castle, which incorporated the Douglas family crest into the parterres design. There is also the militaristic earthworks undertaken for Field Marshal John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair (1679–1747) at Castle Kennedy, Wigtownshire.[2] The Earl of Mar's palace at Alloa was the grandest realisation of the Versailles style gardens in Scotland: it included canals, parterres, statues and ornamental trees.[10] Common features in gardens of this period were elaborate sundials, such as the one created by John Mylne (c. 1589–1657) at Holyrood (1633) and that at Newbattle Abbey.[13] The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh was founded in 1670, as a physic garden by combining the collections of doctor Robert Sibbald and botanist Andrew Balfour as a source of medicines.[2] A physic garden was founded at the University of Glasgow in 1703.[14]In the eighteenth century there was a reaction against the "absolutism" and "popery" of the French court and a retreat from the expense of maintaining large formal gardens. Less symmetrical layouts became common with the development of the "natural" style of the jardin anglais, which attempted to create vistas of a rural idyll.[10] The antiquarian John Clerk of Pennycuik (1676–1755), one of the key figures in defining elite taste in Scotland, eulogising the estate garden in his poem The Country Seat (1727), which built on the ideas of Alexander Pope. He created gardens at Mavisbank and Penicuik, Midlothian, with the help of architect William Adam (1689–1748), which combined formality with undulating ground.[10] Adam laid down that "the rising and falling of the ground are to be humoured and make the greatest Beauteys in gardens".[2] Adam's work included the landscaped park and avenue at Yester House and Hopetoun House, where the landscaped garden was reminiscent of a Roman campagnia.[15]The move to a less formal landscape of parklands and irregular clumps of planting, associated in England with Capability Brown (1716–1783), was dominated in Scotland by his followers, Robert Robinson and Thomas White senior and junior. From 1770 and 1809 the Whites were involved in the planning of over 70 estate gardens in Scotland, including those at Glamis Castle and Scone Palace. Important publications included James Justice's The Scottish Gardiner's Director (1754) and the reputation of Scottish gardeners in managing greenhouses, hot walls and the cultivation of fruit trees meant that they began to be in demand in England. At the end of eighteenth century there began to be a reaction to the English style of garden, influenced by picturesque taste and the spread of Ossianic Romanticism, which encouraged gardens in the wild. This resulted in creation of features like Ossian's Hall of Mirrors at the Hermitage Dunkeld and the Hermit's Cave at the Falls of Acharn, which put an emphasis on concealment and the surprise revelation of the natural.[2]Lower down the social scale, gardening for many crofters and agricultural labourers was focused around a small area near their house, in Shetland, and to a lesser extent in Orkney, it was often a small drystone enclosure known as a planticrue, which was particularly used for the growing of cabbages, and in the lowlands it was a kailyard,[16][17] which produced greens and later potatoes, that were an important part of the family diet.[18] Originally "exotic" plants, like turnips, onions, potatoes and rhubarb were exclusive to physic gardens, prized for their medicinal and nutritional value, and then were adopted by the upper classes, but gradually spread out to the gardens of ordinary people. This process was encouraged by figures such as John Hope (1725–1786), who was king's botanist in Edinburgh from 1761 and later Regius Professor of botany and medicine.[19]New ideas about gardening developed in the nineteenth century. The writings of Humphrey Repton (1752–1818) were highly influential in the return of the formal garden near to the major house. His sons were directly involved in the restructuring of the landscape at Valleyfield, Fife.[2] Walter Scott's dislike of the sweeping away of the old formal gardens was also influential in creating an emphasis on preservation and restoration. His ideas were taken up by John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843), the most prolific gardening author of the century in Britain, and were highly influential throughout the world. By 1850 ambitious formal gardens had been recreated at Drummond Castle, Dunrobin and Drumlandrig.[2]New plants from around the world, often discovered and sampled by Scots such as David Douglas (1799–1834) and John Jeffrey (1826–54), and including the rhododendron and monkey puzzle tree, meant that Victorian and Edwardian gardens were characterised by an eclectic mix of the formal, picturesque, and gardenesque. By the end of the century the ideas of William Robinson (1838–1935), Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932) and the Edinburgh-based Frances Hope (d. 1880), arguing for informal flower-based gardens, had begun to dominate. They resulted in a revival of the seventeenth-century mixed flower and kitchen garden, as carried out at Kellie Castle, and Earlshall Castle, Fife by Robert Lorimer.[2]The mid-nineteenth century saw the beginnings of formal public parks. Designers included Joseph Paxton (1803–1865), who developed Kelvingrove Park and Queen's Park in Glasgow and the Public Park, Dumfirmline. James Whitton became director of public parks in Glasgow and played a leading role in the development of parks towards the end of the century.[2] The mild climate and soils of western Scotland facilitated the creation of special plantsman's gardens at Crarae, Arduaine and Younger Botanic Garden in Argyllshire and at Inverewe, Sutherland and Logan Botanic Garden, Wigtownshire.[2]Scottish plant collectors continued to be highly active in the early twentieth century. George Forest (1873–1932) undertook seven expeditions to Western China between 1904 and 1932, bringing back over 30,000 botanical specimens. Other major figures in the field included Euan Cox (1893–1977) and George Sheriff (1898–1967).[2]Some major planned gardens were created in the twentieth century. Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925–2006) garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960, combining landscape, sculpture and concrete poetry.[20] The American-born Charles Jencks (b. 1939) has developed a number of landscape and sculpture gardens in Scotland, including the post-modern Garden of Cosmic Speculation near Dumfrieshire, begun in 1988, which incorporates elements of the history of the cosmos into traditional designs.[21]Both The National Trust for Scotland and Scotland's Gardens were founded in 1931. The National Trust owns and maintains many major gardens, particularly those associated with palaces, castles and estate houses. The Scotland's Gardens scheme opens gardens not normally seen by the public, using the proceeds to fund charities.[22]Gardening began to be a major pursuit of the working and middle classes in the twentieth century. In the inter-war period there was a concerted attempt to encourage working-class men to abandon their traditional leisure activities in favour of activity in the garden, which was often given over to vegetable growing. Gardens were a deliberate part of the council housing schemes of the period, although the high density housing used in Scotland meant that there was less provision on the garden-suburb model than in England. Allotments were seen as one solution and by 1939 there were over 20,000 in Scotland. It was among the middle classes that domestic gardening took off in this period, fuelled by horticultural shows, open gardens, items in newspapers and increasing use of landscape features.[23]In the post-war period there were increasing numbers of people who possessed gardens. This resulted in increased information on gardening on radio and TV. In 1978 the BBC began to broadcast The Beechgrove Garden, filmed in Scotland and aimed at the owners of suburban semi-detached houses. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries saw a huge increase in do-it-yourself gardening books and magazines.[24]"
Mantegna funerary chapel;"The Mantegna funerary chapel (Italian - cappella funeraria di Andrea Mantegna) is one of the chapels of the Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua. It houses the tomb of the painter Mantegna and his last two paintings - Baptism of Christ (1506, on the high altar and probably completed by his son Francesco) and Holy Family with St John the Baptist, St Elizabeth and St Zacharias (1504-1506). Its frescoes from 1507 were painted by his sons Ludovico and Francesco and by a young Correggio. The tomb bears a bronze figure of Mantegna by Gianmarco Cavalli. Court painter to the Gonzagas for over 40 years, Mantegna's prestige meant he was granted a funerary chapel in the basilica which served their Marquisate of Mantua - this was the first side-chapel on the left beside Leon Battista Alberti's nave. Correggio was probably in Mantua at the time of Mantegna's death and probably came up with the overall scheme as well as doing much of the actual painting. In general the chapel was inspired by the plan for the chapel of pope Innocent VIII in the Belvedere in the Vatican, painted between 1488 and 1490 and destroyed in the 18th century. Historic descriptions record (among other things) its Stories of St John the Baptist and its trompe l'oeil marble fittings, vaulting, festoons, domes, putti and cherubs.Mantegna, Holy Family with Saints John the Baptist, Elizabeth and ZachariasBase of the domeDetail of the frescoCorreggio, grisaille showing Beheading of St John the BaptistCorreggio, St John the Evangelist with the eagle"
José Baselga;"Josep Baselga i Torres, known in Spanish as José Baselga (3 July 1959 –  21 March 2021) was a Spanish medical oncologist and researcher focused on the development of novel molecular targeted agents, with a special emphasis in breast cancer. Through his career he was associated with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, and the Massachusetts General Hospital in their hematology and oncology divisions. He led the development of the breast cancer treatment Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody, that targets the HER2 protein which is impacted in aggressive breast cancers.He served as Physician-in-Chief at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and was also the president of the American Association for Cancer Research.[1][2][3][4]Baselga was born on 3 July 1959, in Barcelona in Spain.[5] He received his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the Autonomous University of Barcelona in 1982.[6] He completed a fellowship in Medical Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and subsequently stayed on as a faculty member of its Breast Medicine Service.[6]Baselga started his career with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center where he worked with John Mendelsohn in studying the role of monoclonal antibodies in the targeting proteins associated with breast and lung cancers.[5] He then returned to Spain, where he established the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, within the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital. He served as the chairman of the center from 1996 and 2010. During his time there, the institute emerged as a leading center of cancer research, therapies, and early stage clinical trials.[5] Returning to the United States, he served at the Massachusetts General Hospital as the chief of its hematology and oncology divisions between 2010 and 2013.[5] He then returned to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to become its chief medical officer in 2013.[5]He was appointed physician-in-chief at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 2012[7] and a professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in 2013.[8] He held other leadership positions including serving as the president at the American Association for Cancer Research and was the editor of the Cancer Discovery medical journal.[5]Through his career he was noted for development of targeted cancer treatment capabilities. Specifically, he led the development of the breast cancer treatment Herceptin. The treatment is based on a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 protein which is impacted in aggressive breast cancers. He led the early-stage clinical trial of the drug and led to findings that this targeted treatment along with chemotherapy could extend the lives of patients with HER2 positive breast cancers.[5] He was involved in the clinical development of targeted drugs for cancer including cetuximab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab and lapatinib.[9][10] His research focus extended to the study of drug resistance in some cancers. He also studied drugs that could target tumors stemming from the PI3K mutation.[5]He resigned from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in September 2018, after an exposé by The New York Times and the non-profit investigative journalism organization ProPublica, which called out that he had failed to report payments to the tune of millions of dollars from healthcare and drug companies in publications including The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet.[11][12] The incident led to the center announcing a rehaul of their conflict of interest policies. The New York Times also reported that the non-profit hospital paid more than $1.5 million in severance to Baselga in 2018 and 2019.[13] Baselga also resigned from the boards of the drug company Bristol Myers Squibb and the radiation equipment firm Varian Medical Systems.[14] He also resigned from his position as co-editor in chief of the journal Cancer Discovery.[14]Baselga was one of the principal investigators of the Stand Up to Cancer "Dream Team" for "Targeting the PI3K Pathway in Women’s Cancers".[15]In January 2019, AstraZeneca announced that they had hired Baselga as head of research and development in oncology, where he worked until his death.[14] During this time, he led the company's partnership with Japanese pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo, to develop two cancer treatments in addition to building the company's cancer research capabilities.[5]Baselga was married to Silvia Garriga. The couple had four children and remained married for 30 years before Baselga's death.[5] He died on 21 March 2021 due to complications related to Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in his home of Cerdanya, province of Girona.[16][17][18] He was aged 61.[5]"
Röddinge Formation;"The Röddinge Formation is a geologic formation in Skåne County, southern Sweden. It is Early Jurassic (Sinemurian-Toarcian) in age.[1] It is a unit with a limited degree of exposure, being identified mostly by its deposits on the Fyledalen Fault Zone, specially on Kurremölla, where is present the main fossil deposit.[2] It is a unit known mostly for large museum collections and estimated to have a thickness of several hundreds of meters.[3] It is also known for its large iron deposits.[2] It is correlated with the mostly marine Rya Formation of western Skåne County, the Volcanic deposits of the Djupadal Formation and specially the Sorthat Formation of Bornholm.[4][5] Most likely, the coarse-grained nature of the Röddinge Formation is linked to rapid erosion of a tectonically active hinterland.[6]A profile up to 300 m thick was described in 1968 from the Eriksdal-Kurremölla area, dated Pliensbachian-Toarcian.[7] The Pliensbachian levels where dominated by sands and sandstones of marine origin, hosting a highly fossiliferous bed containing a rich mollusc fauna.[7] A Sinemurian layer assigned to the formation was also found on other works.[3]The Röddinge formation has a great abundance of Limonite and Chamosite quartz arenites, fine-to medium-grained, with subordinate thin conglomerates.[1] Sediments related to the unit are found consolidated by Berthierine or Siderite cement, with berthierine oolites being common on the layers.[1] These ooids are rather small on most of the successions, around 0.3 mm in diameter and ellipsoidal in shape, having cores composed by detrital quartz or heavy minerals.[1] The deposits of the formation evidence strong degradation by modern weathering and have a red, brown or yellow stain (iron hydroxides).[1] The deposits not affected by erosion are known from boreholes and host greyish dark green facies due to the content of berthierine and siderite.[1] The iron contents differ based on the weathering grade of the layers: on weathered sandstones is about 8–10%, then is in up to 20% in the oolites, and finally at the major fossiliferous deposit on Kurremölla a 1.7 m thick oolite bed has an iron content of up to 35%.[1] Owing to this high content in iron, the Kurremölla locality was mined from 1930 to 1937, although there was not enough iron supply and enrichments were too dispersed in the source rock, which led to it not being economically viable to maintain the mining process for very long.[8][9] The presence of mostly poor exposures has made mostly impossible to do detailed facies analysis, although is suggested that the sediments come from prolonged reworking.[1]The Röddinge formation is considered mostly a coeval developing unit with the Jurassic formations of Bornholm, as both where connected as part of the Fennoscandian mainland.[5] The unit is considered to be part of the fluvial to deltaic system found also or Bornholm.[5] However, as happened on the Hasle Formation, the Röddinge formation hosted a major marine ingression at least on the Lower-Middle Pliensbachian (jamesoni subzone), with both sharing the Ammonite fauna and the ecosystems.[10] The main fossiliferous content of the formation comes from marine influence, clearly indicated by finds of ammonites and crinoids.[8] After this event, in the Toarcian the formation developed along the Sorthat Formation, forming both part of the large deltaic system that ended on northern Germany.[11] There is also suggestions that towards the west a lake system was developed, covering the marine basin after the local Late Pliensbachian-Lower Toarcian regression.[2] This lake system is evidenced on several boreholes, and was probably developed on the western lateral of the major fluvial system recorded locally and on Bornholm.[2] Like the Sorthat Formation, this upper unit also hosts possible coal beds.[2] Both, the lake and the fluvial system layers host iron ooids that indicate diagenetic precipitation, prior to and during sediment compaction.[1]  This is also found on the Rydebäck and Katslösa Members of the Rya Formation, and has been suggested that the volcanic activity developed on the coeval Djupadal Formation may have stimulated the process.[1]SerpulaJamesoni Zone, Lower PliensbachianHigh energy marginal marine derived from sea ingressionTrace fossils, polychaete encrusters in rockA sessile, marine annelid tube worm of the family Serpulidae.

Dawson College shooting;"The Dawson College shooting occurred on September 13, 2006, at Dawson College, a CEGEP located in  downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The perpetrator, Kimveer Singh Gill, began shooting outside the de Maisonneuve Boulevard entrance to the school, and moved towards the atrium by the cafeteria on the main floor.[1][2] One victim died at the scene, while another 19 were injured, eight of whom were listed in critical condition, with six requiring surgery.[3][4][5] The shooter later committed suicide, after being shot in the arm by a police officer.[6] It was the third fatal school shooting in Montreal, after the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989 and the shooting spree at Concordia University in 1992.At 12:30 p.m. EDT, Gill parked his car on de Maisonneuve Boulevard near the college campus and was seen removing weapons from his trunk by bystanders. Gill briefly took a passerby hostage and forced him to carry a bag containing a fourth gun and additional ammunition. Gill opened fire at students outside on the steps of Dawson College at its rear entrance with a semi-automatic carbine, and the passerby fled the melee, leaving Gill's bag.[7]Gill then entered the school and made his way to the cafeteria, almost directly ahead of the school entrance. He positioned himself in the corner of the building, near the microwave oven, and set his bag on the floor. He loaded a pistol, fired a shot into the floor and then shot students who were standing in front of him. He then raised his weapon and ordered the remaining students to lie down on the floor. He continued shooting at students until confronted by two police officers who had been visiting the school at the time regarding an unrelated incident. The police officers entered after hearing the gunfire, and rushed to the cafeteria. Additional police officers surrounded the campus. Confronted by police officers in the school cafeteria, Gill briefly took two more people hostage.[8]He was shot in the arm by police officer Denis Côté and then committed suicide via a gunshot wound to the head at 12:48 EDT.[6] The police officers attempted to resuscitate him, but failed. At 1:30 p.m., police officers dragged his body outside the building, covered it with a yellow bag, then continued the evacuation and the search for possible accomplices.[9][10]  Authorities concluded the attack was premeditated, after a short suicide note was found on Gill's body during the autopsy.[11]The television network TVA reported that security camera footage from Place Alexis Nihon showed Gill staking out the area as far back as August 10, more than a month before the shootings.[7][12]The police confirmed the death of one victim, an 18-year-old woman who was shot in the abdomen and died on the scene.[3] Canadian newspapers later identified the woman as Anastasia Rebecca De Sousa.[13]The Montreal Police Service later reported that 19 other people had been wounded.[4] One victim, who was reportedly at Dawson College to visit friends, suffered two shots to the head.  He underwent intensive surgery, the doctors removed one bullet, and he remained in a coma for one week after the shooting as doctors determined whether they should try to remove the second bullet.[14] After two weeks on a ventilator, he emerged from the coma and as of 3 November 2006[update] was recovering.[15]Police initially looked for as many as three suspects, but Montreal Police Chief Yvan Delorme later confirmed that there was only one shooter, who shot himself fatally on the scene.[4] Many eyewitnesses described a man with a Mohawk hairstyle, wearing a black trenchcoat,[16] black trousers with metal studs, and combat boots. The suspect carried three weapons, including a semi-automatic carbine.[17]That evening, a Sûreté du Québec spokesperson confirmed to LCN TV reporters that the shooter was a 25-year-old male, born in Québec.[18] Police found his car, a black Pontiac Sunfire, parked close to the school, and later searched the house where he lived with his mother, seizing a computer and other belongings.[19]Around midnight on Wednesday, police confirmed to the media that the suspect was Kimveer Gill, a 25-year-old Laval resident, a graduate from Rosemere High School.[20] An autopsy later revealed that Gill committed suicide after being hit in the arm by police officer Denis Côté's gunfire.[21] It was revealed that Gill's actions were premeditated, a short suicide note was found on Gill's body.[11]During a police search at Gill's home, an apology note to his family was found. In addition, police seized firearm accessories including holsters and manuals, including those of the firearm he used during attack, they also found a letter praising the actions of Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.[22]Police cordoned off the campus area and swept the school for students left inside.[23] Local radio reports placed the number of police vehicles at approximately 80 and up to 24 ambulances surrounded the building. Students and faculty were evacuated from the campus or left the vicinity of the shooting.Two shopping centres adjacent to Dawson, Place Alexis Nihon and Westmount Square, directly linked to the Atwater metro station, were evacuated and the green line of the Montreal Metro was shut down for several hours between Lionel-Groulx and McGill.[24] The Pepsi Forum entertainment centre, opposite the eastern corner of Dawson, was open when many of the students came running into the premises moments after the shooting began. Shortly afterward, the Pepsi Forum went into lockdown under the directives of the Montreal Police. Eventually, one of the Forum's entrances onto St. Catherine Street re-opened under police/security guard to allow monitored access and egress.A large number of the evacuees were also directed to the nearby Concordia University, where the Concordia Student Union (CSU) is located. The CSU cancelled all remaining Orientation activities, and instead used its venues to temporarily shelter the evacuated Dawson students and provide them with food, water, blankets, and phones to reach other loved ones. A coordination team was put in place from the CSU, and the DSU used the Sir George Williams campus as a temporary crisis centre and offered counselling (psychologist, psychiatrist) to traumatized students and staff. Claude Dauphin (Mayor of the borough of Lachine and Vice-President of the City of Montreal executive committee) had a very close relationship with both of the student unions during the night of the events, Dauphin went to the CSU office's the night of the shooting to meet with both unions to inform them of what the city was doing, and to ask how he could help.The police also established several phone numbers for parents and friends of the students.[25]Police reported that they needed a few days to process the crime scene. As a result, officials from Dawson College stated that the school would be closed until Monday, September 18, 2006,[26] scheduled to open its doors at 11:00 a.m. and remain open until 7:00 p.m. and have an "Open House" feel to the day. Classes were scheduled to resume as usual on Tuesday, September 19, 2006.A follow-up study conducted by the McGill University Health Centre Research Institute found that 30% of Dawson students at the time of the shooting suffered mental health consequences including post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, alcohol dependence, and social phobia, a level twice that found in the general population. Approximately 18% of respondents developed a mental health disorder despite never having had one before.[27][28]Kimveer Gill was a 25-year-old Canadian born in Lachine, Quebec, Canada. His parents were of Punjabi descent, and moved to Saint-Laurent, Quebec from India in early 1981.[29]  The family later settled in the Fabreville area of Laval, Quebec in 1987. Kimveer attended Twin Oaks Elementary School in Laval from 1988 to 1993.Gill later attended Rosemere High School, where he was remembered by teachers as quiet and unassuming. Despite early media reports, he performed well academically, and most students remember him as having friends and certainly never being bullied.[30] Kimveer graduated from Rosemere High School in June 1998. He enrolled in Vanier College with his friends Steven Kulczycki, Andrew Page, and Jason Rust. However, he dropped out in January 1999.Gill briefly received military training from the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, from January 17 to February 16, 1999. He had told his friends he wished to eventually become a mercenary. He did not complete his basic training for unknown reasons.[12]  He was deemed unsuitable for military service and was voluntarily discharged before receiving extensive weapons training. Gill was a member of a rifle club and visited the Ville Saint-Pierre facility the day prior to the shooting.[31][32]The killer's profile was discovered on a website called VampireFreaks under the screen name "fatality666."  The last login was at 10:35 a.m. on the day of the shooting.[33] The profile was subsequently restricted to registered users, and then removed entirely.[citation needed]Gill was armed with a Beretta Cx4 Storm pistol-caliber carbine,[34] a Glock pistol (reports are conflicting as to whether this was chambered in 9mm or .45 ACP), and a shotgun. He fired sixty shots, ten of which were fired outside the school. With the exception of five shots from his pistol, including the one to kill himself, all the shots came from the rifle.[35]There were reports of an additional firearm in a bag that he forced a hostage to bring along as he arrived near the campus site. According to TVA's crime reporter Claude Poirier, Gill briefly held a lawyer hostage and demanded that he bring the bag containing the fourth gun and additional ammunition. When the first shots were fired and police arrived, the lawyer fled the scene and hid Gill's bag.[7]Gill had a restricted firearm license. His firearms were registered with the Canadian gun registry. The transportation, storage, and use of his firearms in the incident were not legal as per firearms regulation in Canada, despite the acquisition and possession being legal.Some student leaders criticized the immediate response of the Dawson College administration. The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that "if it hadn't been for help from the Student Union at nearby Concordia University... many of the Dawson students would have had no one to turn to for help."[36]Dawson's director-general Richard Filion called the student charges harsh."We did our best to evacuate the building. We were in a state of shock. We were scattered everywhere around the city," Filion said, noting many staff members were out on lunch break.Dawson does have an emergency plan, he said, but it was designed with fire safety in mind.[37]Filion announced that staff and faculty would return to the College on Friday, September 15, and that classes would resume on Tuesday, September 19, 2006. The school invited all students to join them on Monday, September 18, 2006 to meet with staff and faculty for information and support, as well as to retrieve belongings that had been left behind. It was announced that grief counseling and support services would be available on an ongoing basis.In addition, one of the victims, 18-year-old Hayder Kadhim, who received two bullet wounds to the head and neck, challenged Prime Minister Stephen Harper to a gun control debate in a public speech on CBC in response to the shooting.[38]Monique Lépine (mother of Marc Lépine, the perpetrator of the École Polytechnique massacre) spoke out in wake of the shooting, the first time she had ever done so since her son's massacre 16 years prior.[44]An immediate controversy arose about an article regarding the Dawson shootings by journalist Jan Wong, of the Toronto-based The Globe and Mail. Three days after the event, Wong, who was born and raised in Montreal and is the daughter of Chinese immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled Get under the desk, in which she drew a link between all three school shootings in Quebec history (the École Polytechnique, the Concordia University and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of Quebec society under its protective language laws.[45]Wong suggested the fact that the three perpetrators were not old-stock French Quebecers (the shooters were Algerian, Belarusian, and Punjabi in descent) was related to their murderous actions since, she claimed, they were alienated from a Quebec society concerned with "racial purity." Accused of "Quebec bashing," Wong's writing soon created public outcry in Quebec and political condemnation. Quebec Premier Jean Charest called the article a "disgrace", stating that it "betrays an ignorance of Canadian values and a profound misunderstanding of Québec."[46] On September 20, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper pronounced it "prejudiced, absurd, irresponsible and without foundation",[47] the same day, the House of Commons of Canada unanimously passed a motion requesting an apology for the column.[48]Wong's writing followed the comments of Professor Elliott Leyton, a social-anthropologist who is a widely consulted expert on serial homicide.[49]Interviewed by CBC Newsworld on September 14, 2006 about the Dawson College shooting, Leyton stated that because all three such murderous rampages in Quebec involved a killer who was either an immigrant or a child of immigrants, it warranted an examination of government and societal attitudes.In 2007, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council faulted CKNW, a radio station in Vancouver, British Columbia for airing "potentially dangerous information" during the Dawson College shooting. During the incident, CKNW had simulcast content from its sister stations in Montreal which included students speaking by cellphone from inside the school. A Vancouver man complained that the content could have told the gunman where the students were. The council said that as a result of modern technology reducing geographic distance as a barrier, CKNW had breached Section 10 (coverage of violent situations) of the broadcast code. The station broadcast the decision as required, but did not air an apology.[50]Gill mentioned the song "A Tout le Monde" by the thrash metal band Megadeth on his blog on VampireFreaks.com on the day of the shooting. Megadeth was blamed for the shooting by many news outlets and watchdog groups as a result.Later in 2006, Megadeth performed live in Montreal, and responded to the blame that had been placed on the band and their music as a result. Band leader Dave Mustaine told the crowd:The guy who went to Dawson College and shot everyone, it's terrible. Aside from the fact that what he did was wrong, we have a relationship with Montreal, and that really pissed us off.Before the concert in an interview for CBC News Mustaine said:I was so angry that this guy would use my song, and that he would try and turn that beautiful song into something ugly and nasty. It's for those who lost their lives, and it's a gift to those who are in the process of healing (...) and Gill was not worthy of being a Megadeth fan.[51]This is the ninth mass killing[52] to implicate the movie Natural Born Killers, per the gunman's blog at vampirefreaks.com, which he called one of his favourites. At some point prior to September 20, 2006, the blog was deleted.Coordinates: 45°29′22″N 73°35′14″W﻿ / ﻿45.48944°N 73.58722°W﻿ / 45.48944, -73.58722"

David J. Howe;"David J. Howe is a British writer, journalist, publisher, and media historian.David Howe was born 24 August 1961 and established himself (in the early 1980s) as an authoritative media historian through writing articles for fanzines (notably The Frame) and other publications. In the early 1990s, he began to write the first in-depth critical texts of the British television series Doctor Who, and as a result has become closely associated with the show's history.[1][2] He has written or co-written over thirty titles about the show, and continues to be involved with a variety of publications, often acting as consultant or reviewer.In particular, Howe collaborated on some of the key texts in Virgin Publishing's range of Doctor Who reference works, including the three Decades books (with Stephen James Walker and Mark Stammers), considered to be some of the most in-depth works about the production history of the show.[1][2][3] The same authors followed these with guide books which covered the individual tenures of each Doctor in turn.[2]Howe and Stephen James Walker set up the publishing house Telos Publishing in 2000. The first publication under the Telos name was the first edition of Howe's Transcendental Toybox, written by Howe and Arnold T. Blumberg.[4] (A later edition was described by the BBC's Doctor Who website as a "definitive collector's guide to Doctor Who merchandise".)[5] Telos' second publication was a collection of tie-in fiction to the Channel 5 horror series Urban Gothic. Telos published Doctor Who novellas from 2001 to 2004, when BBC Worldwide declined to renew its license.[1][6] Telos continues to publish non-Doctor Who works and unofficial Doctor Who reference works, including The Handbook, collecting the previously written Virgin Publishing guide books Doctor Who The Handbook in one volume in 2005, and the 2003 book The Television Companion (by Howe and Walker, and previously released as Doctor Who: The Television Companion in 1998 by BBC Publishing, the BBC Doctor Who website described it as the "definitive guide to Doctor Who").[7] In 2007–2008, Howe also served as the editor for Time's Champion, an independent Doctor Who novel based on Craig Hinton's final unpublished novel and completed by his friend Chris McKeon, which features the Sixth Doctor and the Valeyard.Howe also wrote Dæmos Rising, an original film directed by Keith Barnfarther.[1] He also wrote a story for the first Virgin Decalog short story collection, his only piece of licensed Doctor Who fiction to be published. He continues to work as co-director of Telos Publishing, which has expanded to publish a wide range of classic and new science fiction stories. In 2011 Howe published talespinning, a collection of short fiction, including several horror stories, Doctor Who fiction and drabbles.[8][9]Howe also has one of the largest collections of Doctor Who merchandise in the world.[1] His collection was featured in the television programme Collectors Lot and on a special Doctor Who edition of Antiques Roadshow.[10]Aside from his Doctor Who work, Howe was the reviews editor for the horror film magazine Shivers from 1994 to 2008, when it ceased publication. He was also a contributing editor to Starburst magazine from 1984 to 2001, and edited the book reviews column for that magazine for sixteen years. Howe has also contributed reviews, articles and interviews to publications including Fear, Dreamwatch, Infinity, The Stage, The Dark Side, Doctor Who Magazine, The Guardian, Film Review, SFX, Sci-Fi Entertainment, Collectors' Gazette, Death Ray, Doctor Who Insider and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

New Durham, North Bergen;"New Durham is a neighborhood in North Bergen Township in Hudson County, New Jersey, United States.[2][3] It is located near the foot of Union Turnpike and Bergen Turnpike, and south of the Tonnelle Avenue Station of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail. It is one of the few residential areas along the otherwise industrial/commercial Tonnelle Ave, and site of one of the town's main post offices.[4][5]The area was the site of the colonial American community centered on the Three Pigeons when most of North Hudson was called Bergen Woods, a name recalled in  Bergenwood Section on the steep slopes of the west side of the Hudson Palisades. Bergen Turnpike was one of the plank roads Hackensack Plank Road, crossing the Bergen Hill and the Hackensack Meadows that joined the village at Bergen Square with that at Hackenack that had been made the county seat of then much larger Bergen County in 1710. A congregation, established in the 1800s, still uses the name for their church.[6][7]New Durham was a station stop on New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway's route into Pavonia Terminal, just north of Homestead and the Susquehanna Transfer.[8][9]The Meadowview Section of North Bergen rises to the east of New Durham to the Municipal Building on Kennedy Boulevard. This neighborhood is nestled between the many cemeteries-Flower Hill Cemetery, Grove Church Cemetery, Hoboken Cemetery, Macphelah Cemetery and Weehawken Cemetery, that characterize the area and collectively constitute one of the largest green open spaces in the otherwise densely populated North Hudson area.[5]"

New Bucks Head;"New Bucks Head is a stadium in Wellington, Shropshire, England and the home of Conference National football club AFC Telford United. It was originally built for Telford United to play at before they went bankrupt. The stadium is on the same site as the original Bucks Head, which had been home to Telford United and Wellington Town for over a century. The stadium was completed in 2003, and has a capacity of 6,300. It is covered on three out of four sides. The stadium lease and assets are currently held by Telford and Wrekin Council.Until 2020, the stadium regularly hosted Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. reserve fixtures.[1] When Steven Gerrard returned from injury in the Liverpool Reserves it attracted one of the biggest crowds the stadium has ever seen.[2] The stadium played host to the National youth lions cup final in the 2006–07 season involving Sandiacre Town and Milton United.[citation needed] It has also been used for international football, hosting England U16's against Wales U16's in the Victory Shield.The Sir Stephen Roberts Stand (Main Stand) is all seated and covered, with capacity for 2,200 spectators.

The stand is named after former club chairman Sir Stephen Roberts, an entrepreneurial Shropshire farmer who served as chairman of the Milk Marketing Board for over a decade.[3]The Frank Nagington Stand is situated at the southern end of the stadium. This section was usually only opened when a larger than average crowd, or a particularly large away support, was expected. However it is now open at all games to away fans due to the higher number of travelling fans in the conference.The David Hutchison or 'The Hutch' is where the more "die hard" fans stand and is the noisiest part of the stadium on matchdays. It is situated at the northern end of the ground and can hold a capacity of 1,100 spectators.England was the selected country for the U17 Women's championship's in 2013/14. The New Bucks Head Stadium home to AFC Telford United was selected with three other stadiums in England to host the UEFA tournament.

Al-Sindiyana;"Al-Sindiyana (Arabic: السنديانة, Es Sindiyâna) was a Palestinian Arab village in the Haifa Subdistrict. It was depopulated during the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine on May 12, 1948. It was located 29 km south of Haifa.On 16 March 1799, during the  Ottoman era,   Napoleon had a battle here just north of the village.[6]In 1859, the population was estimated to be 300, who cultivated 22 feddans of land.[7]Victor Guérin visited the village in 1863. Transcribing its name as Sendianeh, he notes there are 400 inhabitants and that its name must derive from the Arabic word sendian, meaning "evergreen oak", as these abound on the hills flanking the village.[8]In 1882, the  PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Sindianeh as a "village of moderate size on high ground, with a spring below it, and a cave, it was here that the tunnel of the Cæsarea aqueduct is said to have broken into by women digging for clay".[7]A population list from about 1887 showed that Al-Sindiyana had about 520 inhabitants, all Muslims.[9]In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the  British Mandate authorities,  Al Sendianeh had a population of 576, all Muslims,[10]  increasing in the 1931 census to 923, 922 Muslim and 1 Jew, in a total of  217 houses.[11]Al-Sindiyana had an elementary school for boys, which by  1942-1943 had 200 students. The village had several wells and springs.[12]In  the 1945 statistics it had a population of 1,250 Muslims,[3]  with a total of 15,172 dunams of land.[13] Of this, a total of 8,177 dunums of land was allocated to cereals, 225 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards,[14]  while 24 dunams were built-up (urban) land.[15]Al-Sindiyana 1942 1:20,000Al-Sindiyana 1945 1:250,000Children from Al-Sindiyana and Meir Shfeya (Jewish youth village) playing together, 1931In 1992 the village site was described: "The site is fenced in with barbed wire.

Carlo Bergonzi (tenor);"Carlo Bergonzi (13 July 1924 – 25 July 2014)[1] was an Italian operatic tenor. Although he performed and recorded some bel canto and verismo roles, he was above all associated with the operas of Giuseppe Verdi, including many of the composer's lesser known works he helped revive.  He sang more than forty other roles throughout his career.[2][3]Bergonzi was born in Polesine Parmense,[4] near Parma in Northern Italy, on 13 July 1924. He was an only child.[4] He later claimed he saw his first opera, Verdi’s Il trovatore, when he was  six years old. He sang in church, and soon he began to appear in children's opera roles in Busseto, a nearby town. After he left school at age 11 he began working in a Parma cheese factory. His father worked there too, and Carlo often got into trouble for singing.At the age of 16, he began his vocal studies as a baritone at Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Parma with Maestro Ettore Campogalliani.[5]During World War II, Bergonzi became involved in anti-Nazi activities and was interned in a German prisoner-of-war camp in 1943. Two years later, he was freed by the Russians and walked 106 km in order to reach an American camp. However, while on his way, he drank unboiled water and contracted typhoid fever, from which he recovered within a year.[4] After the war he returned to the Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Parma, weighing just over 36 kilograms (80 pounds).[3]In a 1985 interview with Opera Fanatic's Stefan Zucker, Bergonzi cited 1948 as the year of his professional debut, as a baritone.[6] He sang the role of Figaro in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, which he performed with a former prisoners' association which he joined after the war. It has been noted that the fee of 2,000 lire paid for his professional debut was insufficient to cover his meals and travel.[4]Other baritone roles which he undertook included those of Metifio in L'arlesiana, Doctor Malatesta in Don Pasquale, Belcore in L'elisir d'amore, Enrico Ashton in Lucia di Lammermoor , Ghirlino in Le astuzie di Bertoldo, Silvio in Pagliacci, David in L'amico Fritz, Alfio in Cavalleria rusticana, Albert in Werther, Marcello in La bohème, Sonora in La fanciulla del West, Sharpless in Madama Butterfly, Lescaut in Manon Lescaut, Laerte in Mignon,  the title role in Rigoletto, and Georgio Germont in La traviata.However, he realized that the tenor repertoire was more suited to his voice, and after retraining, he made his debut as a tenor in the title role of Andrea Chénier at the Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari in 1951.[2] That same year, Bergonzi sang at the Coliseum in Rome in a 50th anniversary concert of Verdi's death[7] and the Italian state radio network RAI engaged Bergonzi for a series of broadcasts of the lesser-known Verdi operas for the same purpose.  These included  I due Foscari[8] as well as Giovanna d'Arco and Simon Boccanegra.[9]In 1953, Bergonzi made his La Scala debut, creating the title role in Jacopo Napoli's opera Mas' Aniello which was based on the life of Tommaso Aniello, the 17th-century Italian fisherman-turned-revolutionary.[3] His London debut as Alvaro in La forza del destino took place at the Stoll Theatre in 1953.[2] His American debut was at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1955, and his Metropolitan Opera debut as Radamès in Aida came on 13 November 1956 when he (and Antonietta Stella) received a positive reaction from Howard Taubman in The New York Times.[10] Bergonzi continued to sing at the Met for 32 years, his last performance there occurring on 12 November 1988 in the role of Edgardo in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.He sang the role of Radames again for his debut with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company in 1961 and in 1962 he reprised the role of Alvaro for his debut with the Royal Opera, Covent Garden. He made his debut with the San Francisco Opera in 1969 as Don Alvaro in La forza del destino.Bergonzi pursued a busy international career in the opera house and recording studio during the 1960s. His chief Italian tenor rivals in this period were Franco Corelli and Mario Del Monaco. Bergonzi outlasted all three, continuing to sing through the 1970s at major opera houses. But in the 1980s, as his own vocal quality deteriorated inevitably with age, he concentrated on recital work. In 1996, Bergonzi participated in conductor James Levine's 25th anniversary gala at the Metropolitan Opera. He gave his American farewell concert at Carnegie Hall on 17 April that same year.However, an announcement that on 3 May 2000, he was to sing the title role in a concert performance of Verdi's Otello, conducted by Eve Queler and the Opera Orchestra of New York, attracted intense interest, particularly because he had never performed the demanding role on stage. Amongst others, the audience included Anna Moffo, Licia Albanese, Sherrill Milnes, José Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti.[3] Bergonzi was unable to finish the performance, supposedly suffering irritation from the air-conditioning in his dressing room. He withdrew after two acts, leaving the remaining two to be sung by Antonio Barasorda, a substitute singer. This performance was by wide critical consensus seen as a disaster.[3]After retiring, Bergonzi is credited with mentoring tenors Roberto Aronica, Giuliano Ciannella, Berle Sanford Rosenberg, Vincenzo La Scola, Filippo Lo Giudice, Philip Webb, Giorgio Casciari, Paul Caragiulo, Lance Clinker, Fernando del Valle and Salvatore Licitra. Soprano Frances Ginsberg was also one of his pupils.Bergonzi left a legacy of many recordings of individual arias and complete operas, including works by Verdi, Puccini, Mascagni and Leoncavallo. However, of his early baritone roles, few of his audio recordings still exist.[3]In The New York Times obituary, Peter G. Davis, who reviewed a 1978 Carnegie Hall recital by Bergonzi in The Times is quoted as noting:Alan Blyth, in his Gramophone survey of Bergonzi's greatest recordings, sums up the qualities of Bergonzi's voice:In 1950 Bergonzi married Adele Aimi, with whom he had two sons, Maurizio and Marco, the former was born on the day Bergonzi made his tenor debut. Bergonzi owned homes in both Milan and Busseto, in addition to a restaurant and hotel in the latter, the "I Due Foscari", named after the Verdi opera about Venetian court intrigue.[3]Bergonzi died on 25 July 2014, twelve days after his 90th birthday, in the Auxologico Institution in Milan. He was buried in the Vidalenzo Cemetery.[12]NotesSources"
William Jones (deputy governor);"William Jones (March 20, 1624 - October 17, 1706) was an English lawyer who emigrated to the United Colonies and became the twenty-fourth Deputy Governor of the Colony of Connecticut.Jones was born in London, Middlesex, England. He became a lawyer at Westminster and married Hannah Eaton, daughter of Governor Eaton, on July 4, 1659, in St. Andrew's Church, Holborn, by Reverend Joseph Rowe.[1] They arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 27, 1660, in company with the regicides, judges Edward Whalley and William Goffe. They moved to New Haven in August of the same year, took possession of the mansion of Governor Theophilus Eaton, and continued to live there until their deaths.[2] Jones was made a freeman in 1661. One of the most interesting facts in his life was his connection with the two judges, Whalley and Goffe. During their hiding in New Haven, Jones' house was their place of refuge for eleven days. The honors seem to have been shared with Reverend John Davenport during this exciting episode in  New Haven.[3]Jones and his wife Hannah had thirteen children, four of whom died their first year, Theophilus, Samuel, Rebecca  and  Abigail, one of whom died at three years, Deodat. The eight who reached maturity were William, Nathaniel, Hannah, Elizabeth, Sarah, John, Isaac, and Susanna.For twenty-eight years, Jones was elected to the office of Assistant, or Magistrate, of the United Colonies. This office combined the duties of a Magistrate with those of a Senator, or member of the Superior House of the Legislature, except during 1685, when Governor Andrews of New York suspended the government of Connecticut.Jones was elected Deputy-Governor of New Haven in 1664. On the union of this Colony with Connecticut, May 11, 1665, he was chosen one of the magistrates. In July 1691, following the death of James Bishop, Jones was elected Lieutenant Governor by the General Assembly. He was elected to the same office by the freemen in 1692, and was elected each year from 1692 until he retired on May 12, 1698.[4]Chosen Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Connecticut in 1689 and reelected each of the next five years, Jones was one of the trustees granted the patent of the city of New Haven by the General Assembly of Connecticut on October 20, 1704.[5]Jones died on October 17, 1706, in New Haven, Connecticut at the age of 82.[6] Jones and his wife Hannah were buried near her father, Governor Eaton of New Haven, Connecticut.[7]"

Questions sur les Miracles;"Questions sur les Miracles, also known as Lettres sur les Miracles (Questions/Letters on miracles), is a series of pamphlets published by the French philosopher and author Voltaire. In these pamphlets Voltaire expresses many themes, including primarily his arguments against other recent pamphlets that had discussed religious miracles. Voltaire, in his responses found it ridiculous that God would occasionally violate nature's laws for a particular reason.  Voltaire's first pamphlet was published July 1765, and during the course of that year, he published nineteen more.  The pamphlets were published anonymously, and signed pseudonymously.[1][2]Questions sur les Miracles starts with theological questions, but moves on to repeat some of the defences of democracy and free expression that Voltaire had proposed in his earlier Idées républicaines:[2]"Let us uphold the liberty of the press, it is the basis of all other liberties, through it we enlighten each other."[2]A number of the letters satirically express Voltaire's criticisms of the English biologist John Needham who had promoted the idea of spontaneous generation, of the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and of the authorities at Geneva who had resisted greater democracy.[3][4] Voltaire uses irony and sarcasm to convey his sceptical opinion on miracles, one letter poses that miracles are authentic and, with exaggerated optimism, hopes that priests will manifest them. "We even hope that not only will these learned men work miracles, but that they will hang all those who do not believe in them. Amen!"[4] Voltaire thought that the miracles of Jesus should be seen as moral lessons rather than real events.[5]Needham was in Geneva in 1765 when he ran across Voltaire's anonymously written pamphlets, which Voltaire began as responses to Protestant pastor David Claparède's 1765 pamphlet Considérations sur les miracles. Claparède's publication was a reply to Rousseau's 1764 pamphlet Lettres écrites de la Montagne. All these publications considered religious miracles—if they were possible and what they meant.Voltaire, who had been living at Ferney just outside of Geneva, wrote twenty of these pamphlets by the end of 1765. They attacked Calvinist religious dogmas, discussed religious massacres and martyrdoms, and discussed the local politics of Geneva.Voltaire said it was ridiculous to think that God would make the sun hold still, thus violating the laws of the physic, just so that Joshua would be able to commit a massacre. The only reason, Volitaire suggested, must have been "so that on this small pile of mud called earth, the Popes might finally seize Rome, the benedictines might become too rich, Anne du Bourg might be hanged in Paris and Servetus be burned alive in Geneva.”Needham began to respond to Voltaire's anonymous pamphlets with three anonymous pamphlets of his own. The identities of each author soon became known and personal attacks ensued.[1]An often quoted passage from the Questions sur les Miracles regards sacrificing reason and standing up to power:Once your faith, sir, persuades you to believe what your intelligence declares to be absurd, beware lest you likewise sacrifice your reason in the conduct of your life. In days gone by, there were people who said to us: "You believe in incomprehensible, contradictory and impossible things because we have commanded you to, now then, commit unjust acts because we likewise order you to do so." Nothing could be more convincing. Certainly anyone who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices. … Once a single faculty of your soul has been tyrannized, all the other faculties will submit to the same fate.[6]One surviving copy has extensive notes by Voltaire on just the first letter, suggesting that he intended to revise the book into the form of a treatise rather than series of letters, but never completed this.[5]"
1979–80 Los Angeles Kings season;"The 1979–80 Los Angeles Kings season was the Kings' 13th season in the National Hockey League. It saw the Kings qualify for the playoffs, placing second in the Norris Division, but they lost in the first round to the New York Islanders. Just prior to the end of the season, the Kings sent Butch Goring to the Islanders for Billy Harris and Dave Lewis.  Goring would help the Islanders defeat the Kings on their way to their first of 4 Stanley Cup wins.  They also had the worst penalty kill percentage in a season in the history of the NHL at 67.70%.[1]Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals againstNote: Teams that qualified for the playoffs are highlighted in bold.[2]The Kings were involved in the following transactions during the 1979–80 season.

Meniscal cyst;"Meniscal cyst is a well-defined cystic lesion located along the peripheral margin of the meniscus, a part of the knee, nearly always associated with horizontal meniscal tears.Pain and swelling or focal mass at the level of the joint. The pain may be related to a meniscal tear or distension of the knee capsule or both. The mass varies in consistency from soft/fluctuant to hard. Size is variable, and meniscal cysts are known to change in size with knee flexion/extension.Various etiologies have been proposed, including trauma, hemorrhage, chronic infection, and mucoid degeneration. The most widely accepted theory describes meniscal cysts resulting from extrusion of synovial fluid through a peripherally extended horizontal meniscal tear, accumulating outside the joint capsule. They arise more commonly from the lateral joint margin, and occur most often in 20- to 40-year-old males.Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for diagnosis of meniscal cysts. In their most subtle form, meniscal cysts present as focal areas of high signal intensity within a swollen meniscus. It is not uncommon for radiologists to miss this type of meniscal cyst because the signal intensity is not quite as great as fluid on T2 weighted sequences.2 When this fluid is extruded into the adjacent soft tissues, the swollen meniscus subsequently assumes a more normal shape, and the extruded fluid demonstrates a higher T2 signal typical of parameniscal cysts. Medial meniscus horizontal tear extending into a meniscal cyst.Sagittal T2 images of a medial meniscus horizontal tear extending into a meniscal cyst.Large medial meniscus cyst.Treatment of meniscal cysts consists of a combination of cyst decompression (intraarticular decompression versus open cystectomy) and arthroscopic repair of any meniscal abnormalities. Success rates are significantly higher when both the cyst and meniscal tear are treated compared to treating only one disease process."

John and Julia Hevener House;"The John and Julia Hevener House is a single-family home located at 1444 West Genesee in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1]John Hevener was born in 1842. In the mid-1860s, he became a business partner of Enoch J. White, one of Lapeer's founding settlers. The two men founded and ran ahighly successful general store. Henever served at various times as Mayor of Lapeer, Superintendent of the County Poor, Board of Education Secretary, and Trustee of School District #2. John and Julia Hevener purchased this lot from Enoch White in 1884, and constructed this house. They lived in the house for nearly 30 years. In the 20th century, the house was converted into doctor's offices and then into apartments. It was later restored as a single family dwelling.[2]The Hevener House is one of the most elaborate Queen Anne-styled residences in Lapeer, distinguished by the ornateness, complexity and delicacy of its Queen Anne-inspired detailing. It is a two-and-one-half-story house with irregular massing, varied exterior wood surfacetreatments, and a large wrap-around porch with decorative supports. The house sits on a stone foundation and is covered with clapboard, and shingling and vergeboards in the main gables, gable corners, and gabled pediments of the porch roof. There is a bay window on one east facade and small pointed attic windows in the gable ends.[2]"

1976 Progressive Conservative leadership election;"Robert StanfieldJoe ClarkThe 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership election was held at the Ottawa Civic Centre in Ottawa on February 22, 1976,[1] to elect a leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to replace Robert Stanfield, who had resigned after losing the 1968, 1972, and 1974 elections. It unexpectedly elected a 36-year-old, little-known PC Member of Parliament from Alberta as the party's new leader. Joe Clark defeated Claude Wagner on the fourth ballot of the convention by a margin of 65 votes.[1]The convention's delegates were elected by the party's riding associations, along with the party's youth, campus and women's associations. There were also numerous ex officio delegates, including PC Members of Parliament, defeated candidates from the previous election, members of provincial legislatures, members of the party's national executive and the executives of provincial parties affiliated to the federal party. Delegates cast secret ballots, so their votes were not "tied" to any candidate. After each ballot, the candidate winning the fewest votes was removed from the ballot for the next round. Several candidates withdrew voluntarily when it became clear that they would not be able to win.Richard Quittenton, president of St. Clair College in Windsor, had also been a candidate but withdrew before the first ballot and endorsed Wagner.The first ballot was widely expected to be a close contest between Wagner and MacDonald, though it was thought unlikely that either of them would have a decisive lead. The result proved a shock to everyone at the convention, as while Wagner did about as well as had been expected, MacDonald did far worse than even the most pessimistic predictions had indicated, coming in sixth place, the phenomenon of delegates promising their votes to one candidate and then voting for another has become known in Canadian politics as the "Flora Syndrome". Mulroney was slightly ahead of the rest of the chasing pack, but still over seven percentage points behind Wagner, who was now the clear front-runner. Grafftey was automatically eliminated after finishing in last place, with Gillies and Stevens dropping out of their own accord, all three endorsed Clark.While Wagner extended his delegate count on the second ballot, Clark saw the most dramatic improvement in his delegate count, nearly doubling it from the first round. Mulroney dropped down to third place and made only minimal gains. MacDonald, having remained on the second ballot in the hope that she might pick up some Red Tory delegates from the candidates who dropped out, likewise earned only a small number of extra delegates, realizing that the situation was hopeless and that she would most likely be eliminated next if she remained on the ballot, she withdrew and threw her support behind Clark, as did Fraser, who was automatically eliminated in this round. Nowlan withdrew and initially intended to endorse Horner, but the latter, sensing that the momentum was with Clark, persuaded Nowlan that they should both endorse Wagner to prevent a split in the right-wing vote. Hellyer followed their lead and also endorsed Wagner.The third round had Wagner continuing to lead, but only barely, with both he and Clark having picked up large numbers of delegates since the previous round, albeit Clark having done slightly better in that regard. Conversely, any momentum that Mulroney had completely stalled, causing him to actually lose delegates and be automatically eliminated. While it was now clear that Mulroney was in a position to be the kingmaker, he simply left the convention after his elimination was announced and did not endorse either Wagner or Clark, this created an unpredictable scenario, as about half of Mulroney's delegates were favourable to Wagner because he was a fellow Quebecer, while the remaining half were favourable to Clark due to his political positions being closer to Mulroney's.Ultimately, Mulroney's delegates were sufficiently favourable to Clark to afford him a narrow victory on the final ballot. Clark's majority over Wagner was just 2.8%, making this the most closely contested election for the leadership of a major Canadian political party until that point, surpassed in the years since only by Andrew Scheer's victory over Maxime Bernier (with a majority of 1.9%) in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election."
South Morang, Victoria;"South Morang is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 21 km north-east of Melbourne's central business district, located within the City of Whittlesea local government area. South Morang recorded a population of 24,989 at the 2021 census.Originally known as Morang South,[2] South Morang grew from a country area on the outskirts of Melbourne in the late 1990s/early 2000s to a suburban area with new estates being developed.Before the arrival of European explorers and farmers, the area now called South Morang was inhabited by the Wurundjeri balug and Wurundjeri Willam clans. South Morang was originally known as 'Morang South' until Morang itself was renamed by the locals to Yan Yean South in 1893 - as it is the suburb lying directly below Yan Yean. ‘Morang’ is an ancient aboriginal word meaning ‘sky’ or ‘cloud’. In 1824, William Hovell and Hamilton Hume were the first Europeans to set foot in what is now the City of Whittlesea when they were going from Sydney to Port Philip Bay. On 14 December 1824, they wrote in their journals:The description showed that the land was good for farming, and it was settled by John Batman's pastoral group in the 1830s. Robert Hoddle surveyed the land in 1837. The land failed to sell at first and was opened to pastoral leases. It was leased by William Forlonge in 1846.[4] By 1840, the area was owned by rich landowners. By the 1850s, the area was used for farming. Much evidence of the farming, such as dry stone walls, can still be seen today. In 1852, William Ford Cleeland bought 256 hectares and sundivided and sold the land, doubling his money. Individual land holdings have decreased in size over time.[4]Morang South Post Office opened on 24 November 1873. The post office has now moved to Westfield Plenty Valley.[5]The railway from Melbourne to here was finished in 1889. The old South Morang railway station served the Whittlesea steam railway line until the 1950s. It was further north than the current station.Mill Park Library is the nearest public library and is managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library.The South Morang Farmers & Makers Market was launched in May 2019.[6]Carome Homestead is home to Two Beans and a Farm cafe and the Mernda Community Garden at Carome.[7]South Morang's ethnically diverse surrounding suburbs (such as Mill Park and Epping) have added to its ethnic diversity as residents of those suburbs move to South Morang.The most common ancestries in South Morang (According to the 2016 census[8]) were Australian born 17.0%, English 16.3%, Italian 12.8%, Indian 6.2% and Macedonian 5.4%.South Morang is also home to many sites of historical and cultural significance and figures, such as Farm Vigano[9] and Le Page Homestead[10] at Plenty Gorge Park[11]The Lakes South Morang P-9 School opened in 2007.South Morang is served by South Morang, Middle Gorge, and Hawkstowe railway stations, all of which are located on the Mernda railway line. The suburb is also served by numerous bus routes.South Morang Football Club, an Australian rules football team, competes in the Northern Football League and are based at Mill Park Lakes.[12] Brownlow medallist Kevin Murray played football for South Morang after his retirement from the AFL.[13]It is also home to the Northern District Softball Association with multiple clubs playing at its site in Mill Park.^ = territory divided with another LGA"
Unbanked;"The unbanked are adults who do not have their own bank accounts. Along with the underbanked, they may rely on alternative financial services for their financial needs, where these are available.Some reasons a person might not have a bank account include:[citation needed]The unbanked are described by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as those adults without an account at a bank or other financial institution and are considered to be outside the mainstream for one reason or another.  The Federal Reserve estimated there are 55 million unbanked or underbanked adult Americans in 2018, which account for 22 percent of U.S. households.[2][3]One report found the nationwide rates to be 7.7% unbanked and 17.9% underbanked, with the most unbanked state Mississippi, at 16.4%.  Places where over 20% of residents have no bank accounts include Miami, Florida, Detroit, Michigan, Laredo, Texas, Newark, New Jersey, Hialeah, Florida, Hidalgo County, Texas, The Bronx, and Cameron County, Texas.  Many counties with fewer than 100,000 residents had even higher rates, including Starr County, Texas, at 32.7%.  Some census tracts in Savannah, Georgia, Cleveland, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia had over 40% unbanked residents.[4]The majority of the unbanked and underbanked are American-born while a growing number are immigrants where the two groups have low income as a commonality and lack the minimum balance to open checking and savings accounts.[5]According to Congressman Rubén Hinojosa, half of the unbanked had a bank account previously but are choosing to not have an account and opting to using the services of check cashers and payday lenders instead. Research has shown that immigrants who have experienced a banking crisis in their countries of origin are significantly less likely to have bank accounts in the U.S.,[6] and researchers also found that lower rates of financial market participation tend to persist even for immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for several years.[7] Attributes that contribute to these decisions, however, vary for each racial/ethnic group.[8]Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger started the Bank on California initiative to help the unbanked in 2008.  Previously, in 2001, a financial education curriculum called Money Smart was launched by the FDIC to help the financially unsavvy.[9]Economist Lisa Servon comments that lack of financial education as a reason for using services other than banks is often an inaccurate stereotype.[1]Prior to becoming the FDIC chair in 2006, Sheila Bair ran a research project for the Inter-American Development Bank at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to discover ways to help unbanked Latin American immigrants use the U.S. banking system.  She found that the primary reason recent Latino immigrants often do not use banks to remit money is because they are undocumented.  Around the same time, the Treasury Department put in place Section 326 regulations that allow banks and credit unions to accept identification from foreign governments at their own discretion.[10]  Banks like Mitchell Bank in Milwaukee have taken up the Treasury Department on their relaxing of identification standards.  They have even "offered pamphlets on how to apply for a Wisconsin state ID and driver's license, and invited the Mexican consulate in Chicago to visit with a mobile unit that issues 'matricula' cards".[11]  In Chicago, the Consul General of Mexico, Carlos Sada, estimated that up to 25% of applicants of the Matricula Consular ID apply in order use it to acquire U.S. bank accounts.[12]A U.S. federal law signed in 1996 contained a provision that required the federal government to make electronic payments by 1999. As a part of implementation of the provision, in 2008 the U.S. Treasury Department paired with Comerica Bank to offer the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The card is used to make payments to federal benefit recipients who do not have a bank account.[13]As of 2017, approximately 1.7 billion people remain unbanked in emerging economies.[where?][vague] This number has decreased from 2.5 billion people in 2014.

HMIS Baluchistan (J182);"HMIS Baluchistan (J182) was a  Bangor-class minesweeper built for the Royal Navy, but transferred to the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) during the Second World War.The Bangor class was designed as a small minesweeper that could be easily built in large numbers by civilian shipyards, as steam turbines were difficult to manufacture, the ships were designed to accept a wide variety of engines. Baluchistan displaced 656 long tons (667 t) at standard load and 820 long tons (830 t) at deep load. The ship had an overall length of 174 feet (53.0 m), a beam of 28 feet 6 inches (8.7 m) and a draught of 10 feet 3 inches (3.1 m).[1] The ship's complement consisted of 60 officers and ratings.[2]She was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of 2,000 shaft horsepower (1,500 kW) and gave a maximum speed of 16 knots (30 km/h, 18 mph). Baluchistan carried a maximum of 160 long tons (163 t) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 2,800 nautical miles (5,200 km, 3,200 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h, 12 mph).[3]The turbine-powered Bangors were armed with a 12 pounder 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun and a single QF 2-pounder (4 cm) AA gun. In some ships the 2-pounder was replaced a single or twin  20 mm Oerlikon AA gun, while most ships were fitted with four additional single Oerlikon mounts over the course of the war.[3] For escort work, her minesweeping gear could be exchanged for around 40 depth charges.[2]HMIS Baluchistan was originally ordered from the Blyth Shipbuilding Company for the Royal Navy as HMS Greenock in 1939. However, before she was launched, she was transferred to the Royal Indian Navy and eventually commissioned as Baluchistan.[4] She served in the RIN during World War II. Baluchistan was a part of the Eastern Fleet, and escorted numerous convoys between Africa, British India and Australia in 1943-45.[5][6][7]After the independence, she was among the vessels transferred to Pakistan, where she was renamed PNS Baluchistan."

Joe Donoghue;"Joseph F. Donoghue (February 11, 1871 – April 1, 1921[1]) was an American speed skater. He became the speed skating World Champion in 1891 and was a member of the Manhattan Athletic Club.[2]Joe Donoghue skated on ice-skates with longer irons than did the other skaters in his time. This gave him an advantage because he did not need to swing with his arms.[3]Joe Donoghue came from a family of skaters. His father Timothy Donoghue was an American champion in 1864 and a pioneer skate designer, and of his sons Timothy Jr, Joe and James competed as speed skaters. In 1889, at age 18, Joe Donoghue traveled to Russia where he raced against the Russian champion Alexander Panshin.[4]Timothy Donoghue Sr on skating techniques in windy or windless conditions and the difference between Joe Donoghue's and Alexander Panshin's skating in the February 10, 1889 issue of the Pittsburg Dispatch (page 11): "A good skater will always have the wind against him, for he goes faster than an ordinary breeze. Going before the wind a man can make 33 per cent better time than on a calm day. When the wind is against a man it is desirable to present as little surface to it as possible. For this reason I have taught the boys to skate with their arms folded behind them. With our long skate we make long strokes. Von Panschin, in spite of his size, makes 30 strokes to Joe's 20 while they are skating."Source: SpeedSkatingStats.com[5]"

Tomb of Philippe Pot;"The Tomb of Philippe Pot is a 15th-century funerary monument commissioned by Philippe Pot (d. 1493), royal steward of Burgundy under Louis XI, between c. 1477 and 1480 for his burial at the chapel of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Cîteaux Abbey, south of Dijon, France.[2] No definitive attributions have been made as to the artists and craftsmen who created the work, but Antoine Le Moiturier is often suggested to have produced the eight near life-sized mourners.The tomb has eight life-sized pleurants, represented as solemn and hooded pallbearers, each wearing a heavy black coat as they carry Philippe's recumbent effigy towards his grave.[3] Philippe is dressed in armor and a heraldic tunic, with his hands folded in prayer. The tomb is made of polychromed limestone, paint, gold and lead, it measures 181 (width) × 260 (height) × 167 (depth) cm.The tomb was stolen during the French Revolution, and after changing a number of hands was positioned in private gardens in mansions in Dijon in the 19th century. It has been in the collection of the Musée du Louvre since 1899, where it is on permanent display.Philip the Bold (1363–1404) commissioned the first of the Burgundian tombs in the latter part of the 14th century. He hired the Dutch sculptor Claus Sluter, whose distinctive style in which many small pleurants are positioned surrounding the effigy was copied for the next century. Philippe Pot was Philip the Bold's godson, and royal steward and Grand Seneschal to the Dukes of Burgundy. He was raised at the Burgundian court, where he was educated. His tomb follows the tradition of the earliest ducal tombs, Sluter's influence is evident by the presence of pleurants.[3][4]Philippe Pot reposes on a limestone plate or slab, and is dressed in a knightly helmet, tunic and armor with a gilded breastplate. His head rests on a cushion, his eyes are open and his hands are clasped in prayer. A sword lies to his side while a lion rests at his feet.[1] The eight mourners carrying his body are carved in black stone, and dressed in full-length black-hooded habits. Each bows their head in grief, and each bears an individually designed gilded heraldic shield, which may refer to Philippe's lineage, making the monument of the "Kinship tomb" type.[5] Their poise gives the impression of the slow movement of a funeral procession.[6]The tomb is in good condition, but has been restored in places, a 19th-century engraving shows Philippe's hands broken apart.[7] The carvings on the edge of the slab are written in Gothic script and read CY DEMORRA MESSIR PHILIPPE POT [...] 7BRE AN MIL CCCCXCI [V].[8]Although the monument is the last known tomb of the Burgundian style,[1] it influenced later funerary artworks. The sculptor transformed the conventional size and placement of pleurants, which had been relatively small figures standing in niches around the sarcophagus. Its influence is evidenced by the similar tombs of Louis de Savoisy (d. 1515) and Jacques de Mâlain (d. 1527).[9]The monument was commissioned, perhaps by Philippe himself, to stand over his grave in the north arm of the chapel's transept. The artists and craftsmen involved in its production have not been identified, although the French sculptor Antoine Le Moiturier (active between 1482 and 1502) is often suggested as likely to have created the pleurants, given the similarity of the facial types to identified works of his, as well as, according to art historian Colum Hourihane, the "unusually rigid drapery".[8][10] Guillaume Chandelier has also been suggested as involved, but there is little supporting evidence.[11]The tomb is in poor condition, covered by layers of brown dirt especially around the heraldry, as well as gloss and polyvinyl alcohol from an earlier cleaning. A major restoration, after period of renewed research by the Restoration Center of the Museums of France in 2016–2017, began in mid-2018.[12]The 2018 to 2019 restoration, conducted in situ, is described by the museum as having "remove the bleaching of the surface layer, the lightening of the black layer and phenomena of gloss, the removal of brown fouling of the blazons, the cleaning of the bare stone areas. After a review of this first phase, given the results and additional observations, the second phase provides for the resumption of some closures, the elimination of old retouching, patching and retouching harmonization."[12][13]The tomb was seized by the state during the French Revolution, and sold in 1791 to the Duleu Society and Dardelin of Dijon.[8] It was acquired in 1808 by Charles Richard de Vesvrotte, lord of Ruffey-lès-Beaune, following a legal case against the state. De Vesvrotte placed the tomb in the garden of his hôtel particulier (mansion) in Dijon, the Hôtel Petit de Ruffey.  He then temporarily moved it to a castle grounds in his possession, and then relocated to another of his mansion's gardens.[7]It was purchased by the comte Armand de Vesvrotte in 1886, and by the Louvre in 1899.[7]"
Bi-partisan appointment republican model;"The Bi-partisan appointment republican model is a proposal for Australian constitutional reform. If approved at referendum, the model would have established Australia as a republic with a Head of State appointed by the Australian Federal Parliament. The model was put to the people at the November 1999 republican referendum and was defeated by 54.4% of voters.Under the model, nominations for the Head of State or President could have been made by any Australian citizen or group of citizens. These would have been received by a nominations committee established by Parliament. The committee would provide a report to the Prime Minister on the most suitable candidates for the position. The Prime Minister would select a candidate after securing support from the Leader of the Opposition. This bi-partisan part of the procedure gives the model its name.The formal appointment of the Head of State would have been made in a joint sitting of Parliament, attended by members of both the Senate and House of Representatives. A special two-thirds majority would have been required to ratify the candidate's appointment as Head of State.The powers of the proposed Head of State would not have been substantially different from those of the reigning Monarch and Governor General. The Head of State would have been vested with the powers of executive government, but those powers would have been normally exercised on the advice of ministers.Under the model, the term of the Head of State would have been five years. The Head of State could have been removed by the Prime Minister but this decision would have been subject to confirmation by the House of Representatives within thirty days. Any vacancy in the post would have been temporarily filled by the longest-serving state governor.If implemented, the model would have established an Australian Republic by removing constitutional links to the monarchy. References to either Queen or Governor-General in the Australian constitution would have been replaced by a reference to the President of Australia.Supporters of the model argued that appointed presidents would carry out the presidential duties in a very similar fashion to the current Governor-General, as the method of appointment requires the combined support of the major political parties. The President would continue to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, as to do otherwise would invite dismissal. Consequently, the change to a republic is argued to have minimal impact on the rest of Australia's parliament and government.Although the 1999 referendum was limited to the federal jurisdiction, the model is able to be adopted with little modification by each of the six Australian states to formally break ties with the monarchy.The model was criticised for its lack of democratic qualities. The Head of State is not elected by the people and the Prime Minister may legally ignore all nominations made by ordinary citizens. The model was specifically criticised for allowing the Prime Minister to dismiss the Head of State.The model was also criticised for its bi-partisan mechanism. According to some, the deliberate seeking of support by the Prime Minister to the Opposition Leader, who are by definition political adversaries, may influence the outcome of other policy contests. The mandate implicitly conferred by two-thirds of the parliament may encourage the President to make use of reserve powers.The model was originally developed by legal academic George Winterton, and influenced by systems used in Europe. The central concept was for a President, appointed by a two-thirds majority of parliament. Subsequent to a judicial process, the President could be dismissed by an absolute majority in both houses of parliament. After consulting with other experts, the proposal with drafted amendments was published in the Independent Monthly, March 1992 and was supported by the Australian Republican Movement (ARM).In 1993 the model was reviewed as one of four options by the Republic Advisory Committee, chaired by Malcolm Turnbull who shortly after became ARM chairman. Prime Minister Paul Keating presented a slightly altered version, providing both appointment and dismissal by a two-thirds majority of parliament. He declared that this version, often called the Keating-Turnbull Model, should be put to the people.Under Prime Minister John Howard, the model was closely examined and criticised at the 1998 constitutional convention. The model evolved to incorporate a nominations committee and authority to dismiss the Head of State was taken from the parliament and given to the Prime Minister. With these changes, the model was supported by a simple majority of 73 out of 152 delegates, 22 abstaining. An absolute majority of 89 then agreed it should be put to the people.At the 1999 Australian republic referendum, the model was supported by opposition parties, progressives and some conservatives who feared a future directly elected president, while monarchists and those favouring other republican models rejected it. The referendum failed, with especially large majorities against in rural and outer suburban electorates.After the defeat, the Australian Republican Movement downgraded the model's status from preferred to one of six possible options. Its long-term future is likely to depend on the result of a proposed models plebiscite, which would allow electors to directly show their support for this version of republicanism."

URI fragment;"In computer hypertext, a URI fragment is  a string of characters that refers to a resource that is subordinate to another, primary resource. The primary resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and the fragment identifier points to the subordinate resource.The fragment identifier introduced by a hash mark # is the optional last part of a URL for a document. It is typically used to identify a portion of that document. The generic syntax is specified in RFC ((3986))The hash-mark separator in URIs is not part of the fragment IdentifierIn URIs, a hash mark # introduces the optional fragment near the end of the URL. The generic RFC 3986 syntax for URIs also allows an optional query part introduced by a question mark ?. In URIs with a query and a fragment, the fragment follows the query. Query parts depend on the URI scheme and are evaluated by the server—e.g., http: supports queries unlike ftp:. Fragments depend on the document MIME type and are evaluated by the client (web browser). Clients are not supposed to send URI fragments to servers when they retrieve a document, and without help from a local application.(see below) fragments do not participate in HTTP redirections.[1]A URI ending with # is permitted by the generic syntax and is a kind of empty fragment. In MIME document types such as text/html or any XML type, empty identifiers to match this syntactically legal construct are not permitted. Web browsers typically display the top of the document for an empty fragment.The fragment identifier functions differently to the rest of the URI: its processing is exclusively client-sided with no participation from the web server, though the server typically helps to determine the MIME type, and the MIME type determines the processing of fragments. When an agent (such as a web browser) requests a web resource from a web server, the agent sends the URI to the server, but does not send the fragment. Instead, the agent waits for the server to send the resource, and then the agent processes the resource according to the document type and fragment value.[2]In an HTML web page, the agent will look for an anchor identified with an HTML tag that includes an id= or name= attribute equal to the fragment identifier.Several proposals have been made for fragment identifiers for use with plain text documents (which cannot store anchor metadata), or to refer to locations within HTML documents in which the author has not used anchor tags:"

Arrestin binding to phosphorylated, active receptor prevents receptor stimulation of heterotrimeric G protein transducer proteins, blocking their cellular signaling and resulting in receptor desensitization. Arrestin binding also directs receptors to specific cellular internalization pathways, removing the receptors from the cell surface and also preventing additional activation. Arrestin binding to phosphorylated, active receptor also enables receptor signaling through arrestin partner proteins. Thus the GRK/arrestin system serves as a complex signaling switch for G protein-coupled receptors.[8]GRK6 and the closely related GRK5 phosphorylate receptors at sites that encourage arrestin-mediated signaling rather than arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization, internalization and trafficking (in contrast to GRK2 and GRK3, which have the opposite effect).[9][10] This difference is one basis for pharmacological biased agonism (also called functional selectivity), where a drug binding to a receptor may bias that receptor’s signaling toward a particular subset of the actions stimulated by that receptor.[11][12]GRK6 is widely and relatively evenly expressed throughout the body, but with particularly high expression in immune cells.[6] GRK6 exists in three splice variants that differ in the carboxyl terminal region that regulates membrane association: one form is palmitoylated, another contains a lipid-binding polybasic domain, and the third is truncated and has neither.[13] In the mouse, GRK6 regulates the D2 dopamine receptor in the striatum region of the brain, and loss of GRK6 leads to increased sensitivity to psychostimulant drugs that act through dopamine.[14] Overexpression of GRK6 in the striatum in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease improves drug-induced movement disorder (tardive dyskinesia) symptoms arising from L-DOPA therapy.[15] In mouse immune cells, GRK6 is important for chemotaxis of B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes in response to the chemoattractant CXCL12,[16] and of neutrophils to sites of injury in response to leukotriene B4.[17]2acx: Crystal Structure of G protein coupled receptor kinase 6 bound to AMPPNPThis article on a gene on human chromosome 5 is a stub.

Rottweil (district);"Rottweil is a Landkreis (district) in the middle of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is part of the Schwarzwald-Baar-Heuberg region in the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald regional district. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Freudenstadt, Zollernalbkreis, Tuttlingen, Schwarzwald-Baar and Ortenaukreis.The district dates back to the Oberamt Rottweil, which was created in 1806/08 when the previously free imperial city Rottweil became part of Württemberg. In 1934 it was renamed to Landkreis (district). 1938 the two neighboring districts  Sulz and Oberndorf were dissolved, and most of the district Oberndorf and a small part of Sulz was added to the district Rottweil. During World War II, a series of Nazi concentration camps, collectively known as KZ Schörzingen-Rottweil-Zepfenhan, were located in the area.[2]  In 1973 in another communal reform several municipalities from the districts Horb, Wolfach, Hechingen and Villingendorf were added.The district covers part of the mountains of the Black Forest and the Swabian Alb. The Neckar River bisects the district from south to north as it flows towards the Rhine River.Today, the economy of Rottweil is predominantly medium-sized.[3] The town of Rottweil, the oldest town in Baden-Württemberg, used to be a flourishing imperial city during the Middle Ages.[3]The annual average unemployment rate in Rottweil was 3.4 Percent in 2019.[4]The imperial eagle in the coat of arms derives from the coat of arms of the free imperial city Rottweil. Below the eagle is a deer antler, the symbol of Württemberg, as part of the district belonged to the kingdom Württemberg well before Rottweil itself became part of it.

Huntland, Tennessee;"Huntland is a town in Franklin County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 872 at the 2010 census and 886 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Tullahoma, Tennessee Micropolitan Statistical Area.The town was established in the early 1900s, and is named after an early settler, Clinton Armstrong Hunt. It was incorporated in 1907.[1]  The town is home to a Pre K-12 school, Huntland School.Huntland is located at 35°3′13″N 86°16′7″W﻿ / ﻿35.05361°N 86.26861°W﻿ / 35.05361, -86.26861 (35.053508, -86.268678).[6]  The town is situated primarily around the intersection of State Route 122 and State Route 97, though its boundaries stretch northward to the intersection of State Route 122 and U.S. Route 64.  State Route 122 continues southwestward to Elora, Tennessee, while State Route 97 continues southward into Alabama.The town of Huntland is a beautiful rural community in Middle Tennessee located in the Appalachian foothills of the southwest part of Franklin County. Huntland lies 12 miles south of Winchester, the county seat, 22 miles east of Fayetteville, the Lincoln County seat, 35 miles north of Huntsville, Alabama, and 100 miles south of Nashville, Tennessee’s state capitol. Huntland is governed by five aldermen and meet every third Monday of each month. There is also a planning and zoning commission and an industrial board.Huntland has one of the county’s high schools, established in the very early 1900’s. Huntland School educates students K-12, and presently has about 600 students enrolled. Huntland is proud of its elementary, middle school, and high school. Water for the town is obtained from three wells, and an up to date filtration plant. In the center of the community lies a nice city park, community center and fire hall.[7]According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2), all of it land.The first school, Huntland Academy was built in 1869-70 on what is now John Hunter Highway and Main Street. During this time there were no public school funds for erecting schools, buying equipment, or paying teacher salaries. Under the leadership of two teachers, Miss Mollie Setiff and Professor T.P. Brennon, community interest in Huntland Academy grew.Soon the need for a larger building was evident. Public meetings were held and by various ways and means plans for a larger Huntland Academy were planned. Two local men who owned a timber yard and a sawmill donated the needed materials for constructing a new building. At the same time, Mr. Clinton Hunt donated land located at the corner of Alabama and College Street. The cost of the newly constructed Huntland Academy was $1000.00. The new school, completed in 1880, contained two recreation rooms and a large study hall. Faithful instructors carried on Huntland Academy until 1908 at which time education became publicly funded.In 1907, the Franklin County Board of Education purchased two and one half acres of land for $250.00 from Gustavas Aldolphus and his wife Mary Bell Gore and her mother Mary Spenser Gore. This land at the corner of Gore and College Streets became the site of Huntland School. Construction began immediately after the purchase. A square, brick two-story building with a large belfry was designed. The new Huntland School consisted of four classrooms, a music conservatory, and two cloakrooms that were located on the first floor. An auditorium and library were on the second floor.Huntland High School was officially established in 1912. In 1914, due to excessive growth, several classrooms were added to the back of the existing building. Again in the late twenties, an addition was needed to accommodate the growing number of students. In 1948, a gymnasium was added to the campus of Huntland School. Between 1936 and 1949 many more building additions were added including five classrooms, an agriculture shop, lunchroom, and a football stadium.Growth in the Huntland community dictated the need for expansion. In 1960, a new elementary building was erected and again in 1969. Growth still increased and various upgrades were made over the next several years. These additions included a larger gymnasium, high school wing, upper elementary, and a larger cafeteria.Between 2001 and 2005 many other additions were constructed on Huntland’s campus. These include a new sports complex which included football, baseball, and softball fields, an elementary gym, music/band room, and a high school wing consisting of eleven instructional classrooms. Currently Huntland Schools’ campus consists of six main buildings, K-1 elementary, 2-4 elementary, 5-8 middle school, agricultural science, high school, and a sports complex building.

Dad's Army (stage show);"Dad's Army: A Nostalgic Music and Laughter Show of Britain's Finest Hour was a 1975 stage adaptation of the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. Following the success of the television programme, the stage show was commissioned by Bernard Delfont in the spring of 1975.Jimmy Perry and David Croft adapted material from the original scripts, making changes to allow for the absence of location filming. The show was in the style of a revue, with songs, familiar scenes from the show, and individual turns for cast members. It was produced by Roger Redfarn, who shared the same agent as the writers.Jeffrey Holland, who would frequently collaborate with Croft in the future, portrayed multiple roles whereas Richard Matthews was cast as the only 2 female roles in the 2007 tour. Croft was particularly pleased with the casting of Jack Haig as Lcpl. Jack Jones as Haig was Croft's 1st choice for the role when they cast the television series.The show opened at the Forum Theatre, Billingham, County Durham on 4 September 1975 for a two-week try out. A local critic wrote of the event:"The special bond of affection between cast and audience helped each item spark along"  - Kevin Eason[1]After cuts and revisions, the show transferred to London's West End and opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre on 2 October 1975. On the opening night there was a surprise appearance by Chesney Allen, singing the old Flanagan and Allen song Hometown with Arthur Lowe.The show ran in the West End from 4 October to 21 February 1976, where it was disrupted twice by bomb scares, and then toured the country until 4 September 1976. The stage show was later revived, billed as Dad’s Army—The Musical, and toured Australia and New Zealand in 2004–2005, starring Jon English.In April 2007 a new Dad's Army stage show was announced. It featured two lost[3] episodes ("The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker" and "A Stripe for Frazer") combined with two additional episodes "Room at the Bottom" (of which only a black-and-white version existed until December 2008) and "The Deadly Attachment".[4] A sequel to the 2007 stage show was announced in December 2009 with the tour starting the following year. It features the same cast as the 2007 show, but has different episodes, including "Branded" and "Mum's Army"."

Dave Parker (rugby);"Dave Parker (1934/35 – 9 November 2018) was a professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1960s having played rugby union at county level in the 1950s. He played at representative level for Great Britain, and at club level for Oldham, as a loose forward.Born in Barrow in Furness, Parker played rugby union while a student at Manchester University and captained both Manchester and the Lancashire representative team before turning professional with Oldham in August 1960.[2]  During his rugby union career he made 24 appearances for Lancashire and was considered one of the best number eights in the country.[3]In a career with Oldham he captained the club to the semi-finals of the 1963-64 Challenge Cup and winning the second division championship in the same season.[2]  He made 198 appearances for Oldham, scoring 34 tries, before an injury in the opening game of the 1967–68 Northern Rugby Football League season against Liverpool City ended his playing career.[2]Parker was capped twice for Great Britain in 1964 playing in two victories against France in March of that year.[2]Parker died on 9 November 2018.[4]"
Eugenie Anderson;"Eugenie Anderson (May 26, 1909 – March 31, 1997), also known as Helen Eugenie Moore Anderson, was a United States diplomat. She is best known as the first woman appointed chief of mission at the ambassador level in US history.[1]Helen Eugenie Moore was born on May 26, 1909, in Adair, Iowa, one of five children of Rev. Ezekial A. Moore, a Methodist minister, and his wife, FloraBelle. She concentrated in music as a student, and attended the Juilliard School in New York, her original hope was to become a concert pianist. She was a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of Pi Beta Phi Women's Fraternity at Simpson College. She transferred to Carleton College in 1929, where she graduated in 1931.[2] It was there she met her husband, John Pierce Anderson, whom she married in 1929 and with whom she had two children, Hans and Johanna.[1][3]Anderson's interest in international affairs had been stirred by a trip to Europe in 1937, where in Germany she first saw a totalitarian state in action, as she recalled. On her return she spoke frequently for the League of Women Voters, fighting the strong isolationist policies of the time.[1]Anderson helped to create the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in 1944. Four years later, as one of the few women, she was elected to an office in the national Democratic Party. In 1948, as the DFL split from the national Democratic Party in a controversy over goals and ideology, she supported Hubert H. Humphrey. She was rewarded for this support in 1949, when she was appointed by President Truman as U.S. ambassador to Denmark (1949–1953).[4][5] Truman's appointment made her the first woman appointed chief of mission at the ambassador level in US history.[6] (The first female chief of mission at the minister rank was Ruth Bryan Owen in 1933). Despite undercurrents of sexism and discomfort in the press with her career flaunting gender roles, she was well-known in Denmark and was sometimes called "Auntie Anderson" by the media. Her popularity and high profile allowed her to exert some political force: she convinced Denmark to make a stronger commitment to NATO, strengthened the Greenland Treaty, and in 1950 became the first American woman to sign a treaty, with the Treaty of Commerce and Friendship with Denmark, which she drafted.[3][7] When she resigned from this position in 1953, King Frederik IX awarded her the Grand Cross of the Order of Dannebrog, a high honor.[8]In 1958 Anderson campaigned for, but did not win, the DFL nomination for U.S. Senator, which ultimately went to Eugene McCarthy.[9] She was later appointed by Kennedy to be ambassador to Bulgaria (1962–1964).[10] Thus Anderson became the first American woman to represent the United States in a country allied with the Soviet Union.After her retirement from these posts, President Johnson appointed Anderson to the United Nations Trusteeship Council and a year later she served on the United Nations Committee for Decolonization.[2]"

Ceramide;"Ceramides are a family of waxy lipid molecules. A ceramide is composed of sphingosine and a fatty acid.  Ceramides are found in high concentrations within the cell membrane of eukaryotic cells, since they are component lipids that make up sphingomyelin, one of the major lipids in the lipid bilayer.[1]  Contrary to previous assumptions that ceramides and other sphingolipids found in cell membrane were purely supporting structural elements, ceramide can participate in a variety of cellular signaling: examples include regulating differentiation, proliferation, and programmed cell death (PCD) of cells.The word ceramide comes from the Latin cera (wax) and amide. Ceramide is a component of vernix caseosa, the waxy or cheese-like white substance found coating the skin of newborn human infants.There are three major pathways of ceramide generation.  First, the sphingomyelinase pathway uses an enzyme to break down sphingomyelin in the cell membrane and release ceramide.  Second, the de novo pathway creates ceramide from less complex molecules.  Third, in the "salvage" pathway, sphingolipids that are broken down into sphingosine are reused by reacylation to form ceramide.Hydrolysis of sphingomyelin is catalyzed by the enzyme sphingomyelinase. Because sphingomyelin is one of the four common phospholipids found in the plasma membrane of cells, the implications of this method of generating ceramide is that the cellular membrane is the target of extracellular signals leading to programmed cell death.  There has been research suggesting that when ionizing radiation causes apoptosis in some cells, the radiation leads to the activation of sphingomyelinase in the cell membrane and ultimately, to ceramide generation.[2]De novo synthesis of ceramide begins with the condensation of palmitate and serine to form 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme serine palmitoyl transferase and is the rate-limiting step of the pathway. In turn, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to dihydrosphingosine, which is then followed by acylation by the enzyme (dihydro)ceramide synthase to produce dihydroceramide. The final reaction to produce ceramide is catalyzed by dihydroceramide desaturase.  De novo synthesis of ceramide occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ceramide is subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus by either vesicular trafficking or the ceramide transfer protein CERT. Once in the Golgi apparatus, ceramide can be further metabolized to other sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and the complex glycosphingolipids.[3]Constitutive degradation of sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids takes place in the acidic subcellular compartments, the late endosomes and the lysosomes, with the end goal of producing sphingosine. In the case of glycosphingolipids, exohydrolases acting at acidic pH optima cause the stepwise release of monosaccharide units from the end of the oligosaccharide chains, leaving just the sphingosine portion of the molecule, which may then contribute to the generation of ceramides. Ceramide can be further hydrolyzed by acid ceramidase to form sphingosine and a free fatty acid, both of which are able to leave the lysosome, unlike ceramide. The long-chain sphingoid bases released from the lysosome may then re-enter pathways for synthesis of ceramide and/or sphingosine-1-phosphate. The salvage pathway re-utilizes long-chain sphingoid bases to form ceramide through the action of ceramide synthase. Thus, ceramide synthase family members probably trap free sphingosine released from the lysosome at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum or in endoplasmic reticulum-associated membranes. The salvage pathway has been estimated to contribute from 50% to 90% of sphingolipid biosynthesis.[4]As a bioactive lipid, ceramide has been implicated in a variety of physiological functions including apoptosis, cell growth arrest, differentiation, cell senescence, cell migration and adhesion.[3] Roles for ceramide and its downstream metabolites have also been suggested in a number of pathological states including cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, microbial pathogenesis, obesity, and inflammation.[5][6]Ceramides induce skeletal muscle insulin resistance when synthesized as a result of saturated fat activation of TLR4 receptors.[7] Unsaturated fat does not have this effect.[7] Ceramides induce insulin resistance in many tissues by inhibition of Akt/PKB signaling.[8] Aggregation of LDL cholesterol by ceramide causes LDL retention in arterial walls, leading to atherosclerosis.[9] Ceramides cause endothelial dysfunction by activating protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A).[10] In mitochondria, ceramide suppresses the electron transport chain and induces production of reactive oxygen species.[11]One of the most studied roles of ceramide pertains to its function as a proapoptotic molecule. Apoptosis, or Type I programmed cell death, is essential for the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and is an important physiological response to many forms of cellular stress. Ceramide accumulation has been found following treatment of cells with a number of apoptotic agents, including ionizing radiation,[2][12] UV light,[13] TNF-alpha,[14] and chemotherapeutic agents. This suggests a role for ceramide in the biological responses of all these agents. Because of its apoptosis-inducing effects in cancer cells, ceramide has been termed the "tumor suppressor lipid".  Several studies have attempted to define further the specific role of ceramide in the events of cell death and some evidence suggests ceramide functions upstream of the mitochondria in inducing apoptosis. However, owing to the conflicting and variable nature of studies into the role of ceramide in apoptosis, the mechanism by which this lipid regulates apoptosis remains elusive.[15]The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis.[16][17][18] It is composed of terminally differentiated and enucleated corneocytes that reside within a lipid matrix, like "bricks and mortar." Together with cholesterol and free fatty acids, ceramides form the lipid mortar, a water-impermeable barrier that prevents evaporative water loss. As a general rule of thumb, the epidermal lipid matrix is composed of an equimolar mixture of ceramides (~50% by weight), cholesterol (~ 25% by weight), and free fatty acids (~15% by weight), with smaller quantities of other lipids also being present.[19][20]  The lipid barrier also protects against the entry of microorganisms.[18]Epidermal ceramides have a diversity of structures and can be broadly classified as AS and NS ceramides, ADS and NDS dihydroceramides,  AH, EOH, and NH 6-hydroxyceramides, AP and NP phytoceramides, and EOH and EOS acylceramides, see figure.[16] The diversity of ceramide structures undoubtedly plays an important role in the unique attributes of the stratum corneum across different body sites. For example, the stratum corneum of the face is thin and flexible to accommodate different facial expressions. In contrast, the stratum corneum covering the heel of the foot is thick and rigid to protect against trauma. Matching these structural changes, there are body-site specific alterations in the epidermal lipidome, including changes in the relative abundance of the different epidermal ceramide structures.[16]Similar to body site-specific alterations in ceramide abundance, there are also well-characterized changes in epidermal ceramide expression in patients with inflammatory skin diseases. In the hyperplastic disorder psoriasis, investigators have reported an increase in AS and NS ceramides and a decrease in EOS, AP, and NP ceramides, which may contribute to a defect in the skin's water impermeability barrier.[21][22][20] Studying ceramide expression in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis patients, other investigators have reported that rather than focusing on ceramide classes, ceramide sphingoid base length and fatty acid chain length have the strongest influence on the likelihood of a particular ceramide structure being upregulated or downregulated in inflamed skin.[16]Inhibition of ceramide synthesis with myriocin in obese mice may lead to both improved leptin signaling and decreased insulin resistance by decreasing SOCS-3 expression.[23] An elevated level of ceramide can cause insulin resistance by inhibiting the ability of insulin to activate the insulin signal transduction pathway and/or via the activation of JNK.[24]Currently, the means by which ceramide acts as a signaling molecule are not clear.One hypothesis is that ceramide generated in the plasma membrane enhances membrane rigidity and stabilizes smaller lipid platforms known as lipid rafts, allowing them to serve as platforms for signalling molecules. Moreover, as rafts on one leaflet of the membrane can induce localized changes in the other leaflet of the bilayer, they can potentially serve as the link between signals from outside the cell to signals to be generated within the cell.Ceramide has also been shown to form organized large channels traversing the mitochondrial outer membrane. This leads to the egress of proteins from the intermembrane space.[30][31][32]Ceramides may be found as ingredients of some topical skin medications used to complement treatment for skin conditions such as eczema.[33]   They are also used in cosmetic products such as some soaps, shampoos, skin creams, and sunscreens.[34] Additionally, ceramides are being explored as a potential therapeutic in treating cancer.[35]Ceramide is rarely found in bacteria.[36] Bacteria of family Sphingomonadaceae, however, contain it.Ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) is a sphingolipid consisted of a ceramide and a phosphoethanolamine head group. CPE is the major sphingolipid class in some invertebrates such as members of Drosophila. In contrast, mammalian cells contain only small amounts of CPE."

Hanan Eshel;"Hanan Eshel (Born at Rehovot on July 25, 1958,[1] died April 8, 2010) was an Israeli archaeologist and historian, well known in the field of Dead Sea Scrolls studies, although he did research in the Hasmonean and Bar Kokhba periods as well. With Magen Broshi he discovered a number of residential caves in the near vicinity of Qumran and co-published a number of historically significant documents from Qumran.Eshel received his academic training at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, completing his B.A. at the Institute of Archaeology in 1984, his M.A. 1985–1988 and his Ph.D. in 1993, both in the Jewish History Department. His PhD was on the origins of Samaritanism. While working on his PhD he started teaching in the department of Land of Israel Studies and Archeology at Bar-Ilan University. That was in 1990. He would remain at Bar-Ilan for the next twenty years, receiving an appointment as an associate professor in 1999 and serving as head of the department between 2002 and 2004.[2]As an archaeologist Eshel worked in 1986 and 1993 at a number of caves in the Judaean Desert where refugees hid from the Romans during the Bar Kokhba revolt. In one cave near Jericho he found 19 business documents in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. From 1995 to 1999 he co-directed five seasons at Tel Yatir near Arad. Eshel carried out three seasons at Qumran with Magen Broshi in 1996, 2001 and 2002, discovering amongst other things the remains of a series of caves inhabited at the time of use of the Qumran settlement.In 2004 Eshel was shown fragments of ancient Hebrew texts reportedly being offered on the black market. This was apparently an attempt by the holder to estimate the worth of his find. The following year Eshel found that the text had not been sold and so with money from Bar-Ilan University he purchased the material and turned it over to the Israel Antiquities Authority. He believed the fragments, from the book of Leviticus, originated in one of the caves in Nahal Arugot used as refuges from the Romans in the second century.[3]Eshel edited numerous books and published over 200 articles.[1] His complete publications list includes fifteen books and monographs, 230 articles and reviews, and fifteen encyclopedia entries.[4]His articles include:His books include:During his military service (1977–1980), Hanan Eshel met and married his wife, Esther ("Esti") Eshel, an epigraphist, with whom he wrote a number of academic articles.[5] Eshel is survived by his wife, a son, Avshalom, a daughter, Michal, and three grandchildren.[1][6]"

Zhang Baifa;"Zhang Baifa (Chinese: 张百发, 1935 – 5 July 2019) was a Chinese politician and a construction worker by trade. He became a protégé of Wan Li and rose to the position of Vice Mayor and Executive Vice Mayor of Beijing, serving from 1983 to 1995. Zhang was in charge of major construction projects in Beijing, including those in preparation for the 1990 Asian Games, and led the city's unsuccessful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics.Zhang was born in 1935 in Xianghe County, Hebei, Republic of China. In 1948, he moved with his father, a weaver, to Beijing. Owing to poverty, he was unable to attend school and worked as his father's assistant.[1]With the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Beijing regained its status as the capital of China, and the new Communist government initiated a large number of construction projects. In 1951, Zhang became an apprentice rebar worker at the age of 16.[1] He and his friend, carpenter Li Ruihuan, worked together in the construction of the Great Hall of the People and solved a number of technical issues. After work, he took adult education courses at night, and eventually earned a correspondence education degree from the Renmin University of China.[1]Zhang was named a "model worker" of Beijing in 1954,[1] and joined the Communist Party of China in the same year.[2] He was elected a delegate to the 4th National People's Congress,[2] and the Beijing leader Deng Tuo called him a "people's hero".[1]From 1958 to 1966, when Wan Li served as Vice Mayor of Beijing in charge of construction, Li Ruihuan and Zhang Baifa were his key assistants and described in Chinese media as the "Heng and Ha Generals" of Wan.[1][2] However, Wan was purged when the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966, and Zhang was also persecuted as his protégé.[1]After the end of Cultural Revolution, Zhang was rehabilitated and appointed Vice Mayor of Beijing in 1983. He later served as Executive Vice Mayor until his retirement in 1998. During his tenure, he was in charge of major construction projects in Beijing, such as those in preparation for the 1990 Asian Games.[1]Zhang led Beijing's unsuccessful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics.[3] In July 1993, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the International Olympic Committee to reject Beijing's bid because of China's human rights abuses. In reaction, Zhang told Australia's Special Broadcasting Service that China might boycott the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games as revenge.[3] In his interview with the television station, he praised American people but called the US Congress "stupid".[3] He Zhenliang, head of the Chinese Olympic Committee, denied that Zhang's remarks represented official Chinese policy.[3]Because of his humble background and approachable personality, Zhang was praised in Chinese media as a "people's mayor".[1][2] However, scientist Fang Lizhi openly criticized him in 1985 for travelling to the United States as a member of an official scientific delegation for high energy physics.[4][5]Zhang and his wife Wang Shulan (王淑兰) had a son and a daughter. By coincidence, his wife shared the same name and birthdate as the wife of his friend and colleague Li Ruihuan, who rose to the Politburo Standing Committee.[6]Zhang died in Beijing on 5 July 2019, at the age of 84.[1][2]"

Ingrid Kaiserfeld;"Ingrid Kaiserfeld (born 16 January 1961) is an Austrian operatic soprano. She is best known as a Mozart interpreter, especially for her "Queen of the Night" (The Magic Flute), which she sang over 80 times.Born in Pernegg an der Mur, Kaiserfeld completed her studies at the Graz Musikhochschule. Initially active as a concert singer, she switched to the opera stage in Graz after a few years. There, after her debut as "Lisa" (The Land of Smiles), she sang "Nedda" (Pagliacci), "Lucia" (Lucia di Lammermoor) and "Irene" (Belisario), among others. In Graz, she achieved her first career highlights as "Gilda (Rigoletto) and "Donna Anna" (Don Giovanni), which were received with great praise by the press and the public.From 1998 onwards, she was an ensemble member of the Vienna State Opera, where she sang, among others, the "1st Lady" (the Magic Flute), "Musetta" (La Bohème) and "Rosalinde" (Die Fledermaus).[1] Since 2002, she has been a freelance artist. In the 2012/13 academic year, Kaiserfeld took on a singing professorship at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Munich.[2]In 2001, her first "Queen of the Night" (The Magic Flute) took place in Basel. The critic of the NZZ wrote: '... the fairy tale characters suddenly become human beings. This applies... to the Queen of the Night, who fights as much for her daughter as for her power. Ingrid Kaiserfeld has the vocal range for both, lyrical warmth and coloratura brilliance." She subsequently sang this role also in Frankfurt, at the Mozart Festival La Coruna (May 2003), at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, in Toulouse and the Vienna State Opera, in Lyon and Opera Bastille (both in 2004) and finally in 2005 in a new production under Claudio Abbado in Italy and Germany (Festspielhaus Baden-Baden) and at the Teatro Regio di Torino (2006). This brought Kaiserfeld the attention she needed to establish herself primarily as a Mozart interpreter. This was followed by roles such as "Donna Anna" (Don Giovanni) at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival under Louis Langree and in the Konwitschny production at the Komische Oper Berlin. Quote: "Ingrid Kaiserfeld as 'Donna Anna', a coloratura soprano full of radiant beauty ...a delight to listen to.".[3] This was followed by "Fauno" (Ascanio in Alba) in Bologna in 2005 and "Vitellia" (La clemenza di Tito) in Caen in 2006, "Konstanze" in (Die Entführung aus dem Serail) at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino under Zubin Mehta, at the Mozart Festival La Coruna under Jesús López Cobos, at the Frankfurt Opera under J.

Killa Saifullah District;"Kila Saifullah District, Qilla Saifullah, or Saifullah Killa (Urdu and Balochi: قلعہ سیف اللہ, Pashto: قلعه سیف الله) is a district in northwestern Balochistan province, Pakistan. It was established as a district in  1988 comprising two former administrative units of Zhob District: the Upper Zhob sub-division and the sub-tehsil of Badinai, previously named Kashatoo and part of the subdistrict of Kakar Khurasan.[2]Early in the 13th century the country came within the sphere of the raids organised by Genghis Khan, the Mongol. In 1398 AD, an expedition against the Afghans of the area was led by Pir Muhammad, grandson of Amir Timur. Although no authentic information exist about any foreign occupation, many forts, mounds and karezes are attributed to the Mughals. Both Nadir Shah (reigned 1736–47) and Ahmed Shah (reigned 1747–73) extended their power through Balochistan and thenceforth Zhob remained under the more or less nominal suzerainty of the Durranis and Barakzais until it came under British protection. In the middle of the 18th century Ahmed Shah granted a sanad (certificate) to Bekar Nika, fourth in descent from Jogi and the head of the Jogezai family, conferring upon him the title and position of "Badshah or Ruler of Zhob". Shah Jehan Jogezai was conferred as Badshah of Zhob. The descendants of Shah Jehan Jogezai used to live in Loralai District of Balochistan.The British sent its Zhob Expedition in 1884 in order to occupy the Zhob region through Baratkhail. Meanwhile, the castles of Saifullah Khan Khoidadzai and Shah Jehan Jogezai (Badshah of Zhob) were demolished. On 7 October 1884, an assault on the Qalla (castle) of Shah Jehan near Akhterzai resulted the killings of many tribal people including Malik Hamza Daulatzai and Mohammad Ghous who fought bravely. All 500 tribal Sardars admitted their submission before the British forces and also signed an agreement that they will not interfere in the affairs of British Government in Zhob region except Saifullah Khan Khoidadzai and Shah Jehan Jogezai who had a narrow escape from the battle scene and established themselves at Kalat, where they used to operate their insurgency campaign against the British and never subdued before the British occupying forces.[3]At the time of the 2017 census the district had a population of 342,932, of which 181,806 were males and 161,121 females. Rural population was 279,639 (81.54%) while the urban population was 63,293 (18.46%). The literacy rate was 32.77% - the male literacy rate was 43.22% while the female literacy rate was 21.00%. 432 people in the district were from religious minorities.The district is administratively subdivided into the following tehsils:[4]At present the district is divided into two sub-divisions: Qilla Saifullah and Muslim Bagh. Kila Saifullah sub-division comprises one tehsil (Killa Saifullah) and one sub-tehsil (Badinai). Killa Saifullah tehsil is further sub-divided into two Qanungo circles and then into five patwar circles. The entire Badinai sub-tehsil is a Qanungo circle as well as patwar circle. Muslim Bagh sub-division comprises Muslim Bagh tehsil and Loiband sub-tehsil. The entire Muslim Bagh tehsil is one Qanungo circle, further sub-divided into four patwar circles. The Loiband sub-tehsil consists of one qanungo circle and is sub-divided into two patwar circles.According to the Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017, district Killa Saifullah is ranked at number 127 out of the 141 ranked districts in Pakistan on the education score index. This index considers learning, gender parity and retention in the district.Literacy rate in 2014–15 of population 10 years and older in the district stands at 40% whereas for females it is only 6%.[5]Post primary access is a major issue in the district with 88% schools being at primary level. Compare this with high schools which constitute only 4% of government schools in the district. This is also reflected in the enrolment figures for 2016–17 with 15,836 students enrolled in class 1 to 5 and only 338 students enrolled in class 9 and 10.Gender disparity is another issue in the district. Only 24% schools in the district are girls’ schools. Access to education for girls is a major issue in the district and is also reflected in the low literacy rates for females.Moreover, the schools in the district lack basic facilities. According to Alif Ailaan district education rankings 2017, the district is ranked at number 140 out of the 155 districts of Pakistan for primary school infrastructure. At the middle school level, it is ranked at number 134 out of the 155 districts. These rankings take into account the basic facilities available in schools including drinking water, working toilet, availability of electricity, existence of a boundary wall and general building condition. Approximately 3 out of 4 schools do not have electricity in them. 2 out 3 schools lack a toilet and 1 out of 2 schools do not have a boundary wall. 2 out of 5 schools do not have clean drinking water.The main issue[6] for the district is the poor infrastructure of schools. They are reported to be in poor condition and need immediate repair.The district is rich with mineral wealth and produces high quality chromite in Pakistan, the second largest reserve in the world. Gypsum, ores of coal, salt, granite, marble, copper and gabbro are also found in various parts of the district. Being rich in oil and gas, the government of Pakistan has started oil and gas exploration in the Murgha Fairzai, Shaighala and Kakar Khurasan areas.[citation needed]Killa Saifullah is about 182 km south of the provincial capital Quetta.

Immoral Tales (film);"Immoral Tales (French: Contes immoraux) is a 1973 French anthology film directed by Walerian Borowczyk. The film was Borowczyk's most sexually explicit at the time.[1] The film is split into four erotic-themed stories that involve the loss of virginity, masturbation, bloodlust, and incest.[1]After the release of Immoral Tales, Borowczyk began to fall out of favor with film critics. Modern critical reception to the film is that it is not one of Borowczyk's strongest works.The film is separated into four stories:By 1972, Walerian Borowczyk was known predominantly for his various short films which were made to support feature-length releases.[3] Borowczyk's feature films had made very little income from their theatrical releases while short films were not in demand as much as supporting features in cinemas.[3] At this time, Borowczyk met with producer Anatole Dauman, who suggested that because France's film censors had relaxed the laws concerning censorship, Borowczyk should make an erotic feature to gain an audience.[3]The film's stories are taken from various sources, including surrealist writers and poets. The first story in the film is taken from surrealist writer André Pieyre de Mandiargues. The title of the second story is taken from an anonymous sacrilegious novel from the 18th century. The third story is a re-telling of the case of Elizabeth Báthory from the study of surrealist poet Valentine Penrose.[4]A fifth story in the Immoral Tales was originally planned, but was taken out of the film and developed into the feature film La Bête (1975).[4]30 gallons of real blood (from pigs) were used for the Countess Bathory's bath.[5]Immoral Tales was screened in Britain in September 1973 as an incomplete work.[6] This version included the short film A Private Collection, The Tide and The Beast of Gévaudan.[6]Immoral Tales was released in French theaters in 1974.[3] The French film magazine Le Film français stated in 1974, 128 films that were classified as "erotic" were screened in Paris.[7] This accounted for 16% of the total French box office.[8] Immoral Tales sold 359,748 tickets, making it the second most popular release of these films, the most popular being Emmanuelle.[9]It was shown at the 17th Regus London Film Festival held in November and December 1973.[10] The film won the London Festival Choice award at the festival.[10]Immoral Tales was shown at the 12th Kinoteka Polish Film Festival in London in May 2014.[11]In 1974, Immoral Tales won the Prix de L'Âge d'or, an award intended to commemorate the spirit of surrealism.[3] After the release of Immoral Tales, Borowczyk began to fall out of favor with film critics.[12] New York Magazine wrote an unfavourable review, referring to the film as "episodic and disjointed, but also written with a great deal of stupidity" and describing the story-telling, directing, acting and photography in the film as "wretched."[13]Among modern reviews, AllMovie gave the film three stars out of five, feeling that first two stories did not work as well as the second two as well as saying that it was Borowczyk's move from "art house material and toward softcore, as such, the material displays its director's characteristic intelligence but lapses into exploitation a little too often."[14] In an overview of Borowczyk's work in the film magazine Senses of Cinema, Immoral Tales is referred to as his weakest amongst his first five feature films and that "an unsensational approach to the material and detached gaze of the camera make it closer to a surrealist text than a pornographic movie."[1] Dave Kehr wrote a review for the Chicago Reader praising that the film "contains some very elegant images" but compared it negatively to Borowczyk's followup The Story of Sin, which Kehr proclaimed "avoided the trap of superficiality by adopting an ironic mode. Here, he seems entirely too sincere—and more than a little dull."[15]In his 2014 review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw praises the film, citing the influence of Ken Russell and Pier Paolo Pasolini.[16]"
Josef Wüst;"Josef Wüst (March 11, 1925 – February 19, 2003) was an Austrian journalist, editor-in-chief and publisher.Josef Wüst was born in Velika Greda, Podunavlje Oblast, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, the third child of the Wüst family, and spent his early life together with his siblings Franz and Elisabeth on their parents' farm.[1][2] He was in secondary school in the nearby town of Vršac during World War II when the Balkan Campaign began in 1941 in the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and the language of education changed from Serbian to German.[1]In fall 1944 Germans had to flee from the Banat, Josef's father was killed and the family were dispossessed of all their belongings. His brother joined combat units, while his mother and sister were interned in Serbian camps. Josef managed to escape with his school class by way of Budapest and Vienna to Sankt Pölten,[1] where he graduated from the teacher training college.[2] Continuing his journey, he became caught between the closing East and West fronts in the Czechoslovak Republic. After barely surviving, he tried to return to his hometown on foot. Being arrested and freed several times, he successfully crossed the Alps and reached Carinthia. There he was taken into the custody of the British army and was informed of the fate of his hometown. After his release he became an elementary school teacher in Carinthia. Meanwhile, his mother and sister had arrived in Vienna and were able to make contact with him through the refugee relief program of the Austrian Caritas organization.[2]To reunite with them, in November 1945 Wüst moved to Vienna, where he made a living as a shoemaker. He enrolled in the faculty of philosophy at the University of Vienna on October 6, 1948. On September 26, 1950, he changed his focus of study to journalism. During his studies he spent six months in Madrid on a scholarship, but returning from Spain to Vienna, he only had enough money to reach Salzburg. Fortunately he found work with the US army there. During his time in Salzburg he also joined the Catholic fraternity K.Ö.H.V. Rheno-Juvavia Salzburg. Once back in Vienna he joined the affiliated K.Ö.H.V. Saxo-Bavaria Prag, and on December 22, 1954, he graduated from the university. His doctoral dissertation is on the beginning of letterpress in the Banat.[2]After graduation Wüst worked as a freelancer at a publishing house, the Österreichischer Wirtschaftsverlag (Austrian business press) and as a courier.[2] In 1958 his position at the publisher became permanent, he worked there as a journalist and editor-in-chief until 1985, during which time he supervised its journals for the sporting goods, joiner, master carpenter, electronics, butcher and automobile branches.[3][4][5]Josef Wüst became an Austrian citizen on February 5, 1951. On July 13, 1957, he married Helga Hoch, they had four children.[2] He died on February 19, 2003, in Lintsching, in the Lungau.[3][4]In 1991 Wüst published Verlorene Heimat Georgshausen, describing life in a small village of Danube Swabians in Banat from 1849 to 1945.[1][6] An English translation, Lost Homeland Georgshausen, was published in March 2008.[7]The newspaper Unser Dorftrommler (December 1991[8] – November 2002[9]) focused on informing former citizens of Georgshausen and their descendants about the past village life, as well as distributing recent news.[10]At the end of the last century Wüst created together with the councilmen of the three villages Georgshausen, Setschanfeld and Altlez the website www.drei-doerfer-im-banat.de. In 2020 the website was revised and moved to www.georgshausen.com.[11]"

Masovian Voivodeship;"The Masovian Voivodeship, also known as the Mazovia Province[4] (Polish: województwo mazowieckie [vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ mazɔˈvʲɛtskʲɛ]) is a voivodeship (province) in east-central Poland, with its capital located in the city of Warsaw, that also serves as the capital of the country. It has an area of 35,579 square kilometres (13,737 sq mi), and in 2019, it had the population of 5,411,446, making it the biggest and the most populated voivodeship of Poland.[1] Its principal cities are Warsaw (1.783 million) in the centre of the Warsaw metropolitan area, Radom (212,230) in the south, Płock (119,709) in the west, Siedlce (77,990) in the east, and Ostrołęka (52,071) in the north.The province was created on 1 January 1999, out of the former voivodeships of Warsaw, Płock, Ciechanów, Ostrołęka, Siedlce and Radom, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. The province's name recalls the traditional name of the region, Mazovia, with which it is roughly coterminous. However, southern part of the voivodeship, with Radom, historically belongs to Lesser Poland, while Łomża and its surroundings, even though historically part of Mazovia, now is part of Podlaskie Voivodeship.It is bordered by six other voivodeships: Warmian-Masurian to the north, Podlaskie to the north-east, Lublin to the south-east, Świętokrzyskie to the south, Łódź to the south-west, and Kuyavian-Pomeranian to the north-west.Mazovian Voivodeship is the centre of science, research, education, industry and infrastructure in the country.[5] It currently has the lowest unemployment rate in Poland and is classified as a very high income province.[5] Moreover, it is popular among holidaymakers due to the number of historical monuments and greenery, forests cover over 20% of the voivodeship's area, where pines and oaks predominate in the regional landscape.[6] Additionally, the Kampinos National Park located within Masovia is a UNESCO-designated biosphere reserve.Masovian Voivodeship is divided into 42 counties, including 5 city counties and 37 land counties. These are subdivided into 314 gminas (municipilaties), which include 85 urban gminas.The voivodeship contains 10 cities and 78 towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures for 2019):[1]Towns:The Masovian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Masovia is Konstanty Radziwiłł.The Sejmik of Masovia consists of 51 members.Protected areas in Masovian Voivodeship include one National Park and nine Landscape Parks. These are listed below.Masovia Voivodeship, 1526–1795 (Polish: Województwo Mazowieckie) was an administrative region of the Kingdom of Poland, and of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, from the 15th century until the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Together with Płock and Rawa Voivodeships, it formed the province (prowincja) of Masovia.Masovian Voivodeship was one of the voivodeships of Congress Poland. It was formed from Warsaw Department, and transformed into Masovia Governorate.There are three main road routes that pass through the voivodeship: Cork–Berlin–Poznań–Warszawa–Minsk–Moscow–Omsk, Prague–Wrocław–Warsaw–Białystok–Helsinki and Pskov–Gdańsk–Warsaw–Kraków–Budapest.Currently, there are various stretches of autostrada in the area, with the A2 autostrada connecting the region, and therefore the capital city, with the rest of Europe. The autostrada passes directly through the voivodship from west to east, connecting it with Belarus and Germany. However, the A2 is yet to be built east of Warsaw to connect Poland with Belarus. The S8 expressway connects Warsaw with Białystok in the neighboring eastern province, along with the S17 being built to connect Warsaw with Lublin.The railroad system is based on Koleje Mazowieckie and PKP Intercity.The main international airport in the region is Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport.Masovian Voivodeship is the wealthiest province in Poland. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was €112.2 billion in 2018, accounting for 22.6% of the Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €34,400 or 114% of the EU27 average in the same year.[14]The unemployment rate stood at 4.8% in 2017 and was higher than the national and the European average.[15]Płock Cathedral, burial site of Polish monarchsWarsaw Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage SiteLiw CastleSaint Catherine of Alexandria church in RadomPalace in Otwock WielkiSzydłowiec Town HallWilanów Palace in WarsawŁyszkiewicz Apartment in Warsaw, birthplace of Marie Curie, presently a museum of the Nobel Prize winnerBirthplace of Frédéric Chopin in Żelazowa Wola, presently a museum of the composerModlin Fortress"
Anawrahta of Launggyet;"Anawrahta Minsaw (Burmese: အနော်ရထာ မင်းစော, pronounced [ʔənɔ̀jətʰà mɪ́ɴ sɔ́], d. March 1408) was king of Launggyet Arakan from 1406 to 1408. He was appointed to the position by his overlord King Minkhaung I of the Ava Kingdom. He later married Minkhaung's eldest daughter Saw Pyei Chantha. He was overthrown in 1408 by the Hanthawaddy Kingdom army, and subsequently executed on the order of King Razadarit of Hanthawaddy. He is one of two historical personalities that make up the Shwe Nawrahta nat spirit in the Burmese pantheon of nats.Prior to his appointment as King of Arakan, he was known as Gamani,[1] the governor of Kalay, a vassal Shan state of Ava.[2] His rule at Kalay apparently was short.[note 1] Circa December 1406, his overlord King Minkhaung I appointed him to be king of Arakan, which Ava forces led by Prince Minye Kyawswa had just conquered.[note 2] Now known by his royal style of Anawrahta Minsaw, he was the third Ava-appointed king of Arakan.[note 3]According to the Arakanese chronicle Rakhine Razawin Thit, Anawrahta's regime brutally suppressed dissent, and never gained popular support.[3] His overlord seemed oblivious. About a year later, Minkhaung sent his eldest daughter Saw Pyei Chantha to the Arakanese capital Launggyet to be Anawrahta's chief queen.[2]But their rule was soon to be challenged. By January 1408,[note 4] King Razadarit of Hanthawaddy had decided to intervene. Pegu had been concerned about Ava's acquisitions (1404–1406) that had swallowed up nearer Shan states and Arakan. With the majority of Ava troops campaigning in the north in early 1408, Razadarit decided it was time.[1] He sent in an invasion force to place either the former king of Arakan Min Saw Mon or Prince Min Khayi on the throne.[note 5] The invasion force consisted of just 4000[4] to 5000 troops[3] but they were greeted as liberators by the populace, and quickly advanced to the capital Launggyet.[3][5] Anawrahta and his Ava coterie put up a fight but were quickly defeated. He tried to flee but was arrested.[3][5] It was March 1408.[note 6]Anawrahta, Saw Pyei Chantha and 3000 prisoners of war (probably including the garrison's families) were deported to Bassein (Pathein) in the Irrawaddy delta. On arrival there, he was promptly executed while his young wife became a queen of Razadarit.[6]Anawrahta is one of the two historical Nawrahtas who came to form the Shwe Nawrahta nat in the Burmese pantheon of nat spirits.[7]"

Responsibility for the September 11 attacks;"At around 9:30 pm on September 11, 2001, George Tenet, director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) told President George W. Bush and U.S. senior officials that the CIA's Counterterrorism Center had determined that Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda were responsible for the September 11 attacks.[1] Two weeks after 9/11, the Federal Bureau of Investigation connected the hijackers to al-Qaeda,[2] a militant Salafist Islamist multi-national organization. In a number of video, audio, interview and printed statements, senior members of al-Qaeda have also asserted responsibility for organizing the September 11 attacks.[3][4][5]The FBI investigation into the attacks, codenamed operation PENTTBOM, was able to identify the 19 hijackers within days, as they made little effort to conceal their names on flight, credit card, and other records.[6] By checking flight manifests and comparing them with other information, like watch lists, customs officials were able to find the names of all 19 hijackers quickly.Passengers and crew aboard the flights provided information about the hijackers while the hijacking was in progress. Two flight attendants on American Airlines Flight 11, Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney, contacted airline personnel on the ground.  Sweeney provided the seat numbers of the hijackers, and descriptions of the men, identifying Mohamed Atta as one of the hijackers.[7][8][9] A flight attendant on United Airlines Flight 175 called a United Airlines mechanic and reported that hijackers had killed the crew.[9] While the hijacking was in progress on American Airlines Flight 77, several passengers, including a flight attendant, Renee May, contacted and reported details of the hijacking to persons on the ground.[10] Sales clerks identified two individuals to whom they sold tickets on Flight 77 as the hijackers Hani Hanjour and Majed Moqed.[9] During the hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93, Jeremy Glick identified the hijackers as Arabic-looking and carrying box-cutters.[11]Mohamed Atta's luggage did not make the connection from his Portland flight to American Airlines Flight 11.  In his suitcase, authorities found a handwritten letter in Arabic.  As well, a handwritten letter was found at the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and another in Hazmi's vehicle.[12] When examining Mohamed Atta's left-behind luggage, the FBI found important clues about the hijackers and their plans. Atta's luggage contained instructional videotapes for flying large aircraft, a fuel consumption calculator, and a flight plan, along with a copy of the Quran.[13] His luggage also contained papers that revealed the identity of all 19 hijackers, along with a copy of Atta's last will and testament.[14] The passport of hijacker Abdulaziz Alomari was also found in Mohamed Atta's left-behind luggage.Various items of evidence were found in vehicles left behind at the airports, in luggage that did not make it onto the flights, and at the crash scenes. A rental car belonging to the hijackers was found at Boston's Logan International Airport, which contained an Arabic language flight manual and documents from Huffman Aviation in Florida.  There, investigators were able to find Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi's previous address in Hamburg, Germany.[15] Nawaf al-Hazmi's 1988 blue Toyota Corolla was found on September 12 in Dulles International Airport's hourly parking lot.  Inside the vehicle, authorities found a letter written by Mohamed Atta, maps of Washington, D.C., and New York City, a cashier's check made out to a Phoenix flight school, four drawings of a Boeing 757 cockpit, a box cutter-type knife, and a page with notes and phone numbers.[16]In New York City, a passport belonging to Satam al-Suqami was found by a passerby before the towers collapsed, and given to a NYPD detective.[17][18] The passports of two of the hijackers of Flight 93 were also found intact at the crash site.On September 27, 2001, the FBI released photos of the 19 hijackers, along with information about the possible nationalities and aliases of many.[19]For several months after the 9/11 attacks, no one, nor any group, claimed responsibility for the attacks, so the primary responsibility fell solely upon the hijackers, all of whom were killed and all of whom left no message or any claim of responsibility, explaining why they had carried out the attacks. As the media covered the 9/11 attacks unfolding, many quickly speculated that bin Laden was behind the attacks.[20] On the day of the attacks, the National Security Agency intercepted communications that pointed to bin Laden,[21] as did German intelligence agencies.[22] This helped rule out other immediate suspects, such as Croatian nationalists, who had planted a bomb in Grand Central Terminal on September 10, 1976.[23]Authorities in the United States and Britain also obtained electronic intercepts, including telephone conversations and electronic bank transfers, which indicate that Mohammed Atef, a bin Laden deputy, was a key figure in the planning of the 9/11 attacks. Intercepts were also obtained that revealed conversations that took place days before September 11 between bin Laden and an associate in Pakistan.  In those conversations, the two referred to "an incident that would take place in America on, or around, September 11" and they discussed potential repercussions. In another conversation with an associate in Afghanistan, bin Laden discussed the "scale and effects of a forthcoming operation." These conversations did not specifically mention the World Trade Center or Pentagon, or other specifics.[24]The investigators were quickly able to link the 19 men to the terrorist organization al-Qaeda, also by accessing material in their intelligence agency files.  The New York Times reported on September 12 that: "Authorities said they had also identified accomplices in several cities who had helped plan and execute Tuesday's attacks. Officials said they knew who these people were and important biographical details about many of them. They prepared biographies of each identified member of the hijack teams, and began tracing the recent movements of the men."  FBI agents in Florida investigating the hijackers quickly "descended on flight schools, neighborhoods and restaurants in pursuit of leads." At one flight school, "students said investigators were there within hours of Tuesday's attacks."[25] The Washington Post later reported that "In the hours after Tuesday's bombings, investigators searched their files on [Satam] al-Suqami and [Ahmed] al-Ghamdi, noted the pair's ties to [Nabil] al-Marabh and launched a hunt for him."[26]Based on the evidence, authorities in the United States quickly asserted that Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda organization were solely responsible for the attacks, and other suspects were ruled out.  The Government of the United Kingdom reached the same conclusion.[27] Although he denied involvement in the attacks at first, Osama bin Laden claimed full responsibility in a 2004 video.Author Laurie Mylroie, writing in the conservative political magazine The American Spectator in 2006, argued that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his family are the primary architects of 9/11 and similar attacks, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's association with Osama bin Laden is secondary, and that Al-Qaeda's claim of responsibility for the attack is after the fact and opportunistic.[28] In an opposing point of view, former CIA officer Robert Baer, writing in Time magazine in 2007, asserted that George W. Bush Administration's publicizing of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's claims of responsibility for 9/11 and numerous other acts was a mendacious attempt to claim that all of the significant actors in 9/11 had been caught.[29]Intelligence experts speak of a "short list" of prime suspects—groups that possess both the means and the motive to carry out the crime. Two of the passengers had been identified as al-Qaeda members and were on the FBI's terrorist-alert list prior to 9/11: Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi[2][3]. It appears certain that all hijackers had Arab origins, and none were Afghan, moreover, both in their immense scale, careful planning and refraining from claiming responsibility, the attacks are reminiscent of al-Qaeda's previous attacks such as the 1998 US embassy bombings that killed over 200 people.In the World Trade Center bombing (February 26, 1993) a car bomb was detonated by Arab Islamist terrorists in the underground parking garage below Tower One of the World Trade Center in New York City.  The 1,500 lb (680 kg) urea nitrate-fuel oil device[30][31] killed six and injured over a thousand people.[31] It was intended to devastate the foundation of the North Tower, causing it to collapse onto its twin.[30]The attack was planned by a group of conspirators including Ramzi Yousef,[32][33] Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, El Sayyid Nosair, Mahmud Abouhalima, Mohammad Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Ahmad Ajaj, and Abdul Rahman Yasin.[34] They received financing from al-Qaeda member Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Yousef's uncle, who would later allegedly admit to planning the September 11 attacks.[35]Starting in 1996, Osama bin Laden stated in public proclamations (fatwas) and in interviews with journalists his common list of grievances which he cited as the reason for his declaration of war against the United States.In 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri (a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad) co-signed a fatwa (binding religious edict) in the name of the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, declaring:[t]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies civilians and military – is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) and the holy mosque (in Makka) from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, "and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together," and "fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah".[36][37]In an interview with journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai published in TIME Magazine on January 11, 1999, Osama bin Laden was quoted as saying:The International Islamic Front for Jihad against the US and Israel has issued a crystal-clear fatwa calling on the Islamic nation to carry on jihad aimed at liberating holy sites. The nation of Muhammad has responded to this appeal. If the instigation for jihad against the Jews and the Americans in order to liberate Al-Aksa Mosque and the Holy Ka'aba Islamic shrines in the Middle East is considered a crime, then let history be a witness that I am a criminal.[38]According to interviews by Al-Jazeera[39] as well as United States interrogations of al-Qaeda members Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (captured in 2002 and 2003 respectively), Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the instigator and prime organizer of the attacks. Bin al-Shibh may have been picked as a hijacker but he failed to get into the United States.[40][41]Khalid Mohammed had provided funding to his nephew Ramzi Yousef[42][43] for the World Trade Center bombing in 1993. In addition, he collaborated on Oplan Bojinka which called for ten or more airliners to be bombed in mid-air or hijacked for use as missiles.[44] Planning for Oplan Bojinka began in 1994, and was funded in part by Osama bin Laden, but was thwarted by an accidental fire in 1995.[45][46][47]In mid-1996,[citation needed] Khalid Mohammed presented a new plan to the leadership of al-Qaeda[48] that called for several airplanes on both east and west coasts[41] to be hijacked and flown into targets.According to the bin al-Shibh and Khalid Mohammed, six of the hijackers played active parts in the planning, including the four who became the pilots. The other two were Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.[48] CIA operatives reportedly monitored the movements of these two known militants when they visited the US but did not notify the FBI or gain an inkling of what the hijackers were planning.[49] However, during a 2006 Moussaoui trial cross-examination,[50] FBI agents stated that the bureau was aware, years before the attacks in 2001, that al-Qaeda planned to use planes to destroy important buildings. Philippine Chief Superintendent Avelino Razon had noted such plans during the 1995 investigation of Oplan Bojinka, of which Razon saidI didn't imagine that they would ram a 757 aircraft into the World Trade Center. I thought the suicide mission [would involve] a Cessna light aircraft loaded with several kilos of explosives, like a Japanese Kamikaze World War II pilot diving into a target.[51]The targets ultimately chosen were the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the United States Capitol. Flight 93 was apparently meant to crash into the Capitol. The White House was considered as a target, initially dismissed as being too difficult to locate from the air, it was later included in the plans.[52] In the communications that developed as the scheme took form, the Pentagon's code name was the Faculty of Arts, Capitol Hill was the Faculty of Law, and the World Trade Center was coded as the Faculty of Town Planning.[53]Al-Qaeda's spokesman, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, said in a video sent to al Jazeera and broadcast in October 2001 the following:The Americans should know that the storm of plane attacks will not abate, with God's permission. There are thousands of the Islamic nations' youths who are eager to die just as the Americans are eager to live.[54]Prior to his death on May 2, 2011, the FBI listed bin Laden as one of the "10 Most Wanted" in connection with several incidents including the USS Cole bombing and the 1998 United States embassy bombings in East Africa.  The FBI's "FBI Most Wanted Terrorists" poster does not specifically hang responsibility for 9/11 on bin Laden, instead it only states "Bin Laden is a suspect in other terrorist attacks throughout the world."[55] FBI spokesman Rex Tomb said, however: "There's no mystery here. They could add 9/11 on there, but they have not because they don't need to at this point. ... There is a logic to it", namely, the long-standing practice of only putting criminal charges on the notice.[56] Bin Laden was charged with the 1998 embassy bombings, not 9/11.[57] David N. Kelley, the former U.S. attorney in New York who dealt with terrorism-related cases at the time of bin Laden's indictment for the 1998 bombings, explained that, "It might seem a little strange from the outside, but it makes sense from a legal point of view. If I were in government, I'd be troubled if I were asked to put up a wanted picture where no formal charges had been filed, no matter who it was."[56]Immediately after September 11, 2001, bin Laden praised the attacks,[58] but denied responsibility for them.[59] On September 16, 2001, an Al Jazeera news presenter read a message purportedly signed by Osama bin Laden, in which the following words were stated: "I stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation."[59][60]In an interview with bin Laden, published in the Pakistani newspaper Ummat Karachi on September 28, 2001, he stated: "I have already said that I am not involved in the September 11 attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act."[61] There was reportedly no way to prove the e-mail published in Pakistan came from bin Laden. The Taliban denied he had access to any communications.[62][63]In late October 2001, Al Jazeera journalist Tayseer Allouni conducted an interview with Osama bin Laden which was videotaped. Al-Jazeera refused to broadcast it[64] and terminated its affiliation agreement with CNN[65] due to CNN's broadcasting of the interview on January 31, 2002.[66] In the interview, bin Laden addressed the September 11 attacks, saying:If inciting people to do that is terrorism, and if killing those who kill our sons is terrorism, then let history be witness that we are terrorists ... We will work to continue this battle, God permitting, until victory or until we meet God before that occurs.[67]In November 2001, US forces recovered a videotape from a bombed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan which showed a man purported to be Osama bin Laden talking to Khaled al-Harbi. In the tape, bin Laden talks of planning the attacks. Translations from the tape include the following lines: ... we calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy, who would be killed based on the position of the tower. We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors. I was the most optimistic of them all ... We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event would take place that day. We had finished our work that day and had the radio on ... Muhammad [Atta] from the Egyptian family [meaning the al-Qaeda Egyptian group], was in charge of the group ... The brothers, who conducted the operation, all they knew was that they have a martyrdom operation and we asked each of them to go to America but they didn't know anything about the operation, not even one letter. But they were trained and we did not reveal the operation to them until they are there and just before they boarded the planes.[68]In May 2002, FBI Director Robert Mueller noted that his organization had not uncovered a single piece of paper, "either here in the U.S. or in the treasure trove of information that has turned up in Afghanistan and elsewhere", that mentioned any aspect of the September 11 plot.[69]In late November 2002, a letter attributed to bin Laden and translated by British Islamists surfaced, often called bin Laden's "letter to America". It states the motive behind the September 11 attacks as being: "because you attacked us and continue to attack us" and justifies the selection of a civilian target. Itemizing a list of perceived Western wrongdoings, the letter concludes that "the oppressed have a right to return the aggression" and hinted at further attacks. Also included are a list of demands, advice, and a statement of grievances against the American government and its people.[70]On February 11, 2003, Al Jazeera broadcast an audio tape purportedly from bin Laden.[71]Shortly before the US presidential election in 2004, in a taped statement, bin Laden publicly acknowledged al-Qaeda's involvement in the attacks on the US, and claimed a direct link to the attacks. He said that the attacks were carried out because "we are a free people who do not accept injustice, and we want to regain the freedom of our nation."[72]In an audio message that surfaced on the Internet in May 2006, the speaker, who is alleged to be Osama bin Laden, defends Zacarias Moussaoui, who was undergoing a trial for his participation in the September 11 attacks. The voice in the audio message saysI begin by talking about the honorable brother Zacarias Moussaoui. The truth is that he has no connection whatsoever with the events of September 11th, and I am certain of what I say, because I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers—Allah have mercy upon them—with those raids, and I did not assign brother Zacarias to be with them on that mission.[73]As of 2004[update], several people—including Mohammed, bin al-Shibh, and Mohammed al Qahtani, the 20th hijacker—were being held by the US as illegal combatants, however, the United States had no one on trial for the attacks. In Germany, Mounir El Motassadeq was convicted of over 3000 counts of accessory to murder for helping finance the hijackers but the verdict was put aside and a new trial scheduled.[74] Abdelghani Mzoudi was acquitted in Germany on the same charges.[75]Imam Anwar al-Awlaki has been linked to Al-Qaeda and persons involved in the attacks, though he denied any connections. In 1998 and 1999, he served as vice president for the Charitable Society for Social Welfare (CSSW) in San Diego, founded by Abdul Majeed al-Zindani of Yemen, who has since been placed on many terrorism lists.[76] During a terrorism trial, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Brian Murphy testified that CSSW was a "front organization to funnel money to terrorists," and US federal prosecutors have described it as being used to support Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda.[76][77] The FBI investigated al-Awlaki beginning in June 1999 through March 2000 for possible fundraising for Hamas, links to al-Qaeda, and a visit in early 2000 by a close associate of "the blind sheik" Omar Abdel Rahman (who was in prison for his role in the 1993 World Trade Center attack until his death in 2017).  The FBI's interest was also triggered by the fact that he had been contacted by a possible "procurement agent" for bin Laden, Ziyad Khaleel, who helped purchase a satellite phone to call his Yemen communications hub that was used in planning the attacks.[76][78] But the FBI was unable to unearth sufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution.[76][79][80][81][82][83]While al-Awlaki was an imam in San Diego, witnesses told the FBI he had a close relationship with two of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks (Nawaf Al-Hazmi and Khalid Almihdhar) in 2000, and served as their spiritual advisor.[76][82][84] The 9/11 Commission Report indicated that the hijackers also "reportedly respected [him] as a religious figure."[78] Authorities say the two hijackers regularly attended the mosque he led in San Diego, and al-Awlaki had many closed-door meetings with them, which led investigators to believe al-Awlaki knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance.[82][83] He left San Diego in mid-2000, traveling to "various countries".[78][82][85][86][87]In January 2001, he headed east and served as Imam at the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in the metropolitan Washington, DC, area.[76][78][88] Esam Omeish hired al-Awlaki to be the mosque's imam.[89][90] Fluent in English, known for giving eloquent talks on Islam, and with a mandate to attract young non-Arabic speakers, al-Awlaki "was the magic bullet", according to mosque spokesman Johari Abdul-Malik, "he had everything all in a box."[91]  "He had an allure. He was charming."[92]Shortly after this, his sermons were attended by two of the 9/11 hijackers (Al-Hazmi again, and Hani Hanjour, which the 9/11 Commission Report concluded "may not have been coincidental"), and by Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan.[82][83][87][93] Furthermore, when police raided the Hamburg, Germany, apartment of Ramzi bin al-Shibh (the "20th hijacker") while investigating the 9/11 attacks, his telephone number was found among bin al-Shibh's personal contact information.[76][79][94]  "In my view, he is more than a coincidental figure," said House Intelligence Committee member Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA).[95]Writing on the IslamOnline.net website six days after the 9/11 attacks, he suggested that Israeli intelligence agents might have been responsible for the attacks, and that the FBI "went into the roster of the airplanes and whoever has a Muslim or Arab name became the hijacker by default."[76]On August 31, 2006, al-Awlaki was arrested with a group of five Yemenis by Yemeni authorities.  He claims it was with regard to a "secret police investigation" over "tribal issues", but it has been reported to relate to charges of kidnapping a Shiite teenager for ransom, and involvement in an al-Qaeda plot to kidnap a U.S. military attaché.[82][92][86] Al-Awlaki blames the U.S. for pressuring the Yemeni authorities to arrest him, and says that in approximately September 2007 he was interviewed by FBI agents with regard to the 9/11 attacks and other subjects.  Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen expert, noted that his name was on a list of 100 prisoners whose release was sought by al-Qaida-linked militants in Yemen.[87]Although al-Awlaki was covered as relatively minor figure in the 9/11 attacks, his involvement was noted again in 2009 after the Fort Hood shooting where the suspect had been found to be communicating by e-mail to Awlaki in Yemen, he was later linked to several terror plots and attacks in the US, Canada and UK, including the Northwest Airlines Flight 253 attack by his former student Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.On October 4, 2001, British Prime Minister Tony Blair released information compiled by Western intelligence agencies connecting Osama bin Laden to the Afghanistan's Taliban leadership as well as being the leader of the al-Qaeda organization.[27] The Taliban government gave safe haven to Osama bin Laden in the years leading up to the attack, and his al-Qaeda network may have had a close relationship with the Taliban army and police.[citation needed] On the day of 9/11, the Taliban foreign minister told the Arab television network Al Jazeera: "We denounce this terrorist attack, whoever is behind it."[96]The United States requested the Taliban to shut down all al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, open them to inspection and turn over Osama bin Laden. The Taliban refused all these requests. Instead they offered to extradite Osama bin Laden to an Islamic country, for trial under Islamic law, if the United States presented evidence of his guilt.[97] The Taliban had previously refused to extradite bin Laden to the United States, or prosecute him, after he was indicted by the US federal courts for involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.[98] The Taliban deemed eyewitness testimony and satellite phone call recordings entered in the public record in February 2001 during a trial as insufficient grounds to extradite bin Laden for his involvement in the bombings.[citation needed]Invoking the Bush Doctrine, which stated "We will make no distinction between the terrorists and those who harbor them", the United States and Britain invaded and overthrew the Taliban regime in 2001, using air power, special forces and the Northern Alliance as a land army.On November 29, 2007, a videotape was released that The Central Intelligence Agency says is likely to be from bin Laden. In it the speaker claims sole responsibility for the attacks and specifically denies any prior knowledge of them by The Taliban or the Afghan people.[99]According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the 9/11 plotters spent between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct the attack:al-Qaeda funded the plotters.  KSM [Khalid Sheikh Mohammad] provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live ... The US government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9/11 attacks.  Ultimately the question is of little practical significance.[100]The 9/11 Commission Report concludes: "we have seen no evidence that any foreign government – or foreign government official – supplied any funding."[101] The difficulty in tracking the funding is due to the traditional means of zakat, a Muslim form of charitable giving essential to proper following of the faith[102] and hawala, another ancient system of transferring funds based on trust and connections, including family, clan, and regional affiliations.[103]CNN and other news outlets reported in September and October 2001 that $100,000 was wired from the United Arab Emirates to lead hijacker Mohamed Atta prior to the attacks, by Ahmed Omar Saeed (Syed) Sheikh, a long time Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence asset.[104]The report, which was later confirmed by CNN,[105] stated that "Atta then distributed the funds to conspirators in Florida ... In addition, sources have said Atta sent thousands of dollars – believed to be excess funds from the operation – back to Syed in the United Arab Emirates in the days before September 11.  Syed also is described as a key figure in the funding operation of al-Qaeda"[106]The day after this report was published, the head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, Gen. Mahmood Ahmed, was fired from his position.[104] Indian news outlets reported the FBI was investigating the possibility that Gen. Mahmood Ahmed ordered Saeed Sheikh to send the $100,000 to Atta, while most Western media outlets only reported his connections to the Taliban as the reason for his departure.[104]The Wall Street Journal was one of the few Western news organizations to follow up on the story, citing the Times of India: "US authorities sought [Gen. Mahmood Ahmed's] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 [was] wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh at the insistence of General Mahmood."[107]There have been suggestions that Saudi Arabia has some responsibility, having helped finance al-Qaeda, and allowing the organization to flourish.  There have been claims that pre-9/11 investigations into al-Qaeda were deliberately blocked via high-level interference from Washington, and that this extends to other groups outside al-Qaeda, in particular individuals from Saudi Arabia.  In June 2001, a "high-placed member of a US intelligence agency" told BBC reporter Greg Palast that "after the [2000] elections, the agencies were told to 'back off' investigating the bin Ladens and Saudi royals."[108]In May 2002, former FBI Agent Robert Wright, Jr. delivered a tearful press conference apologizing to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11. He described how his superiors intentionally obstructed his investigation into al-Qaeda financing.[109][110] Agent Wright would later tell ABC's Brian Ross that "September 11th is a direct result of the incompetence of the FBI's International Terrorism Unit," specifically referring to the Bureau's hindering of his investigation into Yasin al-Qadi, who Ross described as a powerful Saudi Arabian businessman with extensive financial ties in Chicago.[111] One month after the attacks, the US government officially identified al-Qadi as one of Osama bin Laden's primary financiers, through his Muwafaq Foundation, and they declared him to be a global terrorist.[112][113] A former FBI Counter Terrorism Agent commented that for someone like al-Qadi to be involved in 9/11 is "of grave concern."[114]In June 2009 lawyers for 9/11 victims' families provided documents to The New York Times. The families of the victims formed an organization called Families United to Bankrupt Terrorism[115] and filed a civil suit in U.S. federal court that sought to hold The Saudi Royal family responsible for supporting Al Qaeda. On June 29, 2009 the United States Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of a lower court decision that held that the Royal Family are immune from suits in U.S. courts due to a 1976 law. According to The Times "The documents provide no smoking gun connecting the royal family to the events of Sept. 11, 2001. And the broader links rely at times on a circumstantial, connect-the-dots approach to tie together Saudi princes, Middle Eastern charities, suspicious transactions and terrorist groups". According to the Royal families lawyer "In looking at all the evidence the families brought together, I have not seen one iota of evidence that Saudi Arabia had anything to do with the 9/11 attacks".In February 2012, former U.S. senators Bob Graham and Bob Kerrey made sworn statements filed in federal court as part of this litigation commenced by the 9/11 victims' families in which the former senators stated that the government of Saudi Arabia might have played a direct role in the 9/11 attacks.[115][116] The two senators had reviewed top secret information concerning the 9/11 attacks when they were in the Senate. "I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia," stated former senator Graham in his sworn court document. According to Graham's sworn statement, unanswered questions remain regarding Saudi-sponsored financial links to Al Qaeda and the role of Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi citizen living in San Diego with ties to two of the 9/11 hijackers and to officials of the government of Saudi Arabia.[116] There remains substantial unreleased documentation related to these issues.[117][118]On February 4, 2015, former al-Qaeda operative Zacarias Mousaoui who is imprisoned for life for his role in 9/11 attacks, told lawyers that members of the Saudi royal family, including former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal Al Saud, supported al-Qaeda to carry out its attacks.[119]According to a May 2017 Foreign Agents Registration Act document, the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia hired Qorvis MSLGROUP for monitoring and campaigning against the news media coverage on JASTA or Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act and the alleged role of the government of Saudi Arabia in the September 11 attacks. Qorvis MSLGROUP filed a Foreign Agents Registration Act document of the contract, stating activities it conducted on behalf of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia. The services included, coordinating with veterans visits to Capitol Hill concerning JASTA, managing grassroots campaign against JASTA and its reporting in news media like CNN, Wall Street Journal, The Hill, etc.[120]Although the wealthy bin Laden family disowned Osama in 1994 after his alleged involvement in terrorism like the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, the events of 9/11 brought to attention connections between the bin Laden family and the Bush family.[121] It has been alleged that Osama was never disowned and that his family were aware of his activities in the years preceding 9/11.  The connections between the bin Laden family and Bush family have led to conspiracy theories that President George Bush was also aware of Osama's activities and deliberately allowed 9/11 to take place.The movie Fahrenheit 9/11 shows some business connections between the Bush family and the bin Laden family. It relates how Salem bin Laden invested heavily in Arbusto Energy, a company run by George W. Bush, through his friend James R. Bath.[122] Several members of the Bush family are investors in the Carlyle Group, a defense contractor and investment fund with numerous interests in the Saudi Arabia and the Middle East and connections to the Saudi Binladen Group, run by former Reagan administration Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci.[123] On September 10, 2001, former President George H. W. Bush and several members of his cabinet had been present at a Carlyle Group business conference with Shafig bin Laden, a half-brother of Osama bin Laden, at the Ritz-Carlton hotel located several miles from the Pentagon. The conference was continuing with the remaining cabinet members and bin Laden's brother at the time of the Pentagon attack.[124][125] George H. W. Bush remained an advisor to the Carlyle Group for two years after the attacks.The New York Times reported that members of the bin Laden family were driven or flown under Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) supervision to a secret assembly point in Texas and then to Washington from where they left the country on a private charter plane when airports reopened three days after the attacks.[126] The 9/11 commission later concluded that "the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals who left the United States on charter flights" and that the exodus was approved by special advisor Richard Clarke after a request by Saudi Arabia who feared for the safety of their nationals. On June 20, 2007, the public interest group Judicial Watch released FBI documents that it says suggested that Osama bin Laden himself may have chartered one of the flights. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton accused the FBI of conducting a "slapdash" investigation of the flights.[127]Author Steve Coll in his 2008 book The bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century writes that most members of the family barely know Osama. Richard Clarke in a column about the book notes that because it was custom at that time for successful Muslim men to have multiple wives this claim rings true. Clarke also theorizes that the FBI did not question the bin Ladens before they were flown out of the US and have not questioned them since because they already had extensive knowledge about them.[128]Immediately after the attacks, rumors began that Iraq could have played a role. The state-run Iraqi media praised the attacks but denied that Iraq was responsible.[citation needed]  In September 2003, President Bush told the press, "we've had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with September the 11th."[129]On June 29, 2005 Robin Hayes, a Republican Congressman from North Carolina and vice chairman of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism at that time, stated "evidence is clear" that "Saddam Hussein and people like him were very much involved in 9/11". Senator John McCain reacting to the Congressman's statement said "I haven't seen compelling evidence of that."[130] The 9/11 Commission Report stated that there is "no credible evidence" that Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq collaborated with the al-Qaeda terrorist network on any attacks on the United States.  In September 2006, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that "there is no evidence that Saddam Hussein had prewar ties to al-Qaeda and one of the terror organization's most notorious members, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi" and that there was no evidence of any Iraqi support of al-Qaeda or foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks.[131]Despite this, a number of 9/11 opinion polls have shown that a significant minority of the American public believe that Saddam was "personally involved". The theory extended from the one advanced by investigative journalist Jayna Davis in her book The Third Terrorist linking Hussein to the Oklahoma City Bombing. It was discussed in a 2002 op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal.[132]The U.S. indictment of bin Laden filed in 1998 stated that al-Qaeda "forged alliances ... with the government of Iran and its associated terrorist group Hezbollah for the purpose of working together against their perceived common enemies."[133] On May 31, 2001, Steven Emerson and Daniel Pipes wrote in The Wall Street Journal that "Officials of the Iranian government helped arrange advanced weapons and explosives training for Al-Qaeda personnel in Lebanon where they learned, for example, how to destroy large buildings."[134]The 9/11 Commission Report stated that 8 to 10 of the hijackers previously passed through Iran and their travel was facilitated by Iranian border guards.[133][135] The report also found "circumstantial evidence that senior Hezbollah operatives were closely tracking the travel of some of these future muscle hijackers into Iran in November 2000."[135] Judge George B. Daniels ruled in a federal district court in Manhattan that Iran bears legal responsibility for providing "material support" to the 9/11 plotters and hijackers in Havlish, et al. v. Osama bin Laden, Iran, et al.[136][137][138][139] Included in Judge Daniels' findings were claims that Iran "used front companies to obtain a Boeing 757-767-777 flight simulator for training the terrorists", Ramzi bin al-Shibh traveled to Iran in January 2001, and an Iranian government memorandum from May 14, 2001 demonstrates Iranian culpability in planning the attacks.[136] Defectors from Iran's intelligence service testified that Iranian officials had "foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks."[140] By contrast, the 9/11 Commission "found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack. At the time of their travel through Iran, the al Qaeda operatives themselves were probably not aware of the specific details of their future operation." In addition, both bin al-Shibh and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed denied "any relationship between the hijackers and Hezbollah" and "any other reason for the hijackers' travel to Iran" besides "taking advantage of the Iranian practice of not stamping Saudi passports."[135]The 9/11 Commission Report concluded that both presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were "not well served" by the FBI and CIA prior to 9/11.[141] It also explained that the military response protocols were unsuited for the nature of the attack, and identified operational failures in the emergency response.Immediately following the attacks, the Bush Administration stated that "nobody in our government at least, and I don't think the prior government, could envisage flying air planes into buildings" (George Bush) and that no-one "could have predicted that they would try to use an airplane as a missile" (Condoleezza Rice).  An Air Force general called the attack "something we had never seen before, something we had never even thought of."  FBI Director Robert Mueller announced "there were no warning signs that I'm aware of."[142]The 9/11 Commission Report stated that "the 9/11 attacks were a shock, but they should not have come as a surprise.  Islamic extremists had given plenty of warnings that they meant to kill Americans indiscriminately and in large numbers."[143] During the spring and summer of 2001, US intelligence agencies received a stream of warnings about an imminent al-Qaeda attack, according to George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence, "the system was blinking red."[144] The warnings varied in their level of detail and specificity, and included warnings from both domestic intelligence operations and warnings from foreign governments and intelligence agencies.[145]In her testimony to the 9/11 Commission, Condoleezza Rice stated that "the threat reporting that we received in the spring and summer of 2001 was not specific as to time nor place nor manner of attack. Almost all the reports focused on al-Qaeda activities outside the United States." On August 6, 2001, the President's Daily Brief was titled Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US. It warned that bin Laden was planning to exploit his operatives' access to the US to mount a terrorist strike: "FBI information ... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country, consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attack."The 9/11 Commission Report outlined the following "opportunities that were not or could not be exploited by the organizations and systems of the time":With regard to the failures of the US air defense system on the morning of the attacks, the Report explains that:Existing protocols on 9/11 were unsuited in every respect for an attack in which hijacked planes were used as weapons.  What ensued was a hurried attempt to improvise a defense by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction.[147]The Report explains that the emergency response was also "necessarily improvised": there were "weaknesses in preparations for disaster, failure to achieve unified incident command, and inadequate communications among responding agencies ... At the Pentagon, [there were] problems of command and control."[148]"
Evenor (Atlantis);"Evenor (Ancient Greek: Εὐήνωρ Euenor means "joy of men") was the autochthonous father of Cleito by Leucippe.In the Critias, a work of the Greek philosopher Plato, a man named Evenor is described as the ancestor of the kings who ruled the legendary island of Atlantis. According to the account given by Plato's character Critias, Evenor was among the original inhabitants of Atlantis born from the earth (autochthons). He lived with his wife Leucippe on a low hill in the centre of the island, about fifty stadia from the sea. The couple had one daughter, Cleito. When the maiden reached marriageable age, her parents died, but the god Poseidon slept with her and she became mother of five pairs of twin sons. Her oldest son, Atlas, became the first king of Atlantis, with the other sons as subordinate governors.[1]This article relating to Greek mythology is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."

Trinity River (Texas);"The Trinity River is a 710-mile (1,140 km)[2] river, the longest with a watershed entirely within the U.S. state of Texas. It rises in extreme northern Texas, a few miles south of the Red River. The headwaters are separated by the high bluffs on the southern side of the Red River.Indigenous peoples call the northern sections Arkikosa and the parts closer to the coast Daycoa.[2] French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle, in 1687, named it Riviere des canoës ("River of Canoes").  In 1690 Spanish explorer Alonso de León named the river "La Santísima Trinidad" ("the Most Holy Trinity"), in the Spanish Catholic practice of memorializing places by religious references.[3]The Trinity River has four branches: the West Fork,[4] the Clear Fork,[5] the Elm Fork,[6] and the East Fork.[7]The West Fork Trinity River has its headwaters in Archer County.  From there it flows southeast, through the man-made reservoirs Lake Bridgeport and Eagle Mountain Lake, and eastward through Lake Worth and the city of Fort Worth.The Clear Fork Trinity River begins north of Weatherford, Texas, and flows southeastward through Lake Weatherford and Benbrook Lake reservoirs. It flows northeastward, where it joins the West Fork near downtown Fort Worth and continues as the West Fork.The Elm Fork Trinity River[8] flows south from near Gainesville through Ray Roberts Lake and east of the city of Denton, eventually through Lewisville Lake.The West Fork and the Elm Fork merge as they enter the city of Dallas.The East Fork Trinity River (on old maps the Bois d'Arc River) begins near McKinney, Texas, and flows through Lavon Lake and then Lake Ray Hubbard before joining the Trinity River just southeast of Dallas.The Trinity flows southeast from Dallas across a fertile floodplain and the pine forests of eastern Texas. This area gained in population during the period of the Republic of Texas, it had not been extensively settled by Mexican residents before that, although many Tejanas have deep roots here. The Trinity crosses Texas State Highway 31 in Henderson County, near where the first county seat, Buffalo, was established. Roughly 65 miles (105 km) north of the mouth on Galveston Bay, an earthen dam was built in 1968 to form Lake Livingston.The river empties into Trinity Bay, an arm of Galveston Bay that is an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico. Its river mouth is near the town of Anahuac, southeast of Houston.Plans from the 1890s for a shipping channel along the length of the Trinity River were scrapped because it would have required extensive dredging to make the river navigable, although several overpasses were built with very high clearances in anticipation of the shipping channel.  Locks were actually built 13 miles downstream of Dallas in the early 1900s.[10]  Original federal plans called for building 36 locks and dams from Trinity Bay near Houston to Dallas. The first built was Lock and Dam No. 1 in the city of Dallas at McCommas Bluff, directly west of Lincoln Memorial Cemetery. Lock construction came to a standstill in the wake of World War I, however. Only Lock and Dam Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 20 and 25 were built. There are currently no plans for addressing these old locks located in various spots along the Trinity River. However, the Corps is working nearby on the Dallas Floodway Extension Project. The DFE Project is under construction and is helping to fulfill their mission, as directed by Congress in cooperation with the city of Dallas. It is helping to lower flood risk, and provide ecosystem restoration and recreation to the citizens of Dallas.[11][12]The Trinity River Corridor Project is intended to transform the Trinity River flood zone in downtown Dallas into the nation's largest urban park, featuring three signature bridges designed by acclaimed architect Santiago Calatrava.A similar project is planned by the Tarrant Regional Water District, City of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Streams & Valleys Inc., and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop an area north of "downtown" as "uptown" along the Trinity River. This plan promotes a large mixed-use development adjacent to the central city area of Fort Worth, with a goal to prevent urban sprawl by promoting the growth of a healthy, vibrant urban core. The Trinity River Vision lays the groundwork to enable Fort Worth's central business district to double in size over the next forty years.Major flooding occurred on the Trinity River in the years 1844, 1866, 1871, and 1890, but a major event in the spring of 1908 set in motion the harnessing of the river. On 26 May 1908, the Trinity River reached a depth of 52.6 feet (16.03 m) and a width of 1.5 miles (2.4 km).[13]  Five people died, 4,000 were left homeless, and property damage was estimated at $2.5 million.Now the wreckage of a shed or outhouse would move by, followed by a drowned swine or other livestock.  The construction forces of the Texas & Pacific worked feverishly to safeguard the long trestle carrying their tracks across the stream. Suddenly, this whole structure turned on its side down-stream, broke loose from the rest of the track at one end and swung out into the middle of the current and began breaking up, first into large sections and then into smaller pieces, rushing madly along to some uncertain destination. [Approximately half a dozen of the workmen fell into the torrent at this point, exaggerated reports of their drowning swept the city.]Dallas was without power for three days, all telephone and telegraph service was down, and rail service was canceled. The only way to reach Oak Cliff was by boat.[14] West Dallas was hit harder than any other part of the city—the Dallas Times Herald said "indescribable suffering" plagued the area. Much to the horror of residents, thousands of livestock drowned in the flood and some became lodged in the tops of trees. The stench of their decay hung over the city as the water subsided.[13]After the disastrous flood, the city's citizenry wanted to find a way to control the unpredictable Trinity River and to build a bridge linking Oak Cliff and Dallas. The immediate reaction was clamor to build an indestructible, all-weather crossing over the Trinity. This had already been tried following the 1890 flood, the result was the "Long Wooden Bridge" that connected Jefferson Boulevard in Oak Cliff and Cadiz in Dallas, but the resulting unstable bridge was easily washed away by the 1908 flood. George B. Dealey, publisher of the Dallas Morning News, proposed a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) concrete bridge based on the design of a bridge crossing the Missouri River in Kansas City. Ultimately, a US$650,000 (US$18.3 million in today's terms) bond election was approved and in 1912, the Oak Cliff Viaduct (now the Houston Street Viaduct) was opened with festivities that drew 58,000 spectators. At that time, the bridge was the longest concrete structure in the world.[13]Following from the 1908 flooding, levees were first constructed in 1932. They were heightened in 1960 to the 30 ft that has been maintained to the early 21st century. Current plans to improve the existing levees are part of what is known as the Dallas Floodway Extension project and the Trinity River Project.  They entail extending two existing levees and raising two others, all adjacent to the downtown Dallas area.Downtown Dallas also suffered severe flooding in 1990.  Minor flooding of the Trinity River occurs frequently, such as, for instance, in the spring of 2015 and summer of 2022.[15]Coordinates: 29°44′35″N 94°42′12″W﻿ / ﻿29.74306°N 94.70333°W﻿ / 29.74306, -94.70333"
81 Armoured Brigade (South Africa);"81 Armoured Brigade was a Formation of 8th Armoured Division (South Africa), a combined arms force consisting of armour, mechanised infantry, and mechanised artillery.81 Armoured Brigade was activated on 1 August 1974 but can trace its origins back to an older structure in the late 1960s, called 16 Brigade, under the control of Northern Transvaal Command.On 1 August 1974, through a reorganization of the Army's conventional force, the name was changed to 81 Armoured Brigade.[1]Under this reorganisation, the following units were transferred to the new command:81 Armoured Brigade resorted under the new 8 Division.The Brigade's philosophy was to be up-armoured and highly mobile. All units in the Brigade irrelevant of their Corps was either to be armoured or mechanised. In light of this the Saracen armoured car was used for the last time by Regiment Northern Transvaal and the new Ratel Infantry Fighting Vehicle was introduced. Mechanised elements were also introduced to 17 Field Artillery where the Sexton, a 25-pounder artillery gun mounted on Sherman chassis was introduced.   Mechanised infantry was a new concept in 1975, the biggest change being the increase in tempo and close proximity to armour in battle. In 1976, 40 command group members of Regiment Northern Transvaal underwent mechanised conversion training at 1 SAI. Pretoria Regiment was also busy converting at the same time to a modernised version of the Centurion Tank, the Oliphant at the School of Armour. 2 Light Horse, the Brigades armoured car regiment, was attached following Operation Savannah to service in South West Africa and therefore was not involved in the mechanisation program at that stage.81 Armoured Brigade conducted its first training exercise at the General de Wet Training Range, Tempe, near Bloemfontein in September 1975 with Exercise Mainstay. Three combat groups were activated. Over a period of three months, the area was allocated from one combat group to the next.Because of the limitations of the General de Wet Range, a new Training Area was opened in the next year to accommodate large scale conventional war training, namely Army Battle School at Lohatla. The honour to use the new property for the first time rested with 81 Armoured Brigade, who conducted the following brigade exercises (Ex) over the next few years:[2]By 1984 various combat groups of 81 Armoured Brigade conducted operational service largely in the counter insurgency role. The most important of these was probably Combat Group Foxtrot. After retraining, combat groups left Lohatla for Oshivello and Ongiva under the command of the Joint Monitoring Commission. Some of these operations included:The climax of 81 Armoured Brigade was on 1 Aug 91 when the then Chief of the Army Lt Genl G.L. Meiring handed over National Colours to the following CF units of the Brigade (Unit Commanders and Regimental Sergeant Majors indicated):WO1 Sampie Claasen of Northern Transvaal Command trained members for the parade which he did excellently. The Brigade was congratulated by Chief of the Army for a spectacular parade.This was the final official act by 81 Armoured Brigade and the climax on a 17-year illustrious history.With the independence of Namibia, the conventional threat dissipated and the SA Army Command began a process of rationalisation. Brigade headquarters were now focussed on counter-insurgency support to regional commands. SA Army Implementing Instruction 3/91 gave orders for the disbandment of 81 Armoured Brigade, which happened on 29 Nov 1991. The CF Units under command were reorganised as follows:11 Field Postal Unit"

21st Indian Infantry Brigade;"The 21st Indian Infantry Brigade was an infantry brigade formation of the Indian Army during World War II.It was converted from the Quetta Brigade in September 1940, and assigned to the 9th Indian Infantry Division. In March 1941, it was transferred to the 10th Indian Infantry Division and took part in the Anglo-Iraqi War in May 1941. The brigade then moved to Egypt and came under command British Eighth Army between July and November 1942. It returned to Iraq, assigned to the 8th Indian Infantry Division, in November 1942 and moved with to Damascus in March 1943. In September the division arrived in Taranto in southern Italy and the brigade remained with 8th Indian Division throughout the rest of the Italian Campaign apart from short attachments to the British 78th Infantry Division in November 1943, and the British 6th Armoured Division between April and May 1944.[1]The following officers commanded the brigade during the war.[3]This article about a specific Indian military unit is a stub.

Northwestern High School (Rock Hill, South Carolina);"Northwestern High School is one of three high schools in Rock Hill, South Carolina, United States. It was opened in 1971 as the city's second high school, replacing Emmett Scott High School, which had been designated for African American students during the era of segregated schools. Along with rival Rock Hill High School, it is one of the 16 largest schools in the state by enrollment, with about 1,791 students in grades 9–12.Northwestern offers the International Baccalaureate diploma.[2]Presidential candidate Barack Obama spoke at Northwestern on October 6, 2007.[3]The Northwestern Trojans are in Region III-AAAAA in the state of South Carolina. There are seventeen sports with thirty teams representing the school. The Trojans have a rich tradition both on and off the field. The football team is consistently ranked in the top ten in South Carolina and has played in six of the last eight state championships winning the championship in 2010, 2013, and 2015. The soccer team has been in the state championship game five out of the last six years,[when?] winning the championship in the 2006 and 2008 seasons. In 2009, they had an undefeated season.[4]In the 4A State Championship game, the Trojans defeated Irmo 3-1, claiming the State Championship as well as the ESPN Rise High School National Championship.[5] The following season, the teams met up again in the 4A State Championship game.  Northwestern once again proved too much for the Yellow Jackets, winning 4-2. This secured their third consecutive championship and their fourth title in five years.[6]The boys' cross country team won the state championship in 2005 and 2006.In the 2009 football season, the Trojans defeated rivals South Pointe High School in the 4A state-semifinals on November 27, 2009, at the Rock Hill School District Football Stadium. This propelled them to the state championship game at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia where they lost to Berkeley.On July 10, 2010 it was announced that Northwestern would play South Pointe High School, in a nationally televised double-header on ESPN August 28. Northwestern showed their power offense in that game where they beat South Pointe 42–20. The key came when they scored five touchdowns in 4 minutes and 50 seconds in the third quarter, taking a 20–7 deficit to 42–20. In the 2010 football season, the Trojans had a perfect 15–0 season and went to the state championship game at South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium, playing Greenwood. The Trojans defeated Greenwood 42–10 and won the state championship. In 2012 second year head coach Kyle Richardson led the Trojans back to the state championship, where they lost to Greenwood in overtime.In 2010 QB Justin Worley was named National Gatorade Player of the Year, joining previous winners Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, and numerous other pro athletes. Worley is the first and only National Gatorade Player of Year from South Carolina.The baseball team is consistently in the playoffs, and has produced numerous collegiate players.Northwestern athletics have produced several collegiate student-athletes, going to such major universities as Virginia Tech, Clemson University, South Carolina, Florida State, Georgia, Notre Dame, Ohio State and The College of Charleston."
Patient Zero (film);"Patient Zero is a 2018 science fiction horror film directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky and written by Mike Le. The film stars Matt Smith, Natalie Dormer, Stanley Tucci, Agyness Deyn, and Clive Standen. The plot involves a group of survivors who set out to find an antidote for a highly contagious virus that turns the infected into a ravenous but highly intelligent new species.After a bidding war between several studios over a script penned by Le, Screen Gems eventually won the rights. Ruzowitzky signed on to direct in May 2014. Casting began in September 2014 and lasted until March 2015. Principal photography began on 3 March 2015 in London, before ending on 18 April.Originally set to be released in September 2016, Patient Zero was pushed back to February 2017, then was removed from the Screen Gems release schedule. The film was finally released through video-on-demand on 14 August 2018, with a limited theatrical release on 14 September by Vertical Entertainment.After an outbreak of a mutated form of rabies that spreads from animals to humans, over 7 billion humans are dead or infected. People who are bitten turn rabid in 90 seconds. Morgan (Matt Smith) was riding in a car with his wife Janet when they were attacked. Both were infected, but he remained human with the ability to communicate with the infected.Now with a large group of civilians, CDC scientists and U.S. military in an underground nuclear base, Morgan and virologist Dr. Gina Rose (Natalie Dormer) bring in the infected and interrogate them, hoping to find the Patient Zero and devise a cure. Gina struggles with tensions between herself, Morgan, and Colonel Knox, compounded by Knox being attracted to Gina while she is currently intimate with Morgan. Morgan visits with Janet, who is held captive amongst others in the underground base. She's being treated with an experimental treatment derived from Morgan's blood.Gina is shown with a positive pregnancy test. Bodies of fallen soldiers are being cremated when one opens his eyes and attacks the workers and soldiers. After a one-on-one fight with Knox, he is subdued and asks to speak with Morgan specifically, who is surprised that the patient is unaffected by the music that has driven the other infected into a rage. He even lights and starts smoking a cigarette from his pocket. The team assume he's closely linked to Patient Zero. The patient reveals that he was a college professor and his school was attacked by the infected during one of his lectures. He was bitten, but still maintains most of his human abilities. The Professor tells Morgan that the infected are evolved humans, a more advanced species who are at the top of the food chain. Their debate raises Morgan's suspicions, and soon Morgan finds that another of their previous patients, nicknamed Pete Townshend, has a transmitter sewn inside his chest, revealing that the infected laid a trap to learn where the base is located.The infected swarm inside, killing or infecting all the humans, including civilians. Now overrun Knox shoots his commander so the infected are slowed down long enough for him and Gina to make it to the elevator. Horrified by his actions, Gina grabs his gun. He tries to tell her he wanted to save her life. They begin to scuffle and the gun goes off, killing Knox. Gina goes to the cells where the infected are kept, and finds Morgan releasing Janet. Gina pleads with him to leave Janet since the treatments work but only temporarily, but he refuses. They sneak to Gina's lab, retrieve her samples, and crawl through the vents. They encounter an infected lab rat, which Janet kills before it can get to Gina. They make it to the parking lot just below ground level.The Professor confronts them and explains that he came to the base to kill Morgan. Morgan is their "Patient Zero" and is a threat to their survival. They fight and the Professor starts calling other infected, until Morgan impales him on a pipe. The trio flee until Janet tells them to run and she will buy them time, telling Morgan he must leave her to save the baby, as she sensed that Gina is pregnant. This distracts Morgan long enough for Janet to close a heavy vault door just in time to stop the horde. Through a window in the door, Janet wipes a tear from her face, indicating that she was now able to cry and that the treatment was working and restoring her humanity, and mouths "I love you".Morgan and Gina follow the tunnel out to the woods and find a motorcycle. They ride off into the night with Morgan understanding that he must do whatever it takes to take care of their baby and save some remnant of the human race.The script, initially titled Patient Z, was featured on the 2013 Black List, an annual survey showcasing the "most liked" motion picture screenplays unproduced.[1] Set in a post-apocalyptic world full of zombies, the story follows a man who speaks their language questions the undead in order to find a cure for his infected wife. The screenplay was the subject of a bidding war between several different studios including Fox Searchlight Pictures,[2] Silver Pictures, Davis Entertainment, Broken Road Productions, Donners' Company, Vincent Newman Entertainment and Misher Films.[2] Screen Gems eventually won the bidding war and Vincent Newman was set to produce through his company Vincent Newman Entertainment.[3] Austrian director Stefan Ruzowitzky was set to direct the film on 2 May 2014. When the screenplay was first sold, the creatures were zombies, though this aspect was eventually removed during subsequent rewrites.[4]On 24 September 2014, it was announced that Natalie Dormer would join the cast,[5] followed by Matt Smith joining that November.[6] Other roles were announced in early 2015 with Stanley Tucci joining in January,[7] John Bradley[8] and Clive Standen joining in February,[9] and Agyness Deyn joining in March.[10]Principal photography on the film began in London on 3 March 2015.[11] From 9 March, filming took place at Shepperton Studios[10] and would also take place in and around London through 18 April 2015.[10]Some filming took place in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire on 15 March 2015, where a SWAT van and car were seen on set.[12]In August 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that Patient Zero would be released on 2 September 2016 in the United States.[13] On 28 April 2016, the film was delayed to 17 February 2017.[14] In January 2017, the film was removed from the release schedule.[15] The film is scheduled to be released through video on demand on 14 August 2018, before receiving a limited theatrical release on 14 September 2018, by Vertical Entertainment.[16]The film was promoted at San Diego Comic-Con 2016, which was attended by Smith, Dormer, Standen, Bradley, Ruzowitsky and Le. On 11 July 2015, a rough cut of the film's trailer was screened during the Screen Gems panel.[17] Standen explained that the film's tension centers on the infected thinking they are "the new evolution of mankind" who want to wipe out the human race.[18]Patient Zero holds an approval rating of 14% on Rotten Tomatoes based on seven reviews, with an average rating of 4/10.[19]Geoff Berkshire, writing for the Los Angeles Times, described the film as "a post-apocalyptic pandemic movie that’s more grade-Z than World War Z", and concluded: "A near future where a divided humankind is so full of anger at people different from themselves that they literally turn into monsters? It’s a frightful thought for frightful times. But it’s also the only thought this slipshod thriller contains in its not-so-pretty little package."[20] Jeffrey M. Anderson of Common Sense Media gave the film a score of 1 star out of 5, saying that it "eventually wanders cluelessly off track, but, as it consists mainly of yelling, sudden loud noises, and camera-shaking, it gets aggravating long before that happens."[21]"

Rancho Deluxe;"Rancho Deluxe is a 1975 Neo-Western comedy film directed by Frank Perry.[1] Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston star as two cattle rustlers in modern-day Livingston, Montana, who plague a wealthy ranch owner, played by Clifton James.The film also stars Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Bright, Elizabeth Ashley, Maggie Wellman, Patti D’Arbanville, and Slim Pickens as the aging detective Harry Beige hired to find the rustlers.Jimmy Buffett contributed the music, and performed "Livingston Saturday Night" with alternate lyrics within the film in a scene set at a country and western bar.The script was by novelist Thomas McGuane.[1]Jack McKee and Cecil Colson are a couple of young, restless rustlers. Jack has turned his back on his wealthy family and his wife. Cecil is a Native American. Together, more out of boredom than anything else, they have begun rustling cattle, cutting them up with a chainsaw and paying bills with fresh meat in lieu of cash.Equally bored are wealthy Montana rancher John Brown and his wife, Cora. They once ran a beauty parlor in Schenectady, New York, but now they have bought up most of the land in this corner of Montana. Cora is so bored that she tries to catch the eye of her husband's dim ranch hands, Burt and Curt, but she can't seem to work up much interest on their part.The rustling of his livestock lights a fire under Brown, who sends Burt and Curt up in a helicopter to try to catch the thieves in the act. Jack and Cecil continue to single out Brown's cattle, even kidnapping "Basehart of Bozeman Canyon", his US$50,000 prize bull (equivalent to $251,793 in 2021), for ransom.Brown decides to call upon Henry Beige, said to be the scourge of rustlers everywhere. A legendary stock detective who once served time on a prison farm for rustling, Beige turns out to be a feeble old fool who doesn't seem to be interested in anything except watching TV and being waited on hand and foot by his beautiful niece, Laura, who is almost sickeningly sweet.Jack and Cecil are feeling cocky, so much so that when Burt and Curt figure out that they must be the rustlers, Jack and Cecil bribe them into a scheme to steal a semi-truck full of John Brown's cattle.Curt, however, has fallen head over heels in love with the luscious Laura, even though she still mistakenly calls him Burt. She is nowhere near as innocent as she seems, as she proves in a sexual encounter in the woods. Burt intends to use his rustling profits to take an expensive vacation in Mexico, but Curt has chosen to propose marriage to Laura.Henry Beige's seeming ineptitude and lack of interest in identifying the rustlers is infuriating to Brown, who angrily fires him. A distressed Laura explains to Curt that she needs to take care of her uncle and therefore will be leaving with him, unable to marry Curt.Curt decides to help Henry catch the rustlers instead. Henry proceeds to do exactly that, making a show of it before the town's citizens. Burt and Curt are also arrested, Curt coming to realize that Laura's sweetness and love for him were all an act.Henry Beige comes to Brown to say goodbye, nonchalantly accepting his payment because he says he's in it simply for the sport. Brown can see now that Henry is shrewd, not doddering at all, and Laura is a sexy, all-business woman, not innocent in any way.Jack and Cecil end up sent to the Montana State Prison Ranch at Deer Lodge, presumably the same prison where Henry Beige served time in his youth. They spend their days on horseback, seemingly no more or less bored than they had been before. The final scene shows the two rustlers riding under a sign reading "Rancho Deluxe".Principal photography began on April 29, 1974 in Livingston, Montana. Other locations including Paradise Valley, Montana where most of the valley sequences were filmed. The whole community of Livingston were also included for when the cast and crew were filming in town, including at a local bar named The Wrangler, The Holiday Inn motel, a popular local sporting goods store, individual houses and ranches in the area. For the final scene, the crew traveled to Deer Lodge, Montana to film the movie-ending sequence where the two characters are on horses at the prison ranch with the sign that reads Rancho Deluxe.  Filming lasted for two months and production wrapped in July 1974.Bridges met his future wife,  Susan Geston, while filming. She was working as a waitress at a ranch.[2][3]Rancho Deluxe was released in theatres on March 14, 1975.The film was described as a form of "parody Western" by critic Richard Eder in his Nov. 24, 1975 New York Times review.[1] "It is so cool that it is barely alive," he wrote of the film's general tone.[1] Among the positive elements: "Slim Pickens for once has a strongly written comic role. He plays it with great effect, and Charlene Dallas, as his sluttish assistant, is almost as good."[1]Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Rancho Deluxe only one-and-a-half out of four possible stars. He wrote: "I don't know how this movie went so disastrously wrong, but it did."On Rotten Tomatoes, Rancho Deluxe holds a rating of 70% from 20 reviews.[4]"

1912–13 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season;"The 1912–13 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 16th season of play for the program.Harvard entered the year with a team that may have been less talented than previous squads, but it was no less competitive.[1] The team displayed an increasing level of play throughout December between practices and scrimmages with the Boston Athletic Association. The available ice at the Boston Arena paid dividends for the Crimson in allowing them to hone their game in their attempt to reclaim the championship.The Crimson made up for last year's poor start with a dominant 4–0 win over MIT where the team used many of its backup players throughout the game.[2] After returning from the winter break Harvard faced a tough Ottawa team and could not find its footing offensively, losing 0–2 despite a stellar effort from team captain Gardner. The team buckled down and prepared itself for a match against Toronto a week later. When the Blues arrived in town they found an impenetrable wall in front of the Harvard cage and left after a 0–2 loss to the Crimson.[3]After dismantling Cornell 8–2, Harvard welcomed defending champion Princeton in one of the most anticipated games of the season. The teams locked horns and battled nearly the same as they had the year before, Princeton's offense, led by Hobey Baker applied a continual assault on the Crimson defenders but neither team could beat the other in regulation. With the score 3–3 the two teams had agreed to play two 5-minute overtime periods in case they were needed. Harvard was able to score once in each extra frame and take the game 5–3, putting themselves at a great advantage in their pursuit of a championship.[4]By the time Harvard played Yale on February 1, the teams had arranged a best-of-three series so that Harvard, Yale and Princeton would play one another at least twice. If any of the three emerged as a clear victor they would likely be able to claim the collegiate championship as the teams were typically among the best in the nation. Harvard's solid win over the Bulldogs had them on the cusp of a terrific season but in the second game against Princeton the Tiger attack was too much to cope with and a third game was required to settle the series. While the third game would not officially decide the champion, as Harvard still had Yale left to play, Princeton could secure the championship if it won the rubber match. With this in mind Gardner produced one of the most brilliant goaltending performances in school history, turning away 29 shots en route to a 3–0 victory, the only time in the three years with Baker that Princeton would fail to score.[5]With Yale still remaining, Harvard couldn't slow down if they wanted to claim the championship. The Elis played Harvard tough in the first half, scoring the only goal of the frame to put a bit of fear in the minds of the Crimson faithful. The game remained the same through most of the second half but with 5 minutes left the Crimson offense awoke and scored three times. Yale added one just before the end of the game but it wasn't enough to turn the tide and Harvard skated away with the collegiate hockey championship.[6][7][8]Note: Assists were not recorded as a statistic.† Statistics from the game against Dartmouth are not available.[9]"

Turracher Höhe Pass;"Turracher Höhe, also called Turracherhöhe, refers to a village, a pass across the Alps, and a countryside in the Gurktal Alps in Austria. The village and the Turracher Lake at the pass, which both share the same name, are separated by the border of the two federal states of Styria and Carinthia. Because of its distance to early settlement areas and its high location, the region was not settled until relatively late. In the 17th century, mining was started below the Turracherhöhe. The opening up of the top of the pass by a paved road did not occur until later. During the 20th century, the region was gradually developed for tourism. Efforts are being made to maintain thediversity of flora and fauna of the Turracherhöhe by means of landscape conservation areas and careful and nature-oriented extension of the tourist facilities.The Turracherhöhe is situated in the Nock mountains, the western part of the Gurktal Alps. The area extends from the peaks of the Rinsennock (2,334 m) in the west to the Lattersteighöhe (2,264 m) in the east, in the north-south direction, it extends from the village of Turrach to the plain of Reichenau in the south. Somewhat farther away are the peaks of Eisenhut (2,441 m), Großer Königstuhl (2,331 m), and Gruft (2,232 m).The highest point of the approx. two km long pass summit has an altitude of 1,795 m above sea level south of the Turracher Lake. The lake has a water level of 1,763 m above sea (Adria) level and is connected to the village. The Turracher Höhe, as a "classic" pass summit, is also part of a drainage divide between the Mura valley and the Upper Gurk River, whose source is beneath the Lattersteighöhe at approx. 2,000 m above sea level.The Turracher Road (B95), which goes from Salzburg along the western shore of Turracher Lake, connects the Styrian Upper Mura valley in the north with the Upper Gurk valley in Carinthia, and it continues further to Feldkirchen and the basin of Klagenfurt in the south. The road on the pass (from Turrach to the Reichenau plain) has a length of 16 km, the section between the junctions to the Murauer Road (B97) in Predlitz and the Kleinkirchheimer Road (B88) near Patergassen is 35 km long.A total of three municipalities share the region of Turracher Höhe: Styrian Predlitz-Turrach in the north and the Carinthian municipalities of Reichenau and Albeck in the south. There are no direct roads onto the pass summit from Albeck.For a long time, there were only single farmsteads and accommodations for lumberjacks who chopped wood for the mines and smelting works in Turrach, as well as for the seasonal miners and stonemasons, on the Turracher Höhe. A compact settlement did not develop until tourism emerged in the second half of the 20th century.Today, the village on the pass summit has around 100 inhabitants, and there are more than 400 secondary residences. Like the Turracher Lake, it belongs partly to the Styrian municipality of Predlitz-Turrach and partly to the Carinthian municipality of Reichenau. The border of the federal states runs roughly through the middle of the village and the lake. The northern part, which belongs to Styria, has the postal code 8864, the southern part on Carinthian territory has the postal code 9565, on the other hand, the telephone area code is the same for the whole village (04275).Thus, there are formally two villages on Turracher Höhe, where the Styrian part belongs to the district of Turrach in the municipality of Predlitz-Turrach, and the village of Turracherhöhe (official spelling) on the Carinthian side is a district of the municipality of Reichenau. But no town signs were installed within the village, a town sign at the entrance of the village announces the Reichenau district of "Turracherhöhe" on the Carinthian side, and a sign bears the inscription "Fremdenverkehrsgebiet Turracher Höhe" (Tourist Region Turracher Höhe) at the entrance to the Styrian village. Those who are not aware of the division of the village due to administrative politics can only suspect that the border between the two states runs here because of the two state flags along the former federal road.In the wide saddle of the pass summit, where the road runs horizontally for two kilometres, there are two luxury hotels, a resort belonging to the German trade union IG Bau and over 30 small and medium-sized hotels and guest houses. There are many vacation houses in the southern and western stone pine forest, as well as the eastern side of the lake. However, these houses are predominantly concealed by trees or are situated in hollows, so they barely stand out from the natural surroundings.The facilities include a bank and some shops for athletic items and souvenirs. But there is no grocery store or gasoline station in Turracher Höhe, for example. For a long time, there was also no church or chapel. An ecumenical place of worship was not built until 1985, at the suggestion of the inhabitants. It is administered by the parish of Stadl an der Mur and is available for all Christian creeds.There is plenty of sunshine during the entire year. Due to the high altitude, there is significantly less cloudiness and fog than in the Drau valley, for example. Thus, the average prevailing temperatures are also favorable: the average temperature in January is between -5.9 and -8.2 °C, in July it is between 10.6 and 11.0 °C, and the yearly median is 1.9 to 2.2 °C. By comparison, Klagenfurt, with a height of 447 m above sea level, is 1300 m lower than Turracher Höhe. Its average temperature in January is -5.8 °C, its average temperature in July is 18.3 °C, and its yearly median is 7.7 °C.The precipitation of 1,218 mm is rather low for the mountains. Snowfall normally starts in October at the latest, and a dense blanket of snow quickly forms, which remains until April or sometimes even until May. On average, there is snow for 158 days on Turracher Höhe.The name Turrach is derived from the old term, "Durrach", which was used for a forest, where there are a lot of fallen, dried up ("dürr") trees lying around. The term is widely used in Carinthia, as well as in the rest of Austria.While the region around today's Predlitz and the Mur was already colonised by Slavs in the 6th century, the first clearings and settlements south of Turracher Höhe are known to be from the early 14th century. Politically, the region was initially part of the duchy of Carinthia, but it was already divided among three territories in the 12th and 13th centuries, due to the splitting off of the Lungau to Salzburg and Murau to the duchy of Styria. Until tourism began to develop in the late 1920s, there had only been a few farmsteads north and south of the pass summit since the late Middle Ages, but no compact settlement. Also Turracher Höhe played no role as a traffic route for a long time. During the Middle Ages and early modern times, connections over the Katschberg in the west and over the Flattnitz in the east were the main traffic routes in the north-south direction, while routes over Turrach had only local importance, e.g. for the transport of salt from the Salzkammergut to Reichenau (first documented mention in 1332), where there was a branch of the toll office.In the upper Mura valley north of Turracher Höhe, the region around Predlitz (first documented mention in 1311) was sparsely populated because the slopes to the right of the Mura were less suitable for cultivation. During the Middle Ages, the dominant settlement of this region was Murau, which belonged to Liechtenstein. But south of Turracher Höhe, rural colonization around Reichenau, where there was also a regional court in 1520, provided more compact settlements and single farms.With a certificate issued in Moosheim dating from the year 1256, the Carinthian duke Ulrich III gave the minstrel and poet, Ulrich von Liechtenstein, the sovereign right for mining in the district of Murau, which contains the region around Turracher Höhe. However, concrete indications of mining in the Turrach region cannot be found either in this document or in the following centuries.In 1657, Johann Adolf Count Schwarzenberg, who ruled Murau, initiated the search for copper ore. In the Steinbachgraben, huge amounts of limonite (a type of iron ore) were found, whereupon the count asked Emperor Leopold I for a license for mining and smelting, which was issued on January 31, 1660. Already in the same year, Johann Adolf ordered the building of a bloomery for smelting iron in Turrach, and in 1662, the first tapping was performed. Initially the mining and smelting took place mainly on the Styrian side around the village at the northern foothill. In 1783, Count Johann Nepomuk Anton of Schwarzenberg ordered the extension of the road, which was 15 km long, from Predlitz to his factory in Turrach, in order to facilitate the ore transport. But there were routes for transporting wood and charcoal above the village, too, which reached today's pass summit.The general economic crisis resulting from the Napoleonic Wars and their consequences also reached Turrach's mining in the first two decades of the 19th century. Following that, the iron business—under Peter Tunner senior (the father of Peter Tunner), who led the company from 1823 to 1844—underwent a considerable advancement, due to the streamlining of working methods and the introduction of modern technologies. In the middle of the 19th century, the annual quantity of ore delivered by the approximately 60 miners amounted to about 100 to 120,000 quintals (approx. 5,600 to 6,700 t). At that time, mining was only done during the winter, because the ore had to be pulled to the smelting facilities in bags.As of 1863, a rocking Bessemer converter, which made the steel production more efficient, was used in Turrach. In 1865, three converters with a capacity of 35 to 40 quintals and two blast furnaces were available. At that time, the iron smelting facility was Styria's largest and was considered to be one of the most modern in Europe. In spite of the technical innovations, there was soon an economic decline. As of the 1870s, the sales worsened, the production of raw iron decreased from 3,800 to 1,500 t between 1869 and 1885. Besides increasing coal prices, Turrach's disadvantageous location off the major transport routes caused high transportation costs, which were responsible for the decreasing competitiveness of the iron companies. In 1899, the iron smelting facility was leased out, which brought no improvement, so the furnace in Turrach was finally shut down in the spring of 1909.Besides iron mining, copper mining occasionally played a role. Other natural resources are small amounts of high-grade anthracite coal, which was mined until the 1950s and 1960s. The mining of cinnabar at the Kornock can already be proven in the 17th century. A former stone pit at Lake Turrach, as well as a magnesium carbonate and a slate pit, are evidence of the mining activities around Turracher Höhe, which however were entirely given up in the course of the 20th century for economic reasons.In the 19th century, the first housing was built on the pass summit at the Turracher Lake. It served as accommodations, as well as for serving the lumberjacks, stonemasons and miners. Thus, it is known that at the provably oldest inn still existing today on the Turracher Höhe, the "Seewirt", there was already an Alpine public house in operation in 1830. Already at the end of the 19th century, the first tourists came for hiking on the Turrach and shortly before the First World War, the first skiers came for extended ski trips. Little by little, other hotels and inns also opened, among which are the "Jägerwirt" (1905), "Siegel" (1911) and "Hochschober" (1929), which still exist today.It has not been recorded when an old mountain track was converted into a road. On the south side, it is known that the stone "Teufelsbrücke" (Devil's Bridge) was built over the ravine of the Stangenbach in 1893. Between the wars, the streets, which already at that time essentially had the same course they have today, were adapted to the demands of modern automobile traffic. On the south side, bus service was established in 1928, and the bus line Predlitz–Passhöhe followed in the north in 1929. However, the first tourists were nevertheless forced to walk for kilometres to their quarters on the Turracher Höhe in the winter, since the buses could not manage the steep climb under winter conditions. The first private holiday home was erected on a small hill on the north side of Turracher Lake in 1936.In the winter after the Second World War, the first English tourists already came to Carinthia,which was occupied by the British troops. They were quartered in the seized businesses of Siegel, Hochschober, Jägerwirt and in the small holiday home. In 1946, a T-bar lift was built at about the same height as today's Kornockbahn and it was at first reserved for use by the English. Because of that, a lift on the Turracher Alpe is still called "Engländerlift" (Englishman's Lift) today. In the 1950s, the first single chairlift came, and the Panorambahn, as well. It was replaced in 1983 by a new single chairlift. This was also replaced in September 2006 by a new combination chairlift/cabin-lift. In 1966, the "Pauli Schlepplift" went into operation, named for Paul Pertl, which is still there today. A ski tow on the beginner's meadow was also added. In December 1976, the double chairlift, "Kornockbahn", opened, which was replaced with a six-person chairlift equipped with heated seats. The newest acquisition is the new stone pine forest six-person lift, as of 2006/2007.As of the 1970s, the crowd of winter athletes on the Turracher Höhe increased and as a result, the gradient of the federal road was evened out little by little by adjustments of the route. From 1978 until 1980, a new section of the road, which had been affected time and again by avalanches, was opened on the Kornock above the old road, with avalanche barriers.The steepest Alpine road in Europe at times, with a gradient of up to 34% at kilometre 60 (reckoned from Klagenfurt), was also sometimes a test stretch of the automobile manufacturer, Porsche, produced after the Second World War in nearby Gmünd in Carinthia, because of its high demands on automobiles. In January 1978, Audi presented the newly developed Audi Quattro to the company leadership on the Turracher Höhe, where the performance of the new all-wheel drive could be convincingly demonstrated on the steep, curvy and snowy road of the pass.The pass road has a maximum gradient of "only" 23% today on a short section on the Carinthian side. It is well cleared in the winter and only has to be closed very rarely.The dominant branch of the economy on the Turracher Höhe today is tourism. Besides hotels, inns and ski lift operations, as well as a few small shops and the mineral museum, no businesses are based here. After mining was stopped in the 20th century, the timber industry and forestry are the only "traditional" branch of business still existing on the Turracher Höhe, aside from a few small agricultural operations.There are still large expanses of woodlands in the Mura valley and in the region between Predlitz and the Turracher Höhe even today in family ownership, which come from the lands acquired by the House of Schwarzenberg in 1623. They are managed by the "Fürstlich Schwarzenberg'schen Familienstiftung" (Prince Schwarzenberg Family Foundation). The area managed by the forest administration in Turrach in the region of the municipality of Predlitz-Turrach is 8,411 ha in total, of which 5,804 ha are commercial forest and barrier woodlands, as well as 2,607 ha of Alpine and miscellaneous areas at an altitude between 930 and 2,434 metre above sea level. The trees felled by the forest administration of Turrach amount to around 24,000 solid cubic metres (or stères) per year, of which 79% is from clearcutting and 21% is from selection cutting.The woodlands on the southern side of the Turracher Höhe are also privately owned for the most part, 90% of the entire forest land of the municipality of Reichenau is distributed over plots of land of under 200 ha. The yield is mostly sold as logs, there are no sawmills or other wood processing operations in the immediate vicinity of the Turracher Höhe.Drinking water is supplied from two springs near the Grün Lake and a further one from Kornock. The quality of the drinking water and of the Turrach lakes is very good, since the community is connected to a public sewerage system which was built from 1967 through 1972, so that the accumulated waste water is diverted over the Reichenau plain to purification plants in Feldkirchen. The Turracher Lake was the first lake in Carinthia for which a sewerage plant was entirely completed.The Turracher Höhe was first connected in 1957 to the public electric supply system of KELAG, an Austrian electric company based in Klagenfurt. Up until then, electricity was produced by generators by each piece of property. With the construction of a district heating plant in 1997, hotels and many vacation homes are connected to an environmentally friendly supply of heating.The Turracher Straße (B95) crossing the Turracher Höhe has a comparatively low importance as a national north-south connection between Carinthia and the federal states bordering to the north, Salzburg and Styria. It was known as the steepest Carinthian pass road, however, it is more gentle today because the roadway was moved, so that no escape route is necessary. The roads which are used considerably more by long-distance traffic are the Tauernautobahn (A10) and the Katschberg Straße (B99) from Bischofshofen to Spittal on the west, which runs parallel to the A10, and the Friesacher Straße (B317) from Judenburg to Klagenfurt east of the Turracher Höhe.The Turracher Höhe is only sparsely served by public transportation. From Predlitz, where the "Predlitz Turracher Höhe" train station of the Murtalbahn is located, a bus line of the Verkehrsverbund Steiermark (Styrian Transport Association) runs to the pass summit a few times a day, and the same for a bus connection of the ÖBB (Österreichischen Bundesbahnen, Austrian Federal Railways) to Reichenau and further to Klagenfurt.The Turracher Höhe was developed for summer tourism as well as winter tourism. There were 233,000 overnight stays registered recently, two-thirds of them in the winter season of 2004/05 and one third in the summer season of 2005. A total of 1,350 commercial and 570 private beds were offered for guests. On average, 320 people are employed in the tourism trade per year. The extension of the tourist offerings has happened in a careful and natural way since the first national regional development concept of 1963. A development model for the years 2005 through 2015 (see External links) plans further development according to these principles. In summer of 2007, the new 1600 m long year-round toboggan run was opened.In winter, five chairlifts (one of them a combined gondola-chairlift beside the year-round toboggan run) and nine T-bar lifts along the 38 ski runs begin operation. The "Hausberg" is the Kornock (2.193 m), with two chairlifts running along its eastern slope, the Kornockbahn and the Panoramabahn. The station at the bottom of the Kornockbahn lift is in the middle of the village and also runs in the summer. On the northern slope of the Turracher Höhe, there is a demanding FIS ski run into the Turrach valley. In the eastern and western flanks of the saddle, there are longer ski runs of easy to medium difficulty.In total, 25 km of cross-country ski runs have been laid, with winter hiking paths beside them. On the lake, areas for ice skating and curling are kept free of snow. The "Seetaxi" is unique. It is a snowmobile with holding rods, which shuttles along the border between Styria and Carinthia between the ski lifts east and west of the lake and pulls skiers over the frozen lake without charge.The Turracher Lake is seldom used for swimming in the summer, since the water temperature rarely goes above 18 °C. That is why the offerings for summer tourism, which has only about half as many visitors as during the winter months, is essentially limited to the numerous hiking paths around the lakes and in the surrounding mountainous country. Five hiking trails are marked as so-called "Geopfade" (Geo-paths), with display boards describing places worth noticing ("Geopunkte", Geo-points) along the way. In the summer, two chair lifts and the toboggan run are also in operation.In addition, the Turracher Höhe is at the eastern edge of the Nationalpark Nockberge. About one kilometre before the Reichenau plain, the Nockalmstraße, a toll road, branches off to the national park from the Turracher Straße.The privately operated museum, "Alpin+Art+Gallery", was founded in 1960 as a small mineral museum and it was expanded and newly conceived in 2000. The original museum was in a converted Troadkåstn, as the grain silos in Carinthia are named. During the expansion, an additional building with 400 m² of exhibition space was added.In the village of Turrach at the foot of the Turracher Höhe, there is another museum, "Holz und Eisen" (Wood and Iron), which exhibits items from the time of mining in the region and also offers tours of the old buildings and mining tunnels. Additional articles from the mining and smelting operations can be viewed in the "Eisensaal" (Iron Hall) of Castle Murau. The famous Bessemer converter from Turrach is in the Technische Museum in Vienna today.The geological construction of the Turracher Höhe is characterised by various kinds of rock, as well as the effects of the tectonic movements, which became visible here and finally led to the formation of the Alps in the late Mesozoic era about 100 million years ago. The eastern Central Alps got their current structure at the end of the Tertiary Period.From the geological viewpoint, the Turracher Höhe and its further surroundings belong to the Gurktal layer, whose Paleozoic rocks slid over the more recent rock layer of the so-called Stangalm Triassic Period. On and under the course of the sliding, there are a whole series of smaller and larger deposits of siderite and limonite. Those are among the ones in Steinbachgraben and Rohrerwald near Turrach, which were the basis for the iron smelting there.The most commonly appearing minerals on the Turracher Höhe are the Gurktal phyllite (created in the Lower Silurian) and Eisenhutschiefer (Upper Silurian to Middle Devonian), and on the other side of the Gurktal layer also Altkristallin (paragneiss, mica schist, amphibolite), some of which were created in the Ediacaran Period. The narrow strips of the Stangalm Triassic Period, which lie between them, consist of limestone and dolomite.During the various ice ages of the Quaternary Period, the Turracher Höhe was glaciated. In the Würm glaciation, there were partial currents of the Mura glacier, which flowed out of the feeding area of the Niederen Tauern to the south. About 20,000 years ago, a strong warming within 1,000 to 1,500 years made the glacial net melt off. As a rare relic of the Würm ice age, there is a glacial mill west of Turracher Lake. Further effects of the glaciation can be observed in the shape of the terrain, as well as in many individual places of the Turracher Höhe. The rounded off mountain tops with tub-like depressions between them (cirques) are the results of the tectonic movements as well as the glaciation. One example of that is the Hohe Kor. There is also a further result of ice age glacial activity there, a moraine embankment.There are three lakes on the Turracher Höhe. According to legend, they were formed from the tears God shed when He saw the beauty He had created. By far the largest of them is the Turracher See (Turracher Lake), with an area of 19.4 ha. About 300 m away towards the east is the Schwarzsee (Black Lake, 2.6 ha). In the southern direction is the Grünsee (Green Lake, 1.48 ha). The two smaller lakes, left to nature, are less well known, since they are in a protected landscape area and no building is allowed on their shores, and because they can only be reached by footpaths.The surface of the up to 33 metre deep Turracher See is completely frozen over for up to six months of the year. Since water from the lake is used to create artificial snow, the water level in the lake can vary by a few metres in the winter.Aside from the lakes, marshes and bogs were also formed from the glaciers of the ice age because of the high level of the ground water. In the area of the pass summit, there are various types of bogs. In the area of the pass summit there are mainly fens with some smaller transitional mires and raised bogs. On the Kornock there is a vale moor  in more than 2,000 m above sea level. The most important bog area adjoins the Schwarzsee and is probably a part of this body of water which has already silted up.The Turracher Höhe is in the area between montane and alpine vegetation. From the lower areas going upwards, there are secondary spruce forests, interrupted by commercial grasslands, spruce-larch forests, stone pine and stone pine-larch forests, then heaths of dwarf shrubs and subalpine and alpine grasses.The predominant, extensive stands of stone pine (Pinus pinea) here are worth commenting on. They belong to the largest in Carinthia. The subalpine forests are often thinned out like a park, with an undergrowth including the ubiquitous rusty-leaved alpenrose (Rhododendron ferrugineum), as well as the alpine juniper (Juniperus communis subsp. alpina) and the spotted gentian (Gentiana punctata). On the Rauterriegel southeast of the Eisenhut, there is a spruce forest with a lot of stone pines. In the green alder (Alnus viridis) bushes at the avalanche slope southeast of the Rinsennock, there are many herbaceous tall forbs, such as monkshood (Aconitum napellus subsp. tauricum), masterwort (Peucedanum ostruthium), and Austrian doronicum (Doronicum austriacum). On the Kilnprein, there are large fields of mugo pine (Pinus mugo).On the pass summit, there is a transitional mire: in the mud sedge bog (Caricetum limosae plant community) grow, in addition to the mud sedge (Carex limosa, endangered) which gives the name of the plant community, also the lesser twayblade (Neottia cordata) and the dwarf birch (Betula nana). In the fen south of the Schwarzsee, a brown sedge marsh (Caricetum fuscae subalpinum community) with the endangered species common sedge (or brown sedge, Carex nigra), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) and bastard sundew (D. x obovata),  as well as dwarf birch. There is a vale mire on the Kornock. Aside from the dominant deer-hair sedge (Trichophorum cespitosum), there are alpine bartsia (Bartsia alpina), alpine butterwort (Pinguicula alpina) and bog-bean (Menyanthes trifoliata).In the subalpine mat-grass grasslands (Aveno-Nardetum plant community) are found the spring pasqueflower (Pulsatilla vernalis), the alpine pasqueflower (Pulsatilla alpina) and Scheuchzer's bellflower  (Campanula scheuchzeri). In the alpine bent sedge  grasslands (Caricetum curvulae), there are red-flowered dwarf primula (Primula minima) and sticky primrose (Primula glutinosa). In the coloured fescue grasslands on the south-facing steep slopes, there are the villous primula (Primula villosa, "red spike") in the dark blue flowered form endemic to the northern  alps. In the Polsterfluren,  Wulf's androsace  (Androsace wulfeniana), endemic to the eastern alps, and Wulf's houseleek  (Sempervivum wulfenii) grow.In the region of the Turracher Höhe, the entire spectrum of the Alpine animal world is found, with the exception of the ibex, which was never indigenous here. Besides hoofed game animals (red deer, chamois, roe deer) and the corvids (raven, jackdaw, magpie), there are also four members of the pheasant family (capercaillie, black grouse, willow grouse and hazel grouse) in stable populations. In predatory game animals, there are fox, badger, pine marten, stone marten, European polecat, ermine and least weasel. Birds of prey, such as goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, European kestrel, golden eagle, as well as more rarely Eurasian hobby and peregrine are also seen here. From the nocturnal birds of prey, there are the Eurasian eagle-owl, tawny owl, Tengmalm's owl and Eurasian pygmy-owl. There are also marmots.In the approximately 300 million year old slate from the Carboniferous Period, fossilised plants had already been found in the late 18th century. Scientifically recorded for the first time in 1835 by Ami Boué, there are 72 species of coal forest plants from the Stangalpe known today, among which are the giant horsetails (Calamites), Sigillaria, ferns (Pecopteris), Cordaites and conifers (Dicranophyllum).All references are in German.."
J. Ross Robertson Cup (senior ice hockey);"The J. Ross Robertson Cup is a Canadian ice hockey trophy. It is awarded annually in senior ice hockey to the champion of Allan Cup Hockey by the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA). It was donated by John Ross Robertson in 1899, and is the first of three similarly named trophies he established. His other eponymous trophies for the OHA include, the J. Ross Robertson Cup awarded to the annual champions of the junior division, and the J. Ross Robertson Cup which was formerly awarded to the annual champions of the intermediate division.The J. Ross Robertson Cup was donated by John Ross Robertson on December 3, 1898, to be awarded annually to the champion of the senior ice hockey division in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA).[1] Robertson served as president of the OHA from 1899 to 1905, had founded the Toronto Evening Telegram, helped establish The Hospital for Sick Children, and served as a member of the House of Commons of Canada for Toronto East.[2] He was against professionalism in sports. In his donation speech he said, that would help "our boys to be strong, vigorous and self-reliant", and that "sport should be pursued for its own sake, for when professionalism begins, true sport ends".[3]The cup was crafted by the Queen's silversmiths in London, and is made of sterling silver and lined with gold. The bowl is decorated with faces of lions and has three handles shaped as leopards. Each winning team receives its own shield on the plinth, with the player's names engraved on it. The J. Ross Robertson Cup replaced the Cosby Cup as of the 1898–99 season, and its first winner was Queen's University. The Toronto Granites who won the cup in 1922 and 1923, then won gold in ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics.[1]The J. Ross Robertson Cup was the first of three similarly named trophies Robertson donated to the OHA, which included the J. Ross Robertson Cup for the annual champions of the junior division, and the J. Ross Robertson Cup for the annual champions of intermediate division.[1][2]Championship trophy of:List of cup winners:[4] This article incorporates text available under the CC BY 4.0 license."
New Zealand coot;"The New Zealand coot (Fulica prisca) is an extinct bird in the rail family, Rallidae, that was endemic to New Zealand. It was described in 1893 by New Zealand naturalist, ethnologist and museum director Augustus Hamilton, from material he had collected the previous year at Castle Rocks on the Ōreti River in Southland.[1] The Latin specific epithet prisca means "old", referring to its subfossil occurrence. Remains have subsequently been found at several sites in both North and South Islands.[2]The New Zealand coot and the related Chatham coot (F. chathamensis) are classified as coots on the basis of anatomical features of the pelvis and humerus typical of the genus. There has been disagreement regarding the relationship between the two species. They have variously been considered full species, subspecies or lacking in taxonomic distinction. At one point a new genus, Nesophalaris, was proposed for them.[3] A review by Trevor Worthy and Richard Holdaway in 2002 recommended that both coots be treated as separate species.[4]Although the coot's body proportions were similar to those of living coots, it was larger than most, at about 1.8 kg (4 lb) in weight and a length of 40 cm (16 in), though it was still probably able to fly. It was also more terrestrial, with its remains discovered in inland forests and subalpine regions as well as coastal wetlands. Its bones have also been found in early Maori middens in coastal Marlborough, and it is likely to have become extinct through over-hunting.[4]"
The Architects Collaborative;"The Architects Collaborative (TAC) was an American architectural firm formed by eight architects that operated between 1945 to 1995 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The founding members were Norman C. Fletcher (1917-2007), Jean B. Fletcher (1915-1965), John C. Harkness (1916-2016), Sarah P. Harkness (1914-2013), Robert S. McMillan (1916-2001), Louis A. McMillen (1916-1998), Benjamin C. Thompson (1918-2002), and Walter Gropius (1883-1969).[1] TAC created many successful projects, and was well respected for its broad range of designs, being considered one of the most notable firms in post-war modernism.Norman Fletcher, Louis McMillen, Robert McMillan, and Ben Thompson first laid the conceptual foundation for what became the Architects Collaborative while they were classmates at Yale University, where they discussed forming "the World Collaborative," which would be an ideal office combining painting, sculpture, and architecture.[2]Upon graduation, Norman Fletcher worked with John Harkness during the war at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in New York, and later, John Harkness worked with Jean Fletcher for Saarinen and Swanson[3] in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan the firm started by Eliel Saarinen. Jean Fletcher and Sarah Harkness had both studied at the Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture.[2]This group of friends were committed to forming a collaborative practice. To help them navigate the professional world and lend notability to the firm, they sought to add a senior practitioner. John Harkness pitched the idea of joining the Architects' Collaborative to Walter Gropius, who had asked Harkness to teach a master's class at Harvard. Walter Gropius agreed and became the eighth member of the group.[2] Other principals came to include Richard Brooker, Alex Cvijanović, Herbert Gallagher, William Geddis, Roland Kluver, Peter Morton and H. Morse Payne, Jr.[4]The idea of "collaboration" was the basis of TAC. As described by McMillen, conforming to the ideal of anonymity helped bind the office together.[5] It was carried out in that an entire group of architects have their input on a project, rather than putting an emphasis on individualism. There would be a "partner-in-charge", who would meet with clients and have the final decision of what goes into the design. Originally, each of the eight partners would hold weekly meetings on a Thursday to discuss their projects and be open to design input and ideas. However, as the firm grew larger there were many more people on a team and it was more difficult to consolidate into one group. Therefore, many other "groups" of architects within the firm were formed and carried out the same original objective. The position of the firm's president would be rotated amongst the senior partners.TAC's initial work consisted of residential projects, mainly single-family houses. The most notable design was Six Moon Hill in Lexington, Massachusetts, a community dwelling in which several of the houses were the residences of the founding partners, excluding Gropius.  Another one of TAC's specialties in this period was school buildings, which included many elementary and secondary public schools throughout Massachusetts and New England. TAC also designed many buildings for universities, among which was the Harvard Graduate Center, a small campus of dormitories and a building devoted to student activities.King Faisal II had a bidding process for the redesign of the city of Bagdad in order to turn into a busting urban center, the process included many popular postwar architects including Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Josep Lluís Sert, and Alvar Aalto.[6] Gropius, alongside The Architects Collaborative designed and planned the entire campus for the University of Baghdad, from 1958 to 1963.[7][6] Only a few of Gropius' designs survived into the campus' final iteration, the faculty tower, a few classroom buildings, and the Open Mind monument.[6] The project was met with both financial and political difficulties over several years which hampered a timely completion.[7]TAC's other work included many corporate, government, and recreational buildings in both the United States and internationally.In its initial decades, TAC's architecture was mainly in the International Style, early examples of which had been created by Gropius and his colleagues at the Bauhaus and elsewhere. Starting in the 1970s, TAC's style largely shifted from modernism to postmodernism, which was generally coming into favor in the architectural field.As the firm's staff increased and the scope of the projects became more complex, and an office in Rome was opened in the 1960s, which oversaw projects primarily in Europe and the Middle East. This was followed by the opening of an office in San Francisco in 1985.Gropius was a part of TAC until his death in 1969 at age 86. The group continued on, but the firm fell into financial problems in the 1980s. This was largely due to TAC being unable to pay expenses which they owed to various financial institutions and other corporations. Among other things, the firm had been losing money in unbuilt designs, especially in the Middle East. TAC was bankrupt and closed in April 1995. In response, many archives and architectural libraries worked fast to retrieve TAC's drawings and records. The majority of these are now stored in the Rotch Library at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[8] While the innovative process the TAC architects believed so deeply was carried out successfully, it did not become the norm for architectural firms.For the most part TAC functioned as a team rather than on an individual basis, which was considered a unique method of architectural practice, which reflected Gropius' philosophy of working collaboratively with others when he was a Bauhaus instructor in Germany prior to TAC."

Cam switch;"Cam switches are mainly used within the low voltage range. On a shaft, switching cams are made of abrasion-resistant conductive material. By rotating the shaft, the contacts are opened or closed by the cams. Often, a plurality of cams are seated on a shaft, which simultaneously switch or switch several pairs of contacts.[1]Friedrich Natalis (1864–1935), who had been working for the Schuckert-Werke (later Siemens-Schuckertwerke) since 1897, had already developed the cam-switching principle in Germany before 1900. In 1895, however, Johann Sigmund Schuckert founder of the electrical engineering company Schuckert & Co supplied cam switches with cam rollers and spring-loaded individual switches (DRP 88586). Thus the term cam switch has been used for such and similar devices over the years. Schuckert also supplied the "carbon control switch" designed by Natalis since 1901 with copper-carbon switching devices with spark-blowers (common spark blowers for direct current or single-spark blowers for direct and alternating current). The main current cam switch retained some significance, even when the rifle control pushed it where it was more economical. In miniature machine construction, the cam switch probably did not appear until the early 1930s. In 1931 the American company General Electric GE released their switch SBl, a 20A auxiliary current control switch, basically a miniaturized image of the large main current control switches. The devices had simple interruption and silver crossover, in some cases they were equipped with a snap mechanism. In Europe around 1940, the first cam switch from Ghielmetti, Solothurn / Switzerland, began to replace conventional roller switches. Switches could also be supplied as auxiliary current control switches with corresponding circuits. They were marketed under the trade name Ghielmetti-Clavier. In September 1948, Kraus & Naimer (of Vienna) produced C15 (15 A), the first company-owned cam switch. In 1949, the company also presented the world's first cam-designed cam switch. At the beginning of 1950, Kraus & Naimer cam switches C30 (30A) were followed with the same design. The Kraus & Naimer cam switches C16 to C200, which came into the market in the spring of 1951, had a decisive influence on the advancement of the cam switch and the introduction of the roller switch in electrical engineering. They had a double interruption and a motor switching capacity appropriate to the rated current. The large number of possible combinations and the extensive additional equipment as characteristic features were responsible for the later development of cam switches as an industrial standard.[2] Kraus & Naimer developed the world's smallest cam switch (model CA4N),[3] which is in the market since 1994.Precision Mechanisms Corp. (PMC) was started by Leon N. Canick & Charles S Aldrich, the original company President & Vice President respectively, both Chief Engineers in 1957. Mr. Canick was a graduate of Columbia University, a mechanical engineer by trade. Mr. Aldrich was a graduate of Cooper Union University and also a mechanical engineer by trade. Both were former employees of Bell Labs, and also Servo Mechanisms Corp. where they both held senior mechanical engineering positions. Mr. Aldrich (Charlie to most) was credited with the design of the PMC Cam Switch and was the creative and innovative individual behind the scenes, whereas Leon was responsible for the business side of the company.The primary application include throttle control modules, flap/slat position controls, landing gear controls, bay door control and position indication, and in other similar functions where a rotary control and/or position monitoring are required.The uniqueness of our products is in the air design for weight and size and the ease of adjustment of the cam mechanisms. The patented cam mechanisms on each individual stack allow to accurately set desired angles even under conditions of corresponding shad linkage variations, especially when working with detentes.For switching purposes, we use exclusively Honeywell micro-switches only. Low loads are handled with application of golf contacts. Reliability is a high reaching millions of cycles for mechanical life and hundreds of thousands for electrical life.We design and manufacture our own gear boxes in combination with our cam switches and procured synchros and/or potentiometeres. We make cable assemblies and are qualified in Mil-Std-2000 soldering and harness manufacturing procedures. Our statistical process control system had been approved and certified by Lockheed Martin.A Low Torque, Precision Component with Adjustable Snap-Action Switching•	Adjusts to any desired switch dwell angle from 3° to 357 ° of shaft rotation.•	Switch settings infinitely adjustable with respect to shaft.•	Switch setting independent of other switches in stack•	Switching angles cane be set and locked in seconds•	Adjustments can be made while shaft is either stationary or rotating•	Only 1-1/16" diameter, equivalent of BuOrd Size 11.The PMC Model CS 402 Cam Switch combines in a compact 1-1/16" diameter unit all the functions of a conventional plate cam, cam follower and snap-action switch. External screwdriver adjustments permit rapid setting of any desired switch make angle. Designed for timing, indication, control, computation and other applications where snap action switching is required, it permits the instrument and servo designer to meet specific application requirements through use of a single component that can be mounted in a gear assembly in a manner similar to synchros, potentiometers and other rotating shaft components. Because the CS 402 Cam Switch replaces conventional cam mechanisms, independently mounted switches and their associated hardware, it provides significant savings in design, fabrication and assembly time. Its small size permits significant improvements in miniaturization of the end product.Adjustment of the CS 402 Cam Switch can be accomplished rapidly and precisely while the shaft is either stationary or rotating, by means of two external adjusting screws, and can be completed within seconds. As a result, it provides a unique means for ‘trimming-in’ required performance in production or during equipment maintenance. Conveniently located locking screws maintain switch settings under all conditions of shock and vibration encountered by military equipment. Model CS 402 Cam Switches incorporate standard type SPDT, subminiature, snap switches and are available as single-switch units, or as multi-ganged types with as many as 10 switches. Both single and multi-stack types can be supplied with double-ended shaft for mounting dial or indicator. All types meet applicable requirements of MIL-E-5400. "
Voter turnout in the European Parliament elections;"Elections to the European Parliament saw declining voter turnout between 1979 and 2014. However, voter turnout in 2019 European elections increased by 8 points compared to 2014.[1] In spite of this exception for all Member States, the electoral mobilization remains weak compared to the national parliamentary elections.[2]  Moreover, turnout significantly differs from one country to another in Europe and across a time: in 2019 Belgium citizens participated the most with 88.47% and Slovakians the less with 22.74%.[3] The potential factors that might influence these trends and their implications have attracted great scholarly attention. Identifying and analysing the factors that determine the relative low turnout at European elections is therefore critical, as it is one element that weakens the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament.While the gender-equal turnout at the national elections in established democracies[4] has been mostly reached "as new cohorts of women entered the electorate",[5] men are still slightly more inclined than women to participate at the European elections.[6]  Indeed, in 2019, a gap of 3 points (-1 pp compared to 2014) was still observed between women (49%, +8 pp) and men turnout (52%, +7pp).[7]This gender gap does not seem to be rooted neither in gender per se nor in institutional features [8]  as the European Parliament present a  "more egalitarian representation of women than that of its member countries' lower houses".[9]  The literature rather emphasises that, because of their "political socialisation",[10] women are less likely to turnout because they express lower levels of interest and knowledge in politics[11] in elections considered as less important[6] (e.g. at the European level).In spite of the 2004 enlargements that have considerably "lowered the voting age", younger people have always participated less  in the European elections than their elders.[12] An important part of the literature[13][14] emphasises the effect of "age" or "life-cycle"[15] according to which young people are less likely to vote because they are still in "transition to adulthood",[16] building their professional career and family.[15]  Through ageing, individuals acquire more "resources and political experiences",[17] and face "fewer time constraints"[15] and stronger "conformist behaviour of voting" [18] pushing them to cast their vote.Another part of the literature stresses that these trends might not be "due to age per se"[15] but to "socialisation experiences" through which individuals "acquire the habit of voting to a greater or lesser extent"[17] than the previous and the next generation. Smets considers "later maturation" of "young adults these days (...) less inclined to vote than their parents or grandparents in their younger years".[19] While, until 2014, these explanations have found supporting evidence at the European elections, the unexpected turnout increase in 2019 has been noticeably driven by greater mobilisation of younger people, reducing the generational gap compared to 2014.[20] Indeed, while individuals "aged 55 or over" still represent the majority of the electorate (54%, +3 pp), the participation of "people aged under 25 (42%) and aged 25–39 (47%)", have grown respectively of 14 and 12 pp compared to 2014.[21]As for national elections, scholars mainly agree[6] that individuals with higher levels of education, income and socio-economic status are more likely to vote. In 2019,  the participation of highly educated individuals (who have "left education at the age of 20 or above")  grew from 36% to 39% compared to 2014, while turnout of people who did not continue school after 15 years old has decreased from 14 to 18%. Similarly, the positive relationship between socio-economic status and turnout has also increased through time :   employed individuals (especially "managers, other white collar and manual workers") were more likely in 2019, than unemployed people to cast their vote.[21] While a comparable positive relationship has been found with financial situation, (ie. 54% of voters have in general no difficulties to pay bills)  people who have more financial difficulties are also more inclined to vote than in 2014 (38%, +6 pp).[22] Moreover voter profile was in 2019 more urban than in 2014.Although these sociological factors are strong predictors per se of political engagement, they only depict one part of the picture. First,  while levels of “education and incomes have steadily increased in industrialized democracies during the past 50 years",[23] electoral participation have generally declined in both national and European elections (except in 2014). Additionally, Mattila consider these analyses as “more descriptive than explanatory”,[24] as they are limited  in explaining the process by which turnout is fostered. Besides, these have been considered to fail to explain why turnout decline occurred while education level or the share of the middle classes increased in European democracies.[25]High levels of knowledge[26] and interests in politics,[27] sense of duty to vote and "regular consumption news media engage in political discussions"[28] have been commonly considered as significant predictors of turnout. If the explanatory power of political interest increased at the last European elections where individuals with "a strong political interest" were 4% more likely to vote than in 2014 (20 to 24%), a similar increase have been observed among abstainers[21]. However, Stockemer and Blais argue that when related to national politics only "good knowledge", strong interest and a strong sense of duty to vote "might not be sufficient" to explain participation at the European elections.[29]Stockemer and Blais found that someone expressing a  "sense of duty to vote" only at the national level has 10% less chance vote at both national and European elections than someone that also perceives this duty at the EU level. The last European elections have been "boosted by a greater sense of civic duty"[30] compared to 2014.Other attitudes towards domestic politics might matter. People affiliating themselves with right or left on the political scale are continuously more inclined to vote in the European elections than those individuals in "the centre of the political scale".[22] Another focus is made on government approval, trust of national institutions, and perceived corruption at the national level.[31] Although a stronger government disapproval clearly does not encourage people to go to the polls[32], no clear correlation between strong confidence towards national institutions and greater turnout at the European elections has been enlightened so far[33][34].The effect of EU-related attitudes on the participation at the European elections is somehow debated. While some have emphasised pro-European attitudes as more efficient to foster voting participation at European elections, than Eurosceptic ones,[26][35] others[36][37][27] have argued that the significance of such attitudes was negligible if not non-existent  when controlling for the sociodemographic and attitudinal variables mentioned above.[37] Accounting for attachment to European identity,[38] Studlar et al. found a positive relationship between stronger attachment to that notion among voters and turnout.[39] In the same vein, analysing the European elections from 1979 to 2009, Stockemer found that  those who "consider country's membership in the EU ‘a good thing’ have a higher likelihood of voting in EP elections than those who reject it".[40] Not only the 2019 post election survey has confirmed this trend, but also [compared to 2014] "more respondents (...) voted because they were in favour of the EU and declared this support to be their main voting motivator".[20] Similarly, the literature stresses that distrust in European institutions and their politicians has also been considered as strong motivation for individuals do decide to abstain.[26][41][42]Overall, EU related attitudes focus has also been considered as over-simplistic, treating “public attitudes towards the EU as one-dimensional (...) taking only positive or negative values” disregarding existing “ambivalent or indifferent feelings”.[43]  Studying 2004 and 2009 elections, Kentmen‐Cin shows that ambivalent individuals -  "who simultaneously hold positive and negative [EU] attitudes" are more likely to cast their vote "compared to both negative and indifferent attitudes".[44]  Therefore, while bearing contradictory "views of European integration", ambivalent people prefer to raise their voice rather than exiting, seeing vote as an opportunity to improve the EU systems.[43]Accounting for ambivalence and indifference is even more relevant in views of the “second order” status European elections have for many electors[45] (see institutional factors).Cross-national analyses emphasises institutional factors related to the electoral system. Increasing the financial and moral costs of abstention,[42] the role of compulsory voting in explaining general turnout decline is widely recognised in the literature.[46][36] Indeed, while in 1979 "40 percent of participating countries" has compulsory voting, in 2019 that system remained active only in Belgium and Luxembourg "so the effects of this variable have become increasingly diluted"[47]Mattila underlines the role of "open party lists" (compared to strict ones) extending the variety of choices of voters beyond political parties to candidates, that in turn foster turnout. Similarly, holding elections into "multiple constituencies"  may encourage voters to participate in choosing candidates they feel closer to ("of their own constituency") and whose it is easier to obtain information.[48] Other scholars consider the patterns of  party competition as follows: the higher "the number of political parties" winning seats at the European elections is, the "more meaningful voter choice is likely to encourage turnout".[49]Studying European elections from 1979 to 1999 Studlar et al. demonstrate that "hosting an Eu institution and being a founding member of the European Community," foster "greater EU awareness" that might result in greater turnout.[49] Turnout differences between old and new Member States has attracted great scholarly attention.[50]Historically speaking, Wessels and Franklin proposed to challenge Rose's thesis[51] that limited voting participation in new members states was due to the “post‐communist” status (i.e. “lack of trust in political parties and governments, legacies of communist rule”), arguing that cross-national differences in turnout are partially due to a weaker “European identity and political community” in eastern states that constrain/limit “political commitment and participation”.[52]Economically speaking, Mattila shows (building upon Gabel's research[53]) that citizens living in "net beneficiaries" countries (i.e. benefiting financially from EU membership), are more likely to cast their vote than those living in "contributor" countries.  According to him, the information, spread by the media and the political sphere, that a given "country has to finance other member countries through taxes” might influence citizens' decision to abstain.[54]Finally, according to Franklin, after the 2004 elections, new EU countries have lost  "the boost to turnout that new member countries generally enjoy at their first EP election".[55]Reif and Schmitt[45] developed in 1980 the second-order theory, the "most famous explanation for EP elections",[56] that generated a fruitful literature. According to this theory, European elections are dominated by "domestic political cleavages (...) because they happen "at different stages of the national political systems’ respective “electoral cycles”,[57] implying lower turnout "because less is at stake" than in domestic elections.[58]  Some scholars emphasise the effect the perceived "low salience" [59] of the European Parliament on the decision-making process has on their intention to vote,[60] others[60][61] underline that for citizens, European integration is addressing issues too distant from their everyday lives “for them to have sufficient interest, awareness, or emotional attachment".[62]  Indeed, the EU (and especially the European Parliament) remain mainly non competent of citizens' main priorities ("reduce poverty and inequality", "combat terrorism and organised crime", "improve the quality of education"[63]). In the same vein, Hobolt et al. argue that "governing parties are generally far more pro-European than the typical voter" thus discouraging them to cast their vote.[64] In order to reduce the "second election problem", Bright, Garzia  and Lacey, provided evidence that  "transnationalising Europe’s voting space (...) would force political parties to move away from campaigning solely on national issues".[65]Building on this, Van der Eijk et al.  stress that European elections (unlike national ones) "are less important precisely because they play no role in deciding who governs the country".[66] As a response to the continuous turnout decline, the spizenkanditat process during 2014 European elections was expected to establish a direct "electoral connection" between the voters and the appointment of the president of the commission.[67] Such personalisation was intended to  ensure ‘public identification of the options on the EU table and the winners and losers in the EU.[68] While electoral participation increased in some countries,[69] whether this was due to this phenomenon or to others factors' role is still a debated issue. Moreover, as the majority of voters did not show up in 2014,[70]  Hobolt concludes that this process did not have a significant impact on voter attitudes who happened to be less interested in the choice of candidates than expected.[70]Taking a step back from the rational-choice approach, some studies analyse the impact of contextual factors on turnout. "Sunday voting", has been found to increase turnout[71] as it decreases the cost of voting.[42] Similarly, closeness to another election[72] and shorter "time until next elections"[71] should grow the incentives for parties to mobilize their supporters, which should lead to higher turnout".[49] Other "circumstantial reasons for abstention" have been considered such as "pressure of work, being too busy, or simply ‘having no time’, which together account for 29% of circumstantial abstention".[73]Some scholars consider the so-called "communication deficit" as partially responsible for the low public interest and turnout at the European elections. Greater positive media coverage of European issues, actors and electoral campaigns have been associated with higher turnout,[74][75][76]  (even if scepticism remains[77]).  Media coverage has, before 2014 elections, "increasingly integrated Europeanized public sphere"  : across Member States, citizens had access to similar "European issues, European actors and EU responsibility" while "the national framing also remained dominant".[78] This trend has also been observed in the post electoral survey of 2019  when "44% of respondents recalled seeing or hearing messages from the European Parliament encouraging citizens to vote. This recall is highest among respondents who actually voted in the elections (50%), but also 39% of non-voters recall having seen or heard elements of Parliament's go-to-vote message. ".[1]Focusing only on political communication through the media and political discussion, some scholars admit the limits of their approach leading too often “ to ‘blame the messenger’ for more deep-rooted ills of the body politic”.[79] An accurate understanding of rising abstention at the European elections cannot be conducted without accounting for the role of other mobilizing agencies “such as political parties in activating support”.[80]Thus, scholars debate on the impact that exposure to electoral campaign has on turnout at the European elections.[38] A large part of the literature found evidence that the mobilisation through campaigning is more efficient at the national than at the EU level.[81][82]Through the "mobilization deficit hypothesis",  Wessels and Franklin found that strong campaigning efforts to spread information through the media and to mobilize voters significantly foster turnout.[83] Building upon this framework, Marquart and Goldberg propose to distinguish "citizens’ passive exposure" ("to media coverage of the EP election campaign and targeted efforts of parties")  from "active engagement " (i.e. information research or engagement within an electoral campaign).[84] They found that for boosting abstainer to change their mind, "active engagement" is more efficient than "exposure to political posters" which is not sufficient.[85] Furthermore, they stressed "a potentially ‘toxic’ information and communication environment on social media, in which the diversity of opinions and information also increases the likelihood that citizens are exposed to critical content about the Union" and thus not go to the polls.[85]Traditional right and left-wing parties that have dominated post-war European politics have continuously lost voters. Between 2014 and 2019 the Christian Democrats (EPP) and the Social Democrats lost 39 and 37 seats respectively.[86]As an explanation, Hix and Harsh emphasise that the European elections are seen as an opportunity by voters to punish parties in government.[87] Party size might also have an effect:  "the larger a political party is , in terms of its vote-share in the previous national election, the more votes it will lose in the subsequent European election".[88]Alternatively, van der Eijk and Egmond argue that turnout impact differs according to the placement of parties on the political scale. While "right-wing parties benefit slightly from them (on average) and left-wing parties are (on average) somewhat hurt".[89] In countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Denmark or Austria, this phenomenon has been correlated to “the support of the established protagonists of the populist radical right, such as the French National Rally (RN), the UK Independence Party (UKIP), the Danish People's Party (DF) or the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ)”.[90]Studying abstainers' electoral choices at the 2009 and 2014 European elections, Remer-Bollowa, Bernhagena and Rose simulations forecast that "left-leaning and ideologically moderate parties would gain if turnout went up to levels observed at first-order national elections" while "Eurosceptic or Europhile parties" that "would not been affected".[91] The turnout increase (especially of young people) at the 2019 European elections seems to partially support this thesis with "the success in several countries of the green candidates and the failure of populist parties to achieve an electoral breakthrough".[92]The strong abstention at the European parliament elections is considered as undermining the democratic nature[93] of European Union as a whole "because it calls legitimacy into question or because low turnout implies lack of representation of certain groups".[72] Indeed, support for populist parties partially stems from the voters' perception that the European institutions are not sufficiently democratic. Limited turnout is also seen as eroding  EU's credibility to promote democracy abroad through projects "that strictly apply the principles of democracy and human rights".[94]"
Murder of Tijana Jurić;"Tijana Jurić (Serbian Cyrillic: Тијана Јурић, 4 May 1999[3] – 26 July 2014) was a 15 year old Serbian girl from Subotica, who was kidnapped and murdered in the night between the 25 and 26 of July 2014, near the Village Bajmok. She was seen for the last time 25 minutes after midnight, near the sports-center "Rata" in Bajmoka, while her body was found 12 days later, on August 7, on a neglected dump in Čonoplja in the municipality of Sombor. Dragan Đurić has been found guilty for murder and sentenced to 40 years in prison.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]Tijana disappeared in the night between 25 and 26 of July 2014, near the village of [Bajmok] in Vojvodina. The fifteen-year-old returned from the sea that day, on Friday, 25 July, at around 4 pm (16.00), where she was together with the company [specifically in Buljarica, organized by the school. The same evening she went by train to Bajmok, to meet her friends after the sea  She was wearing a white T-shirt, bright jeans and white "old women". Her grandmother and grandfather live on her mother's side in Bajmok.Arriving in the village from her native Subotica, she called her mother. She went to the "Stevan Vitković Riba" indoor soccer tournament, which is held once a year in the Bajmoc hamlet of Rata. She spent the whole evening with friends. Around midnight, she went home, in the company of a girl and a boy. In the middle of the road, she decided to head back to Rata, to return the sweatshirt she had borrowed the other night (even though she had her sweater), and Jurić went back to the Sports Center "Rata".According to the reconstruction presented by her father Igor Jurić, Tijana, returning alone on the same road, walked down JNA Street. On the corner of Tri istarske žrtve and Njegoševa streets, she met her friends about half an hour after midnight (00.25). When asked where she was going, she replied that she was going to return the borrowed sweatshirt. She continued down the street Tri istarske žrtve, crossed the railway and took the dirt road that leads to the sports field where a friend was waiting for her, whose sweatshirt she had borrowed. As she did not come for a long time, a friend from the field went to meet her. Tijana, however, was not there, and on the dirt road, about a hundred meters away, there was her white sneaker of the "Converse" brand (popularly "old woman"). It has been estimated that a maximum of seven minutes elapsed between the time she was last seen and the time her sneaker was found. She enrolled in music high school, majoring in cello and ethnomusicology. At the entrance exam, necessary for enrollment in this type of high school, she achieved the maximum number of points. She attended elementary music school for ten years, during which she won six awards at international and national competitions in this field."

Abdul Ghani Khan;"Khan Abdul Ghani Khan SI (Pashto: خان عبدالغني خان, c. 1914 – 15 March 1996) was a Pashtun philosopher, poet, artist, writer and politician. He was a son of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a prominent British Raj-era Indian independence activist. Throughout his life as a poet in both British India and Pakistan, Khan was known by the titles Lewanay Pālsapay (لېونی فلسفي, 'Mad Philosopher') and Da īlam Samander (د علم سمندر, 'Ocean of Knowledge').[citation needed]Khan was born in Hashtnagar, in the Frontier Tribal Areas of British India—roughly located in the modern-day village of Utmanzai in Charsadda District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. He was a son of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a prominent Indian independence activist, and was the elder brother of Abdul Wali Khan. Khan's wife, Roshan, was from a Parsi family and was the daughter of Nawab Rustam Jang a prince of Hyderabad.[1]  He went to study at the art academy at Rabindranath Tagore's University in Shantiniketan, where he developed a liking for painting and sculpture.[2] He visited England and studied sugar technology in the United States, after which he returned to British India and started working at the Takht Bhai Sugar Mills in Takht Bhai in 1933.[3] Largely owing to his father's influence, Khan was also involved in politics, supporting the cause of the Pashtuns of British India. Due to his activism, Khan was arrested by the Government of Pakistan in 1948—although he had given up politics by then—and remained in prison till 1954, in various jails all over the country. It was during these years that he wrote his poem collection, Da Panjray Chaghaar, which he considered to be the best work of his life.[citation needed] His contribution to literature (often unpublished) was ignored by the Pakistani government for much of his life, although near the end of his life, his works did receive much praise and as well as an award—for his contributions to Pashto literature and painting, the then-President of Pakistan, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, conferred on him the Sitara-i-Imtiaz on 23 March 1980.[citation needed]During a part of Ghani Khan's life, modern-day Pakistan did not exist. India was under British rule (hence called British India) and was fighting for its independence from the British. On 15 August 1947, India finally gained its independence. And a day before, on 14 August 1947, Pakistan had been born, becoming independent of British India. Hence, before all this independence, the Pashtuns who are now in Pakistan were under the rule of British India before the partition of India and Pakistan. This is where and why Bacha Khan's work was significant.As for Ghani Khan, he was initially influenced by his father's political struggles and thus worked for the independence of the Pashtuns ruled by British India. However, he later came to disagree with his father's ideologies (he stopped supporting the idea of nonviolent resistance, seeing that it was not beneficial to the Pashtuns). He says, in an interview, that he left his father's political movement of non-violence, called "Khudai Khidmatgar" ("God’s Soldiers") because of some of the movement's motives that he disagreed with.[citation needed]Although he was no longer involved in politics by the time of Pakistan's independence (1947), the government of Pakistan imprisoned him several times, sending him to jails from all over the country. His father spent close to half of his lifetime in jail (44 years out of his 99 years). Ghani Khan used his time in jail to write poetry, his main work in jail is called Da Panjrey Chaghar ("The Chirping of the Cage").Aside from a few poems of his youth and early manhood, Ghani Khan's poetry, like his temperament, is anti-political. His poem collections include Panoos, Palwashay, De Panjray Chaghar, Kullyat and Latoon. He also wrote in English, his first book was The Pathans (1947). His only published work in Urdu was his book titled Khan Sahib (1994).The singular distinction of his poetry – aside from his obvious poetic genius – is a profound blend of knowledge about his native and foreign cultures, and the psychological, sensual, and religious aspects of life.[4][5]A translation (Pashto to English) of selected 141 poems of Ghani Khan, called The Pilgrim of Beauty, has been authored by Imtiaz Ahmad Sahibzada, a friend and admirer of the poet. The book was printed in 2014 in Islamabad, Pakistan. It is a joint initiative by individual donors in Pakistan and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, Afghanistan. The book also contains paintings of Ghani Khan. The Pakistan launch of the book took place in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Pukhtun Festival, in March 2015. The Afghanistan launch took place on 22 February 2016 by the Ministry of Information and Culture.In 1982, At Edwards College Peshawar, Quaid Muhammad Khan(President Of Pushto Literature) familiarized Ghani Khan with Sardar Ali Takkar so that he could be able to read Ghani Khan ghazals with some music at the background (Modern Day Tappy).Ghani Khan's love for nature and the local habitat of the Pashtun people is visible in his work.  He wroteGhani khan poetryڅوک دې ماته وُوائيڅه رنګې شیدا شي څوک؟څوک چې چاته وُخانديولې پۀ خندا شي څوک؟ستوري د غره څوکې تۀغلي شان بېګا وُوېمینې پۀ ژړا وُوېحسن پۀ خندا وُوېAbdul Ghani Khan died on 15 March 1996 and was buried in Utmanzai, Charsadda.[6]After his death, in recognition of his outstanding achievements, the Government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province built a public library and park as a memorial to him on about 8 acres (32,000 m2) of land, naming it "Ghani Derai" (the mound of Ghani).

Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich;"Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, KG PC FRS JP (27 July 1625 – 28 May 1672) was an English military officer, politician and diplomat, who fought for the Parliamentarian army during the First English Civil War and was an MP at various times between 1645 and 1660. A loyal supporter of Oliver Cromwell, he was a member of the English Council of State from 1653 to 1659 and General at sea from 1656 to 1660. Following Cromwell's death in 1658, he switched allegiance and played an important role in the Restoration of Charles II in May 1660. Created Earl of Sandwich in July 1660, he served as Ambassador to Portugal from 1661 to 1662, then Spain from 1666 to 1668, when he negotiated the 1667 Treaty of Madrid. He commanded a naval squadron in the first part of the 1665 to 1667 Second Anglo-Dutch War, being relieved of his command in 1666 after a dispute over prize money. He returned to sea during the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War and was killed at the Battle of Solebay in June 1672. Montagu is one of the best-known characters of the 1660s since he is a central figure in the diaries of Samuel Pepys, a distant cousin and naval official.Montagu was born on 25 July 1625, only surviving son of Sir Sidney Montagu (c. 1572-1644) and his first wife Paulina Pepys (died 1638), great-aunt of Samuel Pepys. In 1642, his father remarried Anne Isham (died 1676), whom he described as "a religious, virtuous woman, as loving and contenting to me as my heart can desire".[1]On 7 November 1642, Montagu married Jemima Crew, daughter of John Crew, 1st Baron Crew and Jemima Waldegrave, whom Pepys in his Diary refers to with great affection as "My Lady". They had ten children in total, Jemima (1646–1671), Edward (1648–1688), Paulina (1649–1669), Sidney (1650–1727), Oliver (c. 1655–1689), John (c. 1655–1729), Charles (1658–1721), Anne (1660–1729) and Catherine (1661–1757).[2] Paulina's death in February 1669, aged only twenty, was a great source of grief to her father: Pepys, who called her "a peevish lady", called to pay his condolences but found him "shut away for sorrow".[3]Although his father was a Royalist, when the First English Civil War began in August 1642 Montagu followed his Parliamentarian cousin the Earl of Manchester and served under him in the Eastern Association. He raised a regiment of infantry which during the 1644 campaign fought at Marston Moor, the Siege of York and Second Newbury. Despite his family relationship, Montagu supported those in Parliament who expressed dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war by Manchester and the Earl of Essex.[4]This resulted in the creation of the New Model Army in February 1645 and the passing of the Self-denying Ordinance, requiring any of those holding military commissions to resign from Parliament. As members of the House of Lords, Manchester and Essex were automatically removed, since unlike MPs they could not resign their titles.[5] Montagu's regiment was incorporated into the New Model, taking part in the June 1645 Battle of Naseby, followed by the capture of Bristol. In October, he resigned from the army as required by the Ordinance when was appointed MP for Huntingdonshire, a seat formerly held by his father who died in September 1644.[1]Montagu played no part in the Second English Civil War and retired from Parliament after Pride's Purge in December 1648 to live quietly at home. He returned to politics in 1653 when his neighbour Oliver Cromwell nominated him to the Barebones Parliament as MP for Huntingdonshire, a seat formerly held by his father who died in September 1644.[1] He was also appointed to the English Council of State, an office he held until it was dissolved in 1659, and was re-elected to the First Protectorate Parliament in 1654, then the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656.[6]During the Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660), he was appointed joint General at Sea with Robert Blake, taking part in an expedition into the Mediterranean. This experience made him a leading advocate of establishing a British naval base in the region, an ambition realised with the acquisition of English Tangier in 1661.[7] In February 1657, he was one of the so-called "New Cromwellians" who supported the Humble Petition and Advice, inviting Cromwell to declare himself king and advocating the re-establishment of a national church. The measure was opposed by army radicals including Charles Fleetwood and John Lambert and ultimately rejected.[8]In June 1658 he commanded the naval squadron that blockaded Dunkirk and when Cromwell died in September, Montagu remained loyal to his son and appointed successor Richard Cromwell. During his brief and disastrous rule as Lord Protector, Montagu remained at sea and in early 1659 was sent to mediate between Sweden and Denmark, however, he was suspected of secret communication with the exiled Charles II and the republicans Algernon Sidney and Sir Robert Honywood were sent to monitor his activity.[9] He was recalled and investigated by the newly installed Rump Parliament, although no evidence was found, he was dismissed from command.[10]By the end of 1659, England appeared to be drifting into anarchy, with widespread demands for new elections and an end to military rule. In February 1660, George Monck, military commander in Scotland, marched into London and declared his support for the Rump against the Republican faction led by John Lambert. Montagu resumed command of the navy and was returned as MP for the important port of Dover when elections were held for a Convention Parliament in April.[11]This placed him in a powerful position during negotiations for the Restoration, when Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invited him to return to England, Montagu commanded the fleet that brought him from the Dutch Republic on 24 May.[12] Two months later, on 12 July 1660, he was created Baron Montagu of St Neots, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and Earl of Sandwich. King Charles also made him a Knight of the Garter and appointed him Master of the Great Wardrobe, Admiral of the narrow seas (the English Channel and southern North Sea), and Lieutenant Admiral to The Duke of York, Lord High Admiral of England. He carried St. Edward's staff at Charles' subsequent coronation. Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who liked and admired Sandwich, wrote that the conferring of these honours caused much resentment among those Royalists who had gone into exile with their King, and regarded Sandwich as a "diehard" Cromwellian, yet adds that his charm of manner made it almost impossible to dislike him.He was appointed Ambassador to Portugal in 1661, and strongly favoured the Portuguese marriage, through which England obtained Mumbai and Tangier. Sandwich, like others, saw a great future for Tangier as an international trade centre, and he commanded the fleet which took possession of the city in January 1662, purchasing a house there. Returning to England, in his capacity as Ambassador, he escorted the new Queen, Catherine of Braganza, from Lisbon.[13]Montagu was a signatory to The Several Declarations of The Company of Royal Adventurers of England Trading into Africa, a document published in 1667 which led to the expansion of the Royal Africa Company.[14][15][16]In the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665 to 1667 he fought at the Battle of Lowestoft, an English victory, but defeat at the Battle of Vågen led to him being removed from active service. His reputation suffered another serious blow when he failed to prevent his sailors from plundering a number of Dutch VOC prize ships, loaded with precious spices from the East Indies, which he had brought in. By long-standing custom the sailors could take any goods they found between the decks, but they were strictly forbidden to "break the bulk" i.e. ransack the ship's hold, yet this is just what Sandwich, an easy-going man with a notoriously poor understanding of money matters, permitted. When this became widely known, the rumour spread that Sandwich had unlawfully helped himself to a fortune (in fact he seems to have taken less than he was entitled to), and the public, who were still enduring the horrors of the Great Plague of London, reacted with such unexpected fury that a minor mishap became a national affair: "the Prize Goods Scandal". Although Clarendon wrote that Sandwich was too likeable to have any personal enemies, he did have political opponents, including his own superior at the Admiralty, James, Duke of York, and James' influential secretary Sir William Coventry, who were happy to exploit the scandal. He felt obliged to obtain a royal pardon: the King, mindful of his good services at the Restoration, willingly granted it.[17][18]During his absence from battle, Sandwich served as England's ambassador to Spain, replacing Sir Richard Fanshawe. This is further evidence that despite his unpopularity, he retained the King's confidence, although his political fortunes, like those of his friend and patron Clarendon, were in decline. Sandwich himself had told Pepys the previous year not to put too much reliance on the friendship of any "great man". After the Great Fire of London Sandwich downplayed the damage to the Spanish King, claiming that London's slums were the only thing in ashes. This slant on the events was also practised by England's ambassadors throughout Europe.[19]As Ambassador his most notable achievement was the Anglo-Spanish Commercial Treaty of 1667, which laid the foundations for a prosperous trading relationship between the two countries which lasted for over a century.[20] He also acted as mediator in the peace negotiations between Spain and Portugal which resulted in the Treaty of Lisbon. Like all Ambassadors of the era, he found the cost of running an embassy ruinous (he had never had a good head for business) and on his return to England in the autumn of 1668 one of his first actions was to borrow money from his cousin Samuel Pepys.[21] On his way back from Spain, he again visited Tangier to report on the condition of the garrison there.In 1670 he escorted the King's sister Henrietta of England, Duchess of Orleans, from France to England to negotiate the Secret Treaty of Dover between her brother and Louis XIV. Of the existence of the Treaty's secret clauses, notably that by which Charles II pledged to convert to the Roman Catholic faith, Sandwich, like the general public, was quite unaware.[22] In the same year he was appointed President of the Privy Council Committee on Foreign Plantations, he had always had a keen interest in international trade, despite his notorious inability to keep his own finances in order.He was subsequently reappointed to a naval command, and by 1672 at the start of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he was Vice-Admiral of the Blue with the Royal James as his flagship. At the Battle of Solebay on 28 May, his ship was attacked by a group of fire ships and was destroyed with the loss of many lives, including Sandwich himself. His body was washed ashore a week later, recognisable only from his clothing, it was unmarked and he appeared to have drowned.[10] Sandwich opposed the war and is said to have predicted his own death. Certainly, he told his friend John Evelyn, just before he sailed, that "he would see him no more".[23]On Wednesday 3 July 1672 he was buried in Westminster Abbey after a state funeral that started with a procession along the River Thames of five decorated barges from Deptford. The body was landed at Westminster at about 5 pm and carried to the Abbey in a grand procession.[24]Sandwich on his mother's side was the first cousin of John Pepys, the father of Samuel Pepys. Pepys started his career as a minor member of the Sandwich household and owed his appointments first to the Wardrobe and then as Clerk of the Acts to the Navy Board to Sandwich's influence. Pepys' diary provides a detailed primary source of Sandwich's career in the 1660s.They had a serious quarrel in 1663, when Pepys reprimanded Sandwich for living openly with his mistress, Elizabeth Becke, at her "mean house" in Chelsea.[25] Pepys was concerned at the damage to their family's reputation, Sandwich's neglect of his official duties (thus risking the loss of any remaining influence he had at Court) and also at the insult to Sandwich's wife, to whom Pepys was deeply attached. Following a brief estrangement, friendly relations were resumed, although the two men were probably never as close again as they had been (Pepys, for example, is not mentioned in Sandwich's last will). For Pepys to raise the issue at all took considerable courage, considering how much he owed to his patron, and his Diary shows that he was strongly tempted to let the matter lie. Even when he did raise it he chose to write rather than confront Sandwich face to face.In 1668 Pepys was somewhat perturbed when his wife Elizabeth, during one of the violent quarrels which followed the discovery of his affair with her companion Deb Willet, told him that Sandwich had asked her to be his mistress.[26] Since Pepys was in no doubt that she had refused, he decided to treat the matter as being closed, and friendly relations continued: Sandwich dined at their house for the first time a few months later.[27] Pepys, on reflection, may have thought it possible that Elizabeth in her anger had invented the story to upset him, (as she undoubtedly invented the story that she was attending Roman Catholic services). Whatever their differences, Pepys in later life always remembered Sandwich, whom he called "that noble and unparalleled Lord", and his wife (who died in 1674) with affection and gratitude."

Brian Charrington;"Brian Charrington  (born 1956) is an English drug trafficker and owner of a car dealership in Middlesbrough who, along with Curtis "Cocky" Warren, operated in North East England during the late-1980s and eventually built a criminal empire with links to Germany, France, Spain and Austria as well as connections in South America and the United States.Using his personal yacht, the two men sailed to France on visitor passports and, with 10-year passports, traveled to Venezuela in September 1991 where they arranged with neighboring Colombian drug cartels to smuggle large amounts of cocaine in steel boxes concealed in lead ingots into Great Britain. Although one ingot was examined in the first shipment, customs officials allowed the shipment to pass through.However, later notified by Dutch police, customs stopped a second shipment which contained 907 kg of cocaine and had Charrington, Warren and twenty-six others placed under arrest in early 1992. Despite Charrington's status as an informant for the North-East Regional Crime Squad, customs officials went forward with their prosecution despite protests from his "handlers" Harry Knaggs and Ian Weedon. Eventually, through Tory MP Tim Devlin, a meeting was arranged in which Customs was ordered to drop charges against Charrington on 28 January 1993 (several months later, Knaggs was allegedly noticed by customs officials driving a £70,000 BMW registered to Charrington) [1].Although British authorities were unable to bring him to trial in Manchester on his involvement in the smuggling of cocaine worth an estimated £150 million, Britain's security forces - who admitted he was their "supergrass" on Colombian cartels - re-homed him in Australia where his visa was revoked shortly after his arrival. Traveling to Spain, he resided at the Costa Blanca resort in Calpe and later, from a fortified villa, laundered millions of pounds which he used to bring hashish from Morocco across the border which he continued to sell.During the late-1990s, Charrington would continue to be in court when, while at Bristol Crown Court, he was acquitted of charges after it was found customs officers had illegally boarded his boat carrying 4 tons of hashish worth £80 million in 1999. Illegally re-entering the country to see his family in 2002, he was arrested by police near Exeter and placed on trial at Leeds Crown Court involving two suspended detectives and a former detective which would be dismissed when the judge refused to admit phone tap recording as evidence.Soon after his court appearance, a warrant was issued by the Bow Street Magistrates' Court for his extradition to Germany and, in July 2003, Charrington was sentenced to seven years in Frankfurt, Germany for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into Germany (phone recordings linking Charrington to a smuggling operation run by his son Brian Charrington, Jr., who served four years and three months, were used in his conviction). In January 2009, Brian Charrington was attacked by Brian Charrington Jr. and hospitalised. This created a bitter rivalry between the two and both have issued death threats.Following his release in 2006, he was extradited to France to serve a two-year prison term after 650 kilos of hashish were found in his possession on his yacht in the English Channel in 1995.In a civil suit filed by the Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) in 2004, the government agency ruled that assets seized from Charrington and Warren following their trial in 1992 had been acquired as a result of criminal activity, specifically money laundering and people trafficking.  Although both men claimed ownership of the estimated £3.6 million, each had earlier denied ownership following the seizure of the original £2.2 million from Charrington's residence in Middlesbrough by HM Customs & Excise in 1992.After Charrington's claim that the money had been earned from legitimate diamond dealing was rejected three months earlier by the High Court (who believed he had been laundering the money for Mario Halley), Warren was allowed additional time to provide evidence to back up his claim, however, his appeal was also rejected on 6 October.  Subsequently, the ARA was granted its largest Civil Recovery Order with the proceeds going towards funding government crime reduction programs.[1]In 2018 Charrington was detained by Spanish police.[2] Spanish national police recovered some 220 kilos of cocaine allegedly hidden in his luxury villa in Spain. In November 2018, Charrington was ordered to serve a 15-year prison sentence by a court in Alicante, Spain.[3]The Spanish press referred to Charrington as "el narco que escribía en Wikipedia" (English translation "the narco who wrote on Wikipedia"), because of his reputation for updating and correcting his Wikipedia entry.[2][3]"
Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA;"Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA [1995] 1 AC 190 is a judicial decision of the Privy Council relating to choice of law in tort.[1]  The  case was an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong, but as the case was decided in Hong Kong pursuant to the English Law Ordinance, section 3(1),[2] it is also taken to be an authoritative statement of English law.Bouygues SA together with nine other co-plaintiffs made a claim under a policy of insurance against Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd.  Red Sea Insurance was an insurance company incorporated in Hong Kong, but with its head office located in Saudi Arabia.  In its counterclaim Red Sea Insurance alleged that one of the co-plaintiffs, PCG, negligently supplied faulty pre-cast concrete building units, and that if it was liable at all, Red Sea Insurance would be subrogated to the claims of the other co-plaintiffs against PCG.  PCG applied to strike out that counterclaim.[1]Red Sea then amended its pleading and claimed that the proper law governing the relations between Red Sea and PCG was the law of Saudi Arabia, and that under Saudi Arabian law, Red Sea had a direct right of action against PCG.Those claims failed at first instance and in the Court of Appeal because:Red Sea appealed to the Privy Council.Lord Slynn of Hadley gave the decision of the board.After reviewing the relevant authorities Lord Slynn held that the "flexible exception" to the double actionability requirement which had been created by the House of Lords in Boys v Chaplin [1971] AC 356 could apply in favour of not only the forum (the lex fori) but also in favour of the law of the place where the tort occurred (the lex loci delicti commissi).  In this case the facts were overwhelmingly connected with Saudi Arabia, and so Saudi Arabian law only should be applied to the relevant issue.[1]Lord Slynn further held that although Boys v Chaplin was predicated on a single issue (heads of loss) being subject to the flexible exception, it was possible that an entire claim could be subject to the exception.  He stated: "The present appeal is not based on an isolated issue (as was the case in Boys v Chaplin).  The contention put forward is that the whole case be decided according to the lex loci delictii.  Although the cases may be rare where the exception should be applied the whole case, their Lordships do not consider that to apply the exception to the whole case is in principle necessarily excluded.  In their Lordship's view the exception is not limited to specific isolated issues but may apply to the whole claim".[3]In England the decision was followed by the Court of Appeal in Pearce v Ove Arup Partnership Ltd [2000] Ch 403, it has now largely been superseded by the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995.  However, it remains good law in other common law jurisdictions, and in England for claims relating to defamation.In Canada, the double actionability rule itself was reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Tolofson v Jensen [1994] 3 SCR 1022, although the Supreme Court retained the concept of a flexible exception.Similarly, in Australia the double actionability rule was abrogated by the High Court of Australia in John Pfieffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000) 203 CLR 503.  But similarly, a broad public policy style flexible exception similar to that in Red Sea Insurance v Bouygues SA was retained.[4]"

Harry Gairey;"Harry Ralph Gairey (1898 – 1993) was a Jamaican-born Black Canadian community leader and activist who worked as a railroad porter for much of his life.Gairey moved to Toronto from Cuba in 1914.[1]  He worked for the Grand Trunk Railway as a dishwasher, cook and waiter until the early 1930s, when Black waiters were laid off in the competition for remaining jobs resulting from the railway's absorption into the operations of Canadian National.[2]  In 1936, to support his young family, Gairey returned to railway work, this time for Canadian Pacific as a porter.  The poor working conditions and lack of job security led Gairey, along with other porters including Stanley G. Grizzle, to form a local chapter of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters labour union in the 1940s.  Gairey was promoted to the position of porter instructor in the late 1940s.[3]In November 1945 Gairey's teenage son, Harry Gairey Jr., was refused entry to the Icelandia indoor skating rink on racial grounds. The incident and resulting protests by students received substantial news coverage in Toronto.[4] Gairey appealed to his alderman and the city council, spurring the creation of Toronto's first anti-discrimination ordinance in 1947.[5]  Gairey argued that since military conscription was extended to all young Canadian men, regardless of race, the rights of every citizen should be the same as well.[4]Gairey's civil rights activism made him a leader in Toronto's Black community and effected change at a national level.  Inspired by the work of Marcus Garvey, he was a charter member of the Toronto branch of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and helped to form the Negro Citizenship Association to advocate for changes to Canada's discriminatory immigration laws.[6]In an obituary, Gairey was lauded for his leadership and his efforts to combat racial discrimination.[7]Harry Gairey received the Jamaican Order of Distinction in 1977 in recognition of his long service to the Caribbean communities of Toronto. [8]  He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1986 and the Order of Ontario in 1987, its inaugural year.  The outdoor skating rink in Alexandra Park, Toronto, was named in Gairey's honour in 1996.[5]"

1980 German Grand Prix;"The 1980 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring on 10 August 1980. It was the ninth round of the 1980 Formula One season. The race was the 42nd German Grand Prix and the fifth to be held at Hockenheim. The race was held over 45 laps of the 6.790 kilometres (4.219 mi) circuit for a total race distance of 305.505 kilometres (189.832 mi).[2]The race was won by Jacques Laffite driving a Ligier. Laffite won by three seconds over Carlos Reutemann driving a Williams. Third was Reutemann's teammate Alan Jones.The very high speed Hockenheimring favored more powerful turbocharged engines, and was expected to be a circuit suited to Renault.[citation needed] In qualifying, Jones managed to beat Renault driver Jean-Pierre Jabouille to the pole by four-hundredths of a second, with an average speed of 231 km/h (144 mph). They were followed by René Arnoux in the other Renault, Jones's Argentine teammate Carlos Reutemann, French driver Jacques Laffite, Brazilian Nelson Piquet (Brabham), Frenchman Didier Pironi (Ligier), and Finn Keke Rosberg in a Fittipaldi.Jean-Pierre Jabouille led early with Arnoux third behind Jones. Both Renaults suffered engine failures within a lap of each other leaving Jones to lead until he made a pitstop following a tyre puncture after the second chicane, dropping him behind Laffite and Reutemann.Laffite won the race, his first of 1980, and fourth overall. He was followed by Carlos Reutemann and Alan Jones. Nelson Piquet finished fourth in his Brabham ahead of the only Alfa Romeo entered, that of Bruno Giacomelli. Canadian Gilles Villeneuve collected just his fourth point for the year in the blighted Ferrari. In his 100th race start, West German driver Jochen Mass finished eighth in his Arrows, behind Mario Andretti (Lotus).Jones expanded his points lead over Piquet to seven. Reutemann was up to third, 15 points behind and Laffite was up to fourth, 16 points dows. The Renault drivers had faded and Ferrari drivers were completely out of the championship picture.[opinion] Williams' lead over Ligier in the Constructors' Championship was now 19 points, with the rest over 30 points behind."

Intimate Opera Company;"The Intimate Opera Company was an English opera company based in London which specialized in performances of chamber operas. Founded in 1930 by British baritone and impresario Frederick Woodhouse, the company was established with the professed aim of reviving forgotten chamber operas of the past. Most of the company's productions were produced on a smaller scale, using only piano accompaniment, costumes, minimal sets, and no props.[1]The company staged its first opera in 1930, Thomas Arne's Thomas and Sally, at a small hall in Tooting. The company later took that production, along with a dozen other operas, across the Atlantic to Broadway's Little Theatre in 1938.[2] In 1936 the company staged the world premiere of Ralph Vaughan Williams' The Poisoned Kiss at the Cambridge Arts Theatre, conducted by Cyril Rootham. In 1952 conductor and composer Antony Hopkins succeeded Woodhouse as the company's Artistic Director.[3] Under his leadership, the company presented several more new operas, including performing the world premiere of Hopkins' opera Three's Company at the Guildhall School of Music on 21 November 1953.[3] In 1963 Stephen Manton replaced Hopkins as artistic director, though Hopkins remained as a director and music adviser of the company.[4]"

USS Achigan;"USS Achigan (YT/YTB-218) was a Cahto-class large harbor tug in the service of the United States Navy. A French-Canadian rendering of the word ashigan which, in Chippewa and Algonquian dialects, is the name of the smallmouth bass.Achigan (YT-218) was laid down on 23 July 1943, at Ipswich, Massachusetts, by W. A. Robinson, Inc., reclassified a large harbor tug YTB-218 on 15 May 1944, launched on 4 October 1944, and placed in service on 9 January 1945.[2]Assigned to the 4th Naval District, Achigan spent most of her naval career at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. On the afternoon of 8 January 1946, she sank at Philadelphia, as a result of a collision with General J. C. Breckinridge (AP-176). Later salvaged, the tug returned to service at Philadelphia, in mid-1947. Achigan served there until the summer of 1956, when she was transferred to the 6th Naval District. The meager record of her service indicates that the tug served in the 6th Naval District into 1957, and was disposed of later that year.[2]"

Adolf Baeumker;"Adolf Georg Heinrich Klemens Vinzenz Baeumker  (July 14, 1891 - March 4, 1976) was a German officer.  From the 1920s to the 1950s, he was an official of various military and civil aviation research institutions.The son of a philosophy professor began his military career in the Prussian Army in 1908. After attending the military school in Glogow, Poland, he was deployed to the air force in the First World War. From 1920 to 1927 he worked for the Reichswehr Ministry, from 1924 as a consultant for technical questions of armament in the air force. In 1927 he was promoted to the rank of Rittmeister from military service and was until 1932 consultant for research and development of aviation in the Reich Ministry of Transport, from 1931 with the civil rank of a senior government councilor.Baeumker joined the Nazi party in 1933. From 1933 to 1941 he was head of the Aviation Research and Development Department at the Reichswehr Ministry, from 1938 he was ministerial director. He played a key role in the expansion and development of German aviation research institutes, founded the "Association for Aviation Research" in 1933, the "Lilienthal Society for Aviation Research" two years later, and in 1936 the "German Academy of Aviation Research". Baeumker was chancellor of this academy from 1937. On his initiative, the "Central for Scientific Reporting of Aviation Research of the General Aircraft Master (ZWB)" was founded in Berlin-Adlershof on November 1, 1933, it was not only a documentation center for specialist literature, but also played an important role in authorizing publications.The US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) monitored Europe's engine technology improvements not focusing on national security. In March 1936, John J. Ide of the NACA, reported greatly expanded aeronautical research in England, France, Italy, and Germany. In May, Charles Lindbergh reported on how Europe's progress could affect the United States. In August, George Lewis accepted an invitation to cross the Atlantic on the airship Hindenburg as guest of the Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei. Ames directed Lewis to evaluate aeronautical research in Germany and Russia.[1]  In September 1936, George Lewis visited Germany to evaluate German aeronautical facilities. Lewis discovered Dr. Adolf Baeumker's, head of government aeronautical research in Germany, large scale funding and staffing. Baeumker reported directly to Hermann Goering with almost limitless funds for aeronautical laboratories. Lewis reported on the Germans' long-range research program. German aeronautical facilities were directed to spare no expense to increase aircraft speeds.[2][1] Much of the research equipment had been modeled on the NACA's, when Baeumker first visited Goering, he had taken with him as a conversation piece a photograph of the NACA full-scale wind tunnel, and Goering decided on the spot to build one for Germany. In 1936, Lewis believed "that the equipment at Langley Field is equal to or better than the equipment in the German research laboratories." "But," he continued, "the personnel of the German research laboratories is  [sic] larger in number, and the engineers have had an opportunity of having special training, which has not been afforded to many of our own engineers."[1]  Lewis estimated that one German lab employed 1600 to 2000 persons compared with the 350 then at Langley.[1]In 1938 at the request of the United States military, Charles Lindbergh traveled to Germany to evaluate German aviation.[3]  At a dinner hosted by the US ambassador to Germany Hugh Wilson, Lindbergh was presented the Order of the German Eagle by Germany's air chief, Hermann Göring, in attendance was Anne Lindbergh, Evangeline Lindbergh, and German aviation figures: Ernst Heinkel, Adolf Baeumker, and Willy Messerschmitt.[4]Baeumker was also instrumental in the history and the emergence of the engineering school for aviation technology (IFL). In 1942 he became chairman of the Munich aviation research institute, and for the last three years of the war he had been part of the Luftwaffe's research leadership. He also did his doctorate at the University of Munich in 1944.In 1941 he became an honorary citizen of the Technical University of Munich. [1]After 1945, Baeumker worked in the United States as a consultant to the US Air Force in Baltimore and was granted American citizenship in 1954. In 1958, he was transferred to the headquarters of the American Air Force in Europe in Wiesbaden, where he worked as a consultant for German and American military command posts. From 1959 he was a member of the board of trustees of the German Society for Aviation Sciences.In 1961 he received the Great Cross of Merit.

Obiekt 292;"The Obiekt 292, or Object 292 (Объект 292), was an experimental tank of design bureau of the Kirov Plant (JSC Spetsmash) and scientists of the All-Russian Research Institute Transmash. The prototype was based on the T-80U and with its turret. The chassis was that of a T-80BV, with few modifications, but the turret of the T-80U was up-gunned to a 152.4 smoothbore gun. The new gun had the same chamber diameter as the 125mm but was much longer. Anti-tank capacity was improved in such a way that the tank could potentially engage and destroy any Western tank of the time at battle distance with a single shot.The tank was based on the T-80's chassis, using a new turret, and was armed with an LP-83 152.4 mm smoothbore gun. A variant of the tank utilizing a rifled 152mm armament was never completed. Like most Russian tanks of its time, the gun offered poor depression and slow reload despite the presence of an autoloader. The traverse rates of the barrel and turret were also lower than the regular T-80, thanks to the heavier gun. Despite being less versatile in battle, the firepower was superior to the T-80 and other similarly-armed Russian MBTs. In September 1990 the tank was completed and in 1991 underwent trials. The trials showed high stability and reliability of the gun and the tank itself. However, the absence of funding discontinued further work on the tank's improvement.A major benefit of this new design was that the new turret was interchangeable with the standard T-80 main battle tank turret. The Ammo rack consisted of only 16 152 mm rounds.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]Background: History of the tank, Tank classification, Tanks in the Cold War"
Irene Reed;"Irene Reed (Yup'ik: Iitaruaq, February 17, 1931–March 5, 2005), was an American anthropologist, linguist and educator, central in preserving and promoting the Yup'ik language in Alaska.Elma Irene Reed was born to Rev. Matt and Edna Reed on February 17, 1931, and grew up in Automba, Minnesota. She came from a large family with sisters Gladys, LaVerne, Betty Jane, Emily, and Helen and brothers Ernest, Arnold, John, Edwin, Raymond, Emil and William who died as a baby. She was educated in Kalevala Grade School and Barnum High School, finishing in 1949. She was of Finnish descent and had an interest in her Finnish roots. She graduated with a degree in anthropology in 1961 from the University of Washington, Seattle. She went on to earn a master's degree in Anthropology and Linguistics from the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) in 1972.[2][3][4]In Alaska, Reed became involved in the Yup'ik language and its preservation. She wrote the landmark Yup'ik Eskimo Grammar book and compiled the original card file for the Central Yup'ik Lexicon. As a result of this work, the first full dictionary of an Alaskan language was written. Reed was part of the creation of the first bilingual native language program for Alaskan schools and she was instrumental in founding the Eskimo language workshop in Fairbanks. She later moved the workshop to Bethel where it became the Yup'ik Language Center. Reed wrote several books and arranged for almost 200 titles to be produced in the Yup'ik Language Workshop. She was given the name "Iitaruaq" by the Yup'ik people.[5][2][6][3][7][8][9][10]Reed was the Professor of Yup'ik and became the director of UAF's Alaska Native Language Center. Reed also taught Yup'ik language and culture to students at the University of Oregon, in Honolulu, and at Monmouth College in Oregon. Through her work, Reed was a guest of the government during the Decade of the Indigenous People UN celebration. She worked extensively with Marie Meade.[2][11][12][3][10]In the summers, Reed taught written language and grammar to locals in Bristol Bay, St Mary's and Bethel. In 2003, Reed donated most of her work to the UAF Alaska Native Language Center archives. Alan Boraas, who taught anthropology at Kenai Peninsula College called it the "most significant scholarship undertaken in Alaska".[2][13][14][3] Reed became a member of the Linguistic Society of America in 1945 and a Life Member seven years later.[15]Apart from her work with the Alaskan language, Reed, with Niilo Koponen, founded the "Fairbanks Finns" organization. She also helped start "Nordic House" and arranged exchange programs with Scandinavian scholars at the UAF campus especially helping Finnish and Sámi scholars researching in Alaska.Reed lived in Fairbanks until a fall at her home in July 1996 forced her to return to Automba in 1997 where family could look after her. In Minnesota, she was a patron of the "Kalevala Theatre Society". In 1998, Reed was awarded an honorary doctorate for her work on the Alaskan language. In 2000, she was the first person honored in the Barnum High School Hall of Fame. Reed died March 5, 2005, at her home in Automba.[2][3]"
Attach rate;"The attach rate is a concept used broadly in business, especially in marketing, to represent the number of units of a secondary product/service sold as a direct or implied consequence of the sale of a primary product/service. It is often expressed as a sales ratio of primary to secondary units, or as secondary units sold as a percent of primary. The secondary good/service may be an integral component of the primary purchase (e.g., Bluetooth circuits/capabilities sold within electronic devices) or it may require a further consumer decision (e.g., as in video games sold per unit of the primary console sold). For the latter, the association between the primary and secondary may be general and loose (e.g., DVD-Video discs purchased per primary DVD player sold), or may be the result of product-specific designs (e.g., as with console-specific video games, or sales of phone-specific accessories per unit of a particular mobile phone sold).The attach rate concept is widely used as a means of reporting desirable sales associations/outcomes in the computer/video gaming industry, and in technology-related marketing in general. While complexities of real situations can obscure interpretation, attach rates often provide a metric for marketers of both primary and secondary products, allowing them to assess and even forecast the impact of the popularity of a given technology platform. Rapid sales of primary products create the market for the secondary product, conversely, the sale of platform-specific secondary products provides an indication of longer term demand for the primary platform. Real interpretive complications in technology include the general rapid evolution of both primary and secondary products, as well as factors such as changes to attach rates over a product's life cycle (e.g., because of the unrepresentative behavior of early adopters). Attach rates for products are also used more broadly in marketing, and strategically, attach rates can factor into the decision of a primary product manufacturer to merge with or acquire a secondary product manufacturer, and in the valuation of businesses in such times of times of mergers and acquisitions.The attach rate is a concept used broadly in business, especially in marketing, to represent the number of units of a secondary product or service sold as a direct or implied consequence of the sale of a primary product or service.[1] It is often expressed as a sales ratio of primary to secondary units, or as secondary units sold as a percent of primary.[2][better source needed]The good or service may rely upon a secondary consumer decision (e.g., as in console-specific video games purchased per primary console sale), or be an integral component of the primary purchase (e.g., Bluetooth circuits/capabilities shipped within primary electronic devices sold). For those requiring secondary decisions, the association between the primary and secondary may be general (e.g., the loose association between sale of one or more brands of DVD-Video discs purchased per primary DVD player sale), or may be the result of product-specific designs (e.g., the foregoing video game–console tight association, similarly with phone-specific accessories for particular mobile phones). The attach rate concept is widely used as a means of reporting desirable sales associations/outcomes in the gaming industry, though it is common in many technology-related marketing discussions. For instance, in an example related to computer or game console software, a situation may occur wherein:[citation needed]In this example, Platform A has a much higher attach rate (5 titles sold per hardware unit sold, or 5:1), versus Platform B (1 title sold per hardware unit sold, or 1:1) Hence, while in absolute terms, Platform B is outselling Platform A (by a factor of 10:1), the much higher attach rate of Platform A (5:1, vs. 1:1) has business implications. In particular, software publishers may view Platform A as the more attractive, depending on the rate of sales of each platform, because that platform only needs to sell an additional 1,000 units for their title sales to match the sales related to Platform B.[citation needed]While complexities of real situations can obscure interpretation, attach rates can provide a measure for marketers of both primary and secondary products, allowing them to assess and even forecast the impact of the popularity of a given product (e.g., of a given gaming or other technology platform). Rapid sales of primary products such as game consoles, personal computers, and cell phones create the market for a host of secondary products. Conversely, in cases where the secondary product purchase requires a further customer decision—i.e., ignoring integral examples like the Bluetooth case—the sale of platform-specific secondary products provides an indication of longer term demand for that primary platform, or related versions of that platform, to continue to support the secondary product.Real circumstances in technology and other business sectors complicate interpretation of attach rates. These complications include the rapid evolution of both primary and secondary products (e.g., the evolution of gaming platforms away from being single use devices, and of games from having only a single means of distribution). As well, factors such as changes in attach rates early in life cycle (when behavior of early adopters of technology is unrepresentative of the overall market) and late (when consumer behavior may have changed with regard to how they use the primary product) also make interpretation and forecasting of attach rates difficult.Attach rates for products can factor into the decision of a primary product manufacturer to merge with or acquire a secondary product manufacturer, and can impact the valuation of businesses in such times of times of mergers and acquisitions.[citation needed]"
Tony Haygarth;"George Anthony Haygarth (4 February 1945 – 10 March 2017)[2][3] was an English television, film and theatre actor.After leaving Marlborough College, Liverpool, Haygarth worked unsuccessfully in 1963 as a lifeguard in Torquay, and also tried escapology, equally unsuccessfully.[citation needed] Other jobs included psychiatric nursing and he was an amateur actor before turning professional and appearing in repertory theatre, followed by the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre.Haygarth played a milkman in Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads and made his film debut in the comedy film Percy (1971), from then on playing many roles in police and historical dramas, as well as situation comedies.

Paradise Glacier;"Paradise Glacier is a glacier on the southeast flank of Mount Rainier in Washington. It covers 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) and contains 0.8 billion ft3 (23 million m3) with Stevens Glacier included.[1] The glacier is bounded to the west by the Muir Snowfield, Anvil Rock and McClure Rock. There is a single extant main lobe of the glacier, ranging from 9,000 feet (2,700 m) to 7,200 feet (2,200 m), that is connected to the larger Cowlitz Glacier.[2] To the south, there was a smaller portion which was near the Cowlitz Rocks and the tiny Williwakas Glacier, ranging from 6,900 feet (2,100 m) to 6,400 ft (2,000 m) in elevation and containing the Paradise Ice Caves until the 1990s.[2][3] This smaller lobe melted between 2004 and 2006.[4] Meltwater from the glacier drains into the Cowlitz River.[1]"
Jamie Pineda;"Jamie Irene Pineda (born September 27, 1988) is an American pop singer-songwriter and former model. In late 2007, Pineda signed on to be the front woman of the international pop music project Sweetbox staying with the group until 2012.

When she was 14, she was offered a contract after an executive heard her singing on the balcony of her grandmother's restaurant. However, her family said she was much too young and they passed on the opportunity.[2] When she was 15, Jamie stood in line to audition for American Idol but was 20 days too young to compete.[2] Among her credits, she has performed at a halftime show for the Sacramento Kings game. She has stated before that some of her influences are Mariah Carey, Selena, Etta James and Alicia Keys.[2][3]After her town raised money for Pineda to move to Los Angeles, she made the move and found herself modeling for an agency to make ends meet, while trying to make it as a musician.[4] In August 2007, the agency informed Jamie about the international pop project Sweetbox looking for a new singer after the last singer, Jade Villalon, left to embark on a solo career. Taking the chance, she auditioned and impressed executive producer Heiko Schmidt. The next day, the then 18-year-old did some test recordings for Heiko in the studio of Bernd Burgdorf. She signed on soon thereafter to become the new front woman of the project.[5]The same month, Pineda got to work and began traveling around the globe to places including Stockholm, Gothenburg, New York City and London. While having songs written for her as the new face of Sweetbox, Pineda also co-wrote tracks with Toby Gad, Georgie Dennis and Derek Bramble. Seeing that they worked so well together, Bramble was chosen as the producer for the album, taking over the spot Geo left vacant after he and Jade Villalon left the project.In May 2008, Derek and Pineda got to work on the album, entitled The Next Generation. The duo recorded the album in Los Angeles, California with the help of mix engineer Rob Chiarelli, Derek's longtime partner.[6]The album's debut single, "We Can Work It Out", was released in April 2009 to Japan and reached No. 4 on iTunes Pop charts and eventually reached No. 27 of the Japan Billboard Hot 100. Two more singles, "Crash Landed" and "Everything is Nothing", were released from the album.The album was released to Japan under the Warner Music Japan label in June 2009 and in Korea under the Sony BMG label in November 2009.[7][8] Pineda promoted the album in Japan in May and June 2009 by visiting radio stations and performing at various events, including the FRESHNESS Warner event which showcased Warner Japan's hottest talent.[9][10] In July 2009 the album was released via iTunes worldwide.[11] It was the first Sweetbox release in North America since the debut album from the project in 1998.The album was well received in Japan and had success in Korea. It peaked in the top 10 on several charts for both countries, including No. 4 on the Oricon International Charts and No. 1 on several Korean charts.Pineda started writing for the second album in June 2009, right after her first album release.[7] Through the official Sweetbox website, she had been asking fans what they would like to see on the album. In September 2009, Pineda traveled to Sweden and started working with previous writers on the album. Pineda took a more hands-on role with the writing of this album and has stated she keeps a notebook with her at all times for inspiration. In a November 2009 interview, she stated that with this writing process she has a lot to write about and more emotions were coming out with the writing.[3]In January 2010, Heiko Schmidt announced that Pineda had finished writing for the album and that the second release from Pineda would be recorded in the coming months and would be released in the second quarter of 2010. He stated that the new album would feature "more uptempo and high energetic songs" than the project's previous release. In February 2010, Pineda traveled to Sweden once again and continued writing and recording. There, she once again collaborated with Didrik and Sebastian Thott, who co-wrote on Pineda's first studio album.That May it was announced via Pineda's Twitter that the album would be released in September 2010.[12]However, with lack of promotion and information the album was released on iTunes and Amazon on May 18, 2011. The cover art of the album is different from the Japanese version. The album has kept its original name Diamond Veil from the beginning of recording. The album is more upbeat and dance-oriented than the previous effort with Pineda due to that being the main criticism of the last album The Next Generation.Pineda posted two videos on Warner Japan's YouTube page talking about songs on Diamond Veil.On July 12, the deluxe version of Diamond Veil was released digitally, containing all the tracks found on the physical version. This version contains new artwork using a photo from The Next Generation as a new photo shoot was not done.After the release of Diamond Veil, Pineda left the group. While she had been somewhat open about not being pleased with how her career with Sweetbox went, it is unclear on what terms she left.Her background vocals were used for the song "Stolen" on the 2008 album I Am by the German girl group Monrose. Pineda had recorded the song while in Sweden in 2007 but the song was given to Monrose for their third album.In 2013, she auditioned to third season of the American music competition series The X Factor. She was one of Final 40 named, and one of ten finalists in the Girls category mentored by Demi Lovato, but failed to make it to the live shows.In the newly introduced "four-chair challenge" broadcast on October 2, 2013, she sang "Don't Speak", a hit from No Doubt and was put in chair as appreciation. However she failed to make it to the Final 16 (final 4 of girls) at the end of the process, when Lovato switched her preferring the performance of Ellona Santiago over hers.Pineda is married to Juan Manuel Venegas and resides in Redding, California with her two dogs, and children.AlbumsSingles"

Delaware Valley;"The Delaware Valley is a metropolitan region on the East Coast of the United States that comprises and surrounds Philadelphia, the sixth most populous city in the nation as of 2020 and 68th largest city in the world.  The toponym Delaware Valley is therefore commonly used to refer to Greater Philadelphia, the Philadelphia metropolitan area, or the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area. The Delaware Valley region includes portions of four U.S. states (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) and four regions in the area (Southeastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, northern Delaware, and the northern Eastern Shore of Maryland) along the central and lower Delaware River. The Delaware Valley has a total 2020 population of 6.245 million, making it the seventh largest metropolitan region in the United States and 35th largest metropolitan region in the world.Philadelphia is by far the largest municipality in the Delaware Valley and serves as the region's major commercial, cultural, educational, and industrial center. Other major urban population centers in the Delaware Valley include the cities of Reading,  Upper Darby Township, and Chester in Pennsylvania, Atlantic City, Camden, Vineland, and Cherry Hill in New Jersey, and Wilmington and Dover in Delaware. The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is located in the Northeastern United States and forms part of the Northeast megalopolis, the most populated region of the nation with over 50 million residents. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Philadelphia metropolitan area has a gross domestic product of $431 billion, the ninth-largest among U.S. metropolitan areas.The Delaware Valley has been influential in American history and industry. The area has hosted many people and sites significant to American culture, history, and politics. Philadelphia is sometimes known as "The Birthplace of America",[3] as both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were drafted and signed in Philadelphia. The Delaware Valley was home to many other instrumental moments in the American Revolution, and Philadelphia served as the capital of the United States for much of the 18th century. The region is home to a number of nationally known universities, including the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, one of the top universities in the world.[4][5][6] Other regional universities and colleges include Drexel University, Thomas Jefferson University, Villanova University, Saint Joseph's University, Temple University, Rutgers University–Camden, La Salle University, the University of Delaware, Stockton University, and others.[7]  Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley have become a biotechnology[8] and venture capital hub.The Delaware Valley is geographically associated and proximate to the Delaware River's main watershed, which encompass the Delaware River's two primary tributaries, the Schuylkill and Lehigh Rivers, and their respective valleys and sub-basins. These extensions also apply culturally because the ease of land travel in the region affords a great deal of daily interaction, creating a regional culture and value structure that largely blends and is parallel throughout it.In the course of their work, U.S. government agencies have reached various definitions of the Delaware Valley and the Greater Philadelphia Area.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines metropolitan statistical area (MSAs), which are regions with relatively high population densities at their cores and close economic ties throughout their respective areas. MSAs are further combined into CSAs (combined statistical areas), reflecting commuting patterns. Neither is a formal administrative division.Philadelphia is located in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes:[9]The Philadelphia-Reading-Camden Combined Statistical Area includes [9]Some counties to the north of the Philadelphia MSA and CSA, such as Hunterdon County, New Jersey, lie partly in the Delaware Valley as a geographic concept, that is, the drainage basin of the Delaware River. Local businesses and the Delaware Valley Regional High School carry the name. However, Hunterdon County does not belong to the Philadelphia CSA, but rather to the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), part of the larger New York-Newark Combined Statistical Area (CSA).[9]The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) serves all of the counties of the MSA above, except for the counties in the Wilmington, DE-MD-NJ Metropolitan Division. However the DVRPC does include, additionally, Mercer County, New Jersey, which the OMB classifies as the Trenton-Princeton, NJ MSA, part of the larger New York-Newark CSA.[10]According to 2016 estimates from the United States Census Bureau, the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area ranks as the seventh-largest MSA in the United States with 6,070,500 people.[11] According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington MSA had a gross domestic product of $431 billion, the ninth-largest among U.S. metropolitan areas.[12] 2016 Census Bureau estimates rank the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden Combined Statistical Area as the ninth-largest CSA in the United States, with 7,179,357 people.[13]The Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area's population of roughly 6 million people is comparable to that of countries such as Lebanon, Denmark, and Nicaragua. The MSA's nominal gross domestic product of $431 billion is comparable to countries such as Belgium, Iran, and Thailand. The MSA also ranks as the second most populous in the Northeastern United States after the New York metropolitan area, while the CSA is third-largest in the Northeast after the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. The Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area, which is part of Northeast Megalopolis but is considered part of the Southeastern United States under Census Bureau definitions, is also larger than the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Philadelphia itself is the sixth-most populous city in the United States and the third-most populous U.S. city east of the Mississippi River, after New York City and Chicago. Philadelphia's media market ranks fourth, behind New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, in Nielsen Media Market size rankings.[14]Educational institutions such as Delaware Valley Regional High School in Alexandria Township and Delaware Valley College in Doylestown Township are named after the region. Frenchtown's now defunct newspaper The Delaware Valley News was another example of the usage.Sixteen counties in four states constitute the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden Combined Statistical Area. The five Pennsylvania counties in the MSA are collectively known as Southeastern Pennsylvania, and the four suburban counties from this region are sometimes called the "collar counties."[15] Aside from Philadelphia, major municipalities in Southeastern Pennsylvania include the inner suburbs of Upper Darby Township and Bensalem Township. Berks County, which forms its own MSA and contains the CSA's second largest city, Reading, is generally not considered to be part of Southeastern Pennsylvania and is sometimes assigned to South Central Pennsylvania.The seven New Jersey counties in the CSA form South Jersey, although Ocean County, which is part of the New York CSA, is also sometimes considered to be part of South Jersey.[16] Atlantic County, Cape May County, and Cumberland County each form their own respective metropolitan statistical areas. Atlantic City, Cape May County, and the southern Jersey Shore (including Margate City, Ventnor City, the Wildwoods, and Sea Isle City) are major tourist destinations for people from inside and outside of the Delaware Valley. Other major municipalities in South Jersey include Cherry Hill and Camden, which is across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.The two counties of Delaware in the CSA constitute a majority of Delaware's land mass and population. Wilmington is the most populous city in Delaware and the fifth-most populous municipality in the Delaware Valley. The lone Maryland county in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden Combined Statistical Area is part of the region known as the Eastern Shore of Maryland.Although Mercer County in Central Jersey is often considered part of the Delaware Valley from a cultural perspective, it is classified as part of New York's CSA by the OMB. Mercer County and three counties in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, Carbon County, Lehigh County and Northampton County, are part of the Philadelphia media market. Caroline County, Maryland is also part of the Philadelphia media market, and other counties within the Philadelphia media market include Monroe County, Pennsylvania, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and Ocean County, New Jersey.[17]The following municipalities are all within the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden Combined Statistical Area and part of the Delaware Valley:When metropolitan areas were originally defined in 1950, most of the area now in the Delaware Valley was split between four metropolitan areas, or "standard metropolitan areas," as they were called. The Philadelphia SMA comprised Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania and Burlington, Camden and Gloucester counties in New Jersey. The Wilmington SMA comprised New Castle County in Delaware and Salem County in New Jersey, while Berks County was the Reading SMA and Atlantic County was the Atlantic City SMA.In 1960, Cecil County was added to what was now the Wilmington Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). In 1980, Cumberland County was defined as the Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton SMSA.In 1990, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton SMSAs were merged with the Trenton SMSA as the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area. At the same time, Cape May County was added to the Atlantic City SMSA.  "Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton" became obsolete one census later, with Trenton moving to the New York-Newark-Bridgeport CSA, and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Vineland CSA consisting only of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Camden MSA and the Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton MSA.[19]  Kent County became the Dover MSA in 2000, and it and Atlantic City were added to the Philadelphia CSA in 2010, for a total of six MSA components,  as a result of new 2010 definitions based on a threshold of 15% labor interchange between MSAs, two more MSAs were added to the CSA, for a total of six.  With Ocean City, NJ, and Reading, PA, the CSA is now known as Philadelphia-Reading-Camden.[20]The Delaware Valley is home to extensive populations of Irish Americans, German Americans, English Americans, Ukrainian Americans, Italian Americans, Swedish-Americans (which have a museum located at FDR Park in South Philadelphia), Polish Americans, Scottish Americans, Ulster Scot or "Scotch-Irish" Americans, Welsh Americans, Jewish Americans, Greek Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Indian Americans, Russian Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Armenian Americans, Arab Americans, Turkish Americans, Pakistani Americans, Israeli Americans, various African immigrant groups, particularly from West Africa, including Nigerian Americans, Ghanaian Americans, and Sierra Leonean Americans, as well as East African immigrants, such as Ethiopian Americans, various West Indian American groups, including Jamaican Americans and Haitian Americans, and various Hispanic American groups. Within the Hispanic population, the vast majority are Puerto Ricans, though other significant groups include Dominican Americans and Mexican Americans, as well as significant populations from Central America.[22] There is even a small Native American community known as Lenapehoking for Lenni-Lenape Indians of West Philadelphia.Philadelphia's suburbs contain a high concentration of malls, the two largest of which have at least 5,000,000 square feet (460,000 m2) of office space, and at least 600,000 square feet (56,000 m2) of retail. These are the King of Prussia mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which is the largest in the United States (leasable sq. feet of retail space), and the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which was the first enclosed mall on the East Coast. In addition, the Christiana Mall in Newark, DE is a popular destination due to its proximity to Interstate 95 and because of the availability of tax-free shopping in Delaware. Malls, office complexes, strip shopping plazas, expressways, and tract housing are common sights, and more and more continue to replace rolling countryside, farms, woods, and wetlands. However, due to strong opposition by residents and political officials, many acres of land have been preserved throughout the Delaware Valley. Older townships and large boroughs such as Cheltenham, Norristown, Jenkintown, Upper Darby and West Chester retain distinct community identities while engulfed in suburbia. The fastest-growing counties[as of?] are Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, and Gloucester. Upper Darby, in Delaware County is the largest township in the United States.[citation needed] Sometimes Reading is included in the Delaware Valley Metro Area.[citation needed]Mid-Atlantic American English and its subset, Philadelphia English, are two common dialects of American English in Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley.The Delaware Valley has four distinct seasons with ample precipitation and is divided by the 0 °C (32 °F) January isotherm. Philadelphia and the New Jersey portion of the area, almost all of the Delaware and Maryland portions, most of Delaware County and lower Bucks County, lowland southern Chester County, and some southern and lowland areas of Montgomery County have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa according to the Köppen climate classification.) The remainder of the Delaware Valley has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa.) [1] Snow amounts may vary widely year-to-year and normally do vary widely within the Delaware Valley.The region has only two ski areas: Bear Creek Mountain Resort in Longswamp Township, Berks County and Spring Mountain Adventures in central Montgomery County. Global warming endangers skiing at the latter, where the climate narrowly remains Dfa and the owners have diversified to year-round activities.Using the -3 °C January isotherm as a boundary, all of the Delaware Valley is humid subtropical except for higher portions of Berks County. The warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) only exists in higher areas of Berks where all monthly temperatures average below 22 °C. The hardiness zone in the region ranges from 6a in higher areas of Berks to 8a in parts of Atlantic City and Cape May.Using the Trewartha climate classification system, which requires eight months to average at least 50°F for the climate to be considered subtropical, the region only has seven such months, so the areas considered Cfa by Köppen are oceanic (Do) in the Trewartha system. The valley was the territory of the Susquehannock and Lenape, who are recalled in place names throughout the region. The region became part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland after the exploration of Delaware Bay in 1609. The Dutch called the Delaware River the Zuyd Rivier, or South River, and considered the lands along it banks and those of its bay to be the southern flank of its province of New Netherland. In 1638, it began to be settled by Swedes, Forest Finns, Dutch, and Walloons and became the colony of New Sweden, though this was not officially recognized by the Dutch Empire which re-asserted control in 1655. The area was taken by the English in 1664.[37]The name Delaware comes from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who had arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in 1610, just as original settlers were about to abandon it, and thus maintaining the English foothold on the North American continent. In the early 1700s, Huguenot refugees from France by way of Germany and then England began settling in the Delaware River Valley. Specifically, they left their mark in Hunterdon County, New Jersey (Frenchtown) and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.[38]Many residents commute to jobs and travel in Philadelphia, Camden, Wilmington, and the surrounding suburbs with the help of expressways, trains, and buses. There are currently no transit connections to Reading, the second largest municipality in the region.PennsylvaniaNew JerseyDelawareMarylandDelaware River BridgesMajor:Secondary:The Cape May–Lewes Ferry crosses the mouth of the Delaware Bay between Cape May County, NJ and Sussex County, DE. U.S. Route 9 uses this ferry.Listing of the professional sports teams in the Delaware ValleyThe two main newspapers are The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News, owned by the Philadelphia Media Network. Local television channels include KYW-TV 3 (CBS), WPVI 6 (ABC), WCAU 10 (NBC), WHYY-TV 12 (PBS), WPHL-TV 17 (MyNetworkTV), WTXF 29 (FOX), WPSG 57 (CW), and WPPX 61 (Ion). Radio stations serving the area include: WRTI, WIOQ, WDAS (AM), and WTEL.Philadelphia itself is heavily Democratic, having voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1936. The surrounding suburban counties are key political areas in Pennsylvania, which itself is an important swing state in federal politics.[41] South Jersey has consistently voted Democratic at the presidential level in recent years, although the region is slightly more Republican-leaning than North Jersey and has voted for Republicans at the state and local level.[42] New Castle County's Democratic lean and large share of Delaware's population has tended to make Delaware as a whole vote for Democrats, while the less populous Kent County is more competitive.[43] Recent well-known political figures from the Greater Philadelphia area include current U.S. President Joe Biden, former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell and late former U.S. Senator Arlen Specter.The following congressional districts of the United States House of Representatives are located partly or entirely in the Delaware Valley CSA. Italicized counties are not part of the CSA.Additionally, the Delaware Valley is represented in the United States Senate by the eight Senators from Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.Coordinates: 39°52′37″N 75°19′23″W﻿ / ﻿39.877°N 75.323°W﻿ / 39.877, -75.323"
Adam Maxted;"Adam Maxted (born 27 March 1992) is a Northern Irish professional wrestler and former contestant on ITV2 show Love Island. Having been a contestant on Series two of Love Island,[1] having entered at day 11,[2] Maxted paired up with Katie Salmon and finished the series in fourth position.[3]In 2016, Maxted was selected to be a part of the second series of ITV's Love Island, where he appeared from the 11th day,[2] until the end, selecting fellow contestant Katie Salmon as his date. The pair ended the series in fourth place, behind eventual winners, Nathan and Cara.[3]Maxted left Love Island and continued his wrestling training, eventually earning his debut match in August 2016, at Southside Wrestling, being defeated by Joseph Connors.[4] Maxted later had matches for Preston City Wrestling, Over the Top Wrestling, and 4 Front Wrestling, in 2017.[4] In May 2017, Maxted was called up to have his first WWE Tryout, in the O2 Arena.[5]Maxted had his first championship matches, competing for the All-Ulster Title and challenging Josh Knott for the Pro Wrestling Pride Catch Division Championship.[4] He then made trips to France, and Pakistan, where he challenged for the PWE World Heavyweight Title.[4] In November 2017, Maxted won the IPW:UK All England Championship, defeating Earl-Black Junior.[4]In 2018, after signing for 5 Star Wrestling, he appeared on FreeSports,[6] where he and Charlie Sterling won the 5* Tag Team Championship.[7]On 4 August 2018, he made his debut for World of Sport, teaming up with Nathan Cruz to take on Doug Williams and HT Drake in the WOS Tag Team Title Tournament.

Gérson's law;"In Brazilian culture, Gérson's Law (Portuguese: Lei de Gérson) is an adage which reflects the way Brazilians behave towards themselves, immortalizing concepts such as jeitinho and malandragem. In short, Gérson's Law says one should take unfair advantage out of every possible situation, having no concern for ethics. This expression came into use once a TV commercial for the cigarette brand Vila Rica, starring Brazilian footballer Gérson, was aired around 1970.[1][2] While he is a very well known football player in Brazil and worldwide, Gérson had always been a source for controversy. In the commercial, that particular cigarette brand was portrayed as advantageous for being better and cheaper in comparison to other brands, and at the end of the commercial, Gérson says "I like to get an advantage in everything. Get an advantage too, get Vila Rica".Later, the player resented having his image connected to the ad, since all kinds of unethical behaviors were linked to his name with reference to the law.[3]This article related to the culture of Brazil is a stub.

Hetmans' Party;"The Hetmans' Party (Polish: Stronnictwo hetmańskie),[1] also known as the Magnates' Party (Stronnictwo magnackie),[2] the Muscovite Party (Stronnictwo moskiewskie),[3][4] the Conservative Party (Stronnictwo konswerwatywne) and the Old-Nobility Party (Stronnictwo staroszlacheckie),[5] was a political party that opposed reforms advocated in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Patriotic Party.[3][6] The Hetmans' Party was aligned with the Russian Empire and supported preservation of the status quo and the "Golden Freedoms".[5] Its various names come from the fact that it was headed by two hetmans (commanders of Commonwealth military forces), represented the interests of conservative nobles and magnates, and was aligned with the Russian Empire.[2]By the early 17th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state—or rather, they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status (the "Golden Freedoms").[6] The peculiar parliamentary institution of the liberum veto ("free veto") since 1652 had in principle permitted any Sejm deputy to nullify all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm.[7] Thanks to this device, deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of "Golden Age", for over a century paralyzed the Commonwealth's government.[7] The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term "Polish anarchy".[8]A major opportunity for reform seemed to present itself during the "Great" or "Four-Year Sejm" of 1788–92, which opened on October 6, 1788. Events in the world now played into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars — Prussia with France, Russia and Austria with the Ottoman Empire — and with their own internal troubles to intervene forcibly in Poland. The Russian Empire had, since the beginning of the century, been increasingly involved in the Commonwealth politics, and the current situation meant it was paying significantly less attention to the Commonwealth politics. The Patriotic Party was established during the Four-Year Sejm (Great Sejm) of 1788-92 by individuals who sought reforms aimed at strengthening the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and assuring its independence from the Russian Empire.[9] The reforms, however, did not enjoy a unanimous support.The Hetmans' Party was formed to oppose the reformers. The Party's most notable members included prominent magnates such as Hetmans Franciszek Ksawery Branicki and Seweryn Rzewuski, as well as Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki and Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha.[2] They wished to preserve the status quo, as the inefficient state machinery meant that the  magnates had little, if any, responsibility to the state and were the major power wielders on their lands.[4] They hid their desire for power from the public, and sought support among the lesser, poorer nobility, portraying themselves as defenders of the traditional privileges and freedoms of the Polish nobility (the Golden Liberties) and of the Cardinal Laws.[4] The magnates were not always united, and occasionally fought one another and criticized the Russian influence, though this may have been partly a smokescreen designed to increase their support among the public.[4]The Magnates were aligned with the Russian Empire and formed two groups, one aided by Russian Ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, and the other by Grigory Potemkin.[2][4] Many of them had received financial assistance from the Russians.[10] The Russians wielded substantial influence in the Commonwealth, often by bribing Sejm (parliament) deputies, ensuring that the Commonwealth was unable to threaten Russian state interests.[7] Russia's Empress Catherine II saw the Patriotic Party's reform attempts as a threat to Russian influence in the Commonwealth, and possibly as a long-term danger to absolute monarchy in Russia itself.[11][12]After the Patriotic Party succeeded in passing the Constitution of 3 May, the hetmans and their supporters created the Targowica Confederation in defense of the traditional Golden Liberties and the cardinal laws, and called for the Russian Empire for assistance.[9][10] After the War in Defense of the Constitution, which was won by the Confederates and their Russian allies, the Hetman Party was briefly victorious, but events escalated beyond their imagining, with the Second Partition of Poland followed by the Kościuszko Uprising and the final Third Partition of Poland, ending the independent existence of the Commonwealth.Hetman Franciszek Ksawery BranickiStanisław Szczęsny PotockiHetman Seweryn RzewuskiKazimierz Nestor Sapieha"
Sandwell General Hospital;"Sandwell General Hospital is an acute teaching hospital of the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust in West Bromwich, England and provides an extensive range of general and specialist hospital services.The hospital started as an infirmary which was added to the West Bromwich union workhouse in 1884. Improvements were begun in 1925, when the infirmary then became a separate institution named Hallam Hospital.[1] After the creation of the NHS and rebuilding in the 1970s, the hospital was renamed Sandwell General Hospital.[2]A new £18m Emergency Services Centre opened on the Sandwell General Hospital campus in April 2005. This facility replaced the old A&E department destroyed by the largest fire in National Health Service history. It incorporates a comprehensive A&E facility, Emergency Assessment Unit and Cardiac Care Unit. The model of care has been developed with primary care to provide a fully integrated service.[3]Emergency coronary care was transferred from the hospital to City Hospital, Birmingham in 2015.[4]A major rebuilding project is planned involving a new 670-bed hospital with 15 operating theatres - the Midland Metropolitan University Hospital, in Smethwick.[5]Sandwell General Hospital provides a comprehensive range of medical and nursing services including general medicine, surgery, urology, plastic surgery, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, rheumatology, interventional cardiology (including percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction since 2005) and paediatrics.[6]"
Manpack Loudspeaker Version IV;"The Manpack Loudspeaker Version IV (MLX4) is a military loudspeaker. It was developed and operated by the Civil Military Operations Group (CMOG) of the Philippine Army for information support affairs operations.[1]The equipment was used by the CMOG at the Zamboanga City crisis of 2013 where it was used to broadcast to Moro National Liberation Front members the procedure for surrendering to government forces. It was also used to broadcast military songs to boost the morale of government troops in the operation.[1]The MLX4 was also used in the same year as part of the AFP's Disaster Response Operations following the onslaught of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). The equipment was used to relay messages to victims seeking to receive relief goods as well as provide moral support by playing Christmas and other inspirational songs in December of that year.[1]MLX4 front viewRear viewSide viewControl panelMLX5 Loudspeaker SystemMLX6 Loudspeaker System"

Machavariani and his mother competed together as a team at the 2015 European Games and placed 14th. In 2016 they become the first mother and son to qualify for the same Olympics.[4]"
Log-t distribution;"In probability theory, a log-t distribution or log-Student t distribution is a probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is distributed in accordance with a Student's t-distribution. If X is a random variable with a Student's t-distribution, then Y = exp(X) has a log-t distribution, likewise, if Y has a log-t distribution, then X = log(Y) has a Student's t-distribution.[1]The log-t distribution has the probability density function:where μ^{\displaystyle {\hat {\mu }}} is the location parameter of the underlying (non-standardized) Student's t-distribution, σ^{\displaystyle {\hat {\sigma }}} is the scale parameter of the underlying (non-standardized) Student's t-distribution, and ν{\displaystyle \nu } is the number of degrees of freedom of the underlying Student's t-distribution.[1]  If μ^=0{\displaystyle {\hat {\mu }}=0} and σ^=1{\displaystyle {\hat {\sigma }}=1} then the underlying distribution is the standardized Student's t-distribution.If ν=1{\displaystyle \nu =1} then the distribution is a log-Cauchy distribution.[1]  As ν{\displaystyle \nu } approaches infinity, the distribution approaches a log-normal distribution.[1][2]  Although the log-normal distribution has finite moments, for any finite degrees of freedom, the mean and variance and all higher moments of the log-t distribution are infinite or do not exist.[1]The log-t distribution is a special case of the generalized beta distribution of the second kind.[1][3][4]  The log-t distribution is an example of a compound probability distribution between the lognormal distribution and inverse gamma distribution whereby the variance parameter of the lognormal distribution is a random variable distributed according to an inverse gamma distribution.[3][5]The log-t distribution has applications in finance.[3]  For example, the distribution of stock market returns often shows fatter tails than a normal distribution, and thus tends to fit a Student's t-distribution better than a normal distribution.  While the Black-Scholes model based on the log-normal distribution is often used to price stock options, option pricing formulas based on the log-t distribution can be a preferable alternative if the returns have fat tails.[6]  The fact that the log-t distribution has infinite mean is a problem when using it to value options, but there are techniques to overcome that limitation, such as by truncating the probability density function at some arbitrary large value.[6][7][8]The log-t distribution also has applications in hydrology and in analyzing data on cancer remission.[1][9]Analogous to the log-normal distribution, multivariate forms of the log-t distribution exist.  In this case, the location parameter is replaced by a vector μ, the scale parameter is replaced by a matrix Σ.[1]"
Spenser Cohen;"Spenser Cohen is an American film screenwriter, executive producer, and director best known for his work on Extinction (2018) and Moonfall (2022).In March 2012, Cohen directed Diana DeGarmo's music video "Good Goodbye".[1] Cohen began his writing career by drafting the screenplay for Extinction.[2] In December 2013, it was revealed that the screenplay had been included in the 2013 Black List of the year's best unproduced scripts in Hollywood.[3] In 2019, Cohen was writing the script for Moonfall.[4] On February 21, 2019, Amblin Partners announced it had bought Cohen's script for the science fiction film Distant.[5] In August 2021, Cohen gained notability from writing the screenplay and story for The Expendables 4.[6] He wrote the script for the upcoming horror film Horrorscope.[7]"

Seytnafe Seytveliyev;"Seytnafe Seytveliyev (Crimean Tatar: Seyitnafe Seyitveliyev, Russian: Сейтнафе Сейтвелиев, 29 May 1919 – 13 March 1983) was a gunner in the Red Army during the Second World War and Hero of the Soviet Union. Despite taking out numerous enemy tanks and being a decorated veteran of the war, he was deported to Central Asia in 1946 because of his Crimean Tatar ethnicity.[1]Seytveliyev was born on 29 May 1919 in the Tav-Kipchak village to a Crimean Tatar peasant family. After completing secondary school he worked at a collectivized grape farm until he was drafted into the Red Army in 1939 and assigned to the Odessa military district.[1]After being drafted into the Red Army, he graduated from the junior commander's school and entered combat immediately upon the German invasion of the Soviet Union.

Julio Moreno (baseball);"Julio Moreno González (January 28, 1921 – January 2, 1987) was a Cuban-born right-handed pitcher in North American professional baseball. Nicknamed "Jiquí" (after a hardwood tree) and "the Cuban Bob Feller" for his blazing fastball, Moreno was a star in Cuban amateur baseball circles[1] before he turned professional in 1947 and his mound career would extend into 1966, when he was 45 years of age. Moreno appeared in 73 games played in Major League Baseball for the Washington Senators from 1950–1953. The native of Güines stood 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) tall and weighed 165 pounds (75 kg).After joining professional baseball, Moreno was a star hurler for the Havana Cubanos of the Class B Florida International League, winning 50 of 66 decisions (.758) from 1947 to 1950,[2] before being called up by the Senators for the final month of the 1950 campaign.In his Major League debut on September 8, he started against the Philadelphia Athletics and pitched a complete game, 10–4 victory at Griffith Stadium.[3] Moreno spent the full 1951 and 1952 seasons with Washington, as both a starter and relief pitcher, and was credited with 12 complete games and two saves during that period.

Joel Soto;"Joel Antonio Soto Torres (born in Valparaiso, Chile on 9 April 1982) is a retired Chilean footballer. He played plays as a striker and right wing. His childhood was spent in the Cerro Toro of Valparaíso then was enrolled in Santiago Wanderers at an early age. His debut as a professional was on the 1998 season.During the 1998 season, Santiago Wanderers had a team with many talented players but at that same season his team dropped to the second division of Chilean football. During the 1999 season, like the previous season, he did not have the chance to play since the time the team had a particularly good goal scoring figure in Reinaldo Navia. The following year and back in the first division he began to consider several offers for different teams and began to assert himself.In 2001, the Santiago Wanderers made several changes and Joel became stronger in front of the post holder and with much more experience, he started to become a figure alongside other players like Jaime Riveros, Moises Villarroel and Silvio Fernandez. During this season he was called to be in part of the roster for the national team sub-20 to compete in the under-20 World Cup but the bitter fact was that he and along with other teammates, was involved in an act of indiscretion, which led to his demotion to be trained with a lesser team. Once he came back with the Santiago Wanderers, he became one of the leader scores which resulted in a world championship place for his team, the first one for Santiago Wanderers in 33 years.During the 2002 season for the first time in his career he disputed an international cup, the Copa Libertadores, where his team was eliminated in the first round but achieving good results versus the current champion, Boca Juniors, a tie in Argentina and a victory in Chile were crucial for Soto.In the same 2002 season, Soto continued playing for Santiago Wanderers for the national championship and scoring more goals, rumors emerged from people linked to big national football clubs like Club América and Boca Juniors, and even a team from France. In that same year, he also achieved playing for the first time in the Copa Sudamericana where he reached the quarterfinals. Everything was achieved during this season which earned him a spot on the roster for the adult national team playing in some practice games.Finally, despite all the rumors about his departure from Santiago Wanderers nothing was finalized in particular because of the problems with the leadership and continuous playing for the love of the club, he even went into a tournament for the first time, he was elected by his peers as team captain.After so many rumors about his transfer finally in mid-2003 is transferred to Mexican soccer to Chiapas earlier in the tournament had been descended. Yet the Jaguars could not achieve a good performance, it was no longer the same as playing at Santiago Wanderers, on this table Buenos Aires wanted to have it back for the 2004 season but the economic gap could not make it succeed, and that Soto had no intentions of returning to Chilean football because it cost a lot for going abroad.Despite its low yield, their calls to the selection were not integrated and the preparation of the Selection Sub pre-23 to compete in pre-Olympic to be held in Chile.During the tournament pre Sudamerican Sub-23 in Chile, Soto wished for his return to Chile but this time not played by Santiago Wanderers, he took part in the Chile's most popular soccer club, Colo-Colo. Soto came to the club for six months on loan as a reinforcement for the Copa Libertadores in 2004 where they failed to pass through to the first round. Colo-Colo was unable to pay him well and in nine matches where only two single achievements were made before his former club, Santiago Wanderers. To this day, he is playing for Unión La Calera.After his retirement from professional soccer, he served as a sports advisor for the city of Valparaiso.[1][2]He represented Chile at under-20 level in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and was the team captain of Chile U23 in the 2004 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament.[3]At senior level, he made 5 appearances for Chile in friendly matches.[4]He is nicknamed Huevo (Egg).[3]He is the uncle of the former professional footballer José Soto, who also played for Santiago Wanderers.[5]In January 2022, he was arrested for drug trafficking in Valparaíso.[6]"
Epsilon Sigma Alpha;"Epsilon Sigma Alpha International (ΕΣΑ) is a community and collegiate service organization for anyone ages 18 and older.[4]  The organization states that its purpose "is to inspire leadership and service by bringing good people together to pursue programs and projects that make a positive difference locally, nationally and internationally."The organization's mission statement reads: "ESA is Good Friends, Good Works, and Good Times… We create activities and support causes that let us surround ourselves with welcoming, positive people who enjoy making a difference and having fun together."Established in 1929, ΕΣΑ is a network of an estimated 10,000 members in over 1,000 community based chapters, with coordinating organizations at state and international levels. ΕΣΑ also includes United States collegiate chapters which provide charitable service to their campuses and communities.  All service by ΕΣΑ members is unpaid, with membership fees covering large portions of administrative and chapter expenses.Chapters, both independently and jointly, conduct fund raising activities for charitable causes. As the care and expenses of handicapped children are a current ESA priority, the international Philanthropic Projects of Epsilon Sigma Alpha are St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Easter Seal Society.  As of July 2006, ΕΣΑ had raised over 100 million dollars for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, meeting an organization goal for their 75th anniversary. [1]  As of 2019, ΕΣΑ has helped raise more than $245 million in cash and pledges for the kids of St. Jude.  [2] ΕΣΑ has endowed the St. Jude Bone Marrow Transplant area in the hospital's Patient Care Center and the fourth floor of the ALSAC Tower.Through their efforts to raise awareness and funds, ΕΣΑ helps support Easterseals and has been a supporter of Easterseals since 1982 when they were adopted as a second International Project.  Since that date ΕΣΑ has raised over $6 million.[5]ΕΣΑ also encourages each local chapter to select and support local benevolent, charitable or civic enterprises. ΕΣΑ activities on local levels may be jointly organized with men's fraternal organizations, including the Lions Clubs International.  As a whole, the chapters have created an impressive record of service. Each year, members help raise millions of dollars for philanthropic projects and give an estimated 650,000 hours of personal service.In addition, the ΕΣΑ Foundation supports education through an ongoing Scholarship/Endowment Program and provides grants to individuals involved in charitable service for children and adults.Adelia Prichard of Oregon, a National President of Business and Professional Women's Clubs from 1923 to 1925, spearheaded the sorority's organization by proposing a national education and service sorority. In 1929, a group of community oriented women in Jacksonville, Texas drafted an organization charter.  With ten signatures, a national charter was issued to ΕΣΑ by the state of Missouri on February 11, 1930. The organization still functions under the original charter but is now incorporated in the state of Colorado.Prichard was appointed the first National Director, and spearheaded the sorority's early growth.  She asked prominent women from around the United States to serve as members of the Founder's Chapter and to act as advisors.  The chapter included Pearl Kinman, Clara Leach, Althea Terry, State President of the Business and Professional Clubs, Susan. B. Rebhan, a State Supreme Court Judge, Florence Sterling, writer and editor, Phoebe Kerrick Warner, author and National Chairman of the Rural Women's Clubs, businesswoman Florence Crawford, teacher Daisy Birchfield, and Mary Redfield Plummer, lecturer on parliamentary law at Northwestern University.  The first National Headquarters office was located in Kansas City, Missouri, with a central states divisional office in St. Louis.Director Sybil Murphy Flaherty organized the first National Convention in 1938. Two chapters in Kansas City hosted the convention with about 60 delegates attending.  At that time, delegates set up a National Advisory Council (the forerunner of the present International Council), and elected Irene Copeland Lugland of Kansas City as the first National President.During World War II, ΕΣΑ National Headquarters sponsored an “Empty Your Purse for Uncle Sam” campaign, one of the first nationally organized activities of the organization. In this door to door campaign, members collected metal for recycling into munitions.  ΕΣΑ also collected books and other reading material for distribution to soldiers around the world.  Local projects to assist the war effort were encouraged, and many chapters enrolled and sponsored Red Cross courses to combat local emergencies.In 1948, an ΕΣΑ chapter was organized in Voorsburg, in the Netherlands. The name of the National Advisory Council was then changed to the International Advisory Council.  Since then, Epsilon Sigma Alpha chapters have been organized in Germany, Guam, Denmark, Peru, Australia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Scotland.In 1988 the first collegiate chapter was formed, on the campus of Ball State University.Emblems associated with ΕΣΑ include the Greek letters Epsilon Sigma Alpha (ΕΣΑ). A national emblem is versioned, based on the needs of local and state chapters.The yellow jonquil was chosen as the organization's floral emblem as it is "rich in color, perfect in form."  A members magazine, The Jonquil, takes its name from the flower and is published twice yearly.A streamlined logo was adopted during a brand refresh, consisting of three joined circles surrounding the three English letters representing the name of the society.Epsilon Sigma Alpha has the following Collegiate Chapters[6]"
LWS-7 Mewa II;"The LWS-7 Mewa II ("Seagull") was a Polish observation and close reconnaissance aircraft, designed in the 1939 by the LWS factory as a development of the earlier LWS-3 Mewa. Aircraft development was ordered by the Polish Air Force, but no prototypes were built.In 1939, the LWS-7 Mewa II was being developed at the LWS as the development of the LWS-3 Mewa. New wings and a semi-monocoque fuselage with less drag were introduced. It was to be fitted with a more powerful 916 hp (683 kW) PZL Pegaz XX engine (Bristol Pegasus XX) or a planned 1000 hp (750 kW) PZL Waran. A maximum speed of 400–420 km/h was estimated.Before the war, only a wooden model for aerodynamics tests was made. Tests performed by Aerodynamic Institute of Warsaw University of Technology showed that the maximum speed of the LWS-7 could be estimated at 420–425 km/h - about 60 km/h more than the LWS-3 Mewa.Complete technical drawings were prepared in Summer 1939 (still not confirmed) and the first prototype was planned to be built in Autumn 1939. First flight was planned in Spring or Summer 1940 and start of production was planned for Autumn/Winter 1940. The first production LWS-7 Mewa II would be handed over to Polish Air Force in early 1941. All these plans were halted due to the outbreak of World War II.Drawings of LWS-7 were evacuated in September 1939 to the Polish embassy in Romania by the LWS director Aleksander Sipowicz. Many publications claim that they were handed over to Bulgarians, but it is not clear (possibly, it concerned the LWS-3B plans, in fact).Data from [1]General characteristicsPerformanceArmamentRelated developmentAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era"
USS Owen;"USS Owen (DD-536), was a  Fletcher-class destroyer of the United States Navy.Elias K. Owen was born on 21 November 1834, in Chicago, Illinois. In 1848, Congressman Abraham Lincoln of Springfield, took Owen to Washington and had him entered in United States Naval Academy, at the age of 14 years as a Midshipman on 7 December 1848. He graduated on 15 July 1854, was promoted to Master on 15 September 1855, Lieutenant on 16 September 1855, Lieutenant Commander on 16 July 1862 and Commander on 25 July 1866. During the Civil War he served in the Mississippi Squadron, commanding USS Louisville and a division of Admiral David Porter's squadron. After the Civil War he commanded the steam sloop Seminole in Panama, 1868–1869. He retired on 9 June 1876 and died on 8 April 1877 at Kaskaskia, Illinois.Owen (DD–536) was laid down 17 September 1942 by the Bethlehem Steel Corp., San Francisco, California, launched 21 March 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Hope Owen, and commissioned 20 September 1943.Owen, assigned to Destroyer Squadron 52 (DesRon 52), completed shakedown off California and training in Hawaii in time to join the Fast Carrier Task Force (then called TF 58, as it was then part of the 5th Fleet) for Operation Flintlock. Operating with the carriers throughout most of World War II, she escorted them to their objectives, screened them as they launched dive bombing, strafing, and torpedo attacks, and covered them as they retired.On 16 January 1944 Owen departed Pearl Harbor for the Marshalls. Between 29 January and 3 February she screened the carriers of Task Group 58.2 off Kwajalein, then retired to Majuro. From Majuro her group raided Truk 16 February and then retired briefly to Pearl Harbor, returning to Majuro in mid-March.On 22 March, the carriers, supported by battleships and cruisers and screened by a ring of destroyers, departed the atoll with Owen in the outer ring of steel. Completing strikes at Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai, 29 March – 1 April, they returned to Majuro, whence they headed for New Guinea. There they supported Army assault forces with raids on Hollandia, Wakde, Sewar and Sarmi, 21 April – 22 April and then struck at Truk, Satawan and Ponape 29 April – 1 May. Next the force hit Marcus and Wake Islands, 19 May – 23 May and then prepared for the Marianas campaign.On 6 June, the carrier force again sortied from Majuro. From 11 May through 17 May, its ships and planes ranged from the Volcanoes and Bonins to the southernmost Marianas in support of the assault on Saipan. On the 17th, after screening the carriers during strikes against Saipan, Tinian, Rota and Guam, Owen received word of a Japanese fleet en route from the Philippines. On 18 May, screening continued as she waited. On 19 May, enemy dive bombers opened the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Throughout the two day battle, which permanently crippled the Japanese sea-borne aerial arm, she carried out her protective mission in the screen of Bunker Hill.Strikes on Pagan Island preceded a brief upkeep at Eniwetok. In July, the force struck Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima, Palau, Ulithi, and Yap. During August there were further operations in the Marianas and against the Bonins. September raids against Palau, Mindanao, Leyte, Luzon and Samar in support of the Palau campaign were followed in October by a foray into the East and South China Seas. On 20 October, the force supported amphibious operations on Leyte and Samar.Owen, forced by boiler trouble to miss the China Seas operations, rejoined the force for the Leyte landings. On 25 October, Owen, temporarily with TG 34.5, sailed to assist TF 77 units which had engaged enemy forces attempting to enter Leyte Gulf. Shortly after midnight, off the eastern end of San Bernardino Strait, an enemy destroyer, Nowaki, was taken under fire. After several exchanges, Owen and Miller closed to deliver the final blows. They accomplished their mission in under 20 minutes. Nowaki was sunk with the loss of all hands and also those survivors of the Japanese cruiser Chikuma who were picked up a day before.Raids against enemy installations in the Philippines continued into November. On 25 November the force retired to Ulithi, whence it sortied, 11 December, to support amphibious operations on Mindoro. Strikes on Formosa preceded another return to the Philippines in support of amphibious landings, this time in Lingayen Gulf.Following the Luzon assault, the carrier force's sorties into the South and East China Seas were stepped up. The ships and planes repeatedly blasted installations from Saigon to the Ryukyus and frequently sailed north to raid Japan's industrial heart. On 19–21 February 1945, the force supported the assault in Iwo Jima, then steamed west again to pound the Tokyo plain. By mid-March, an intensified raiding campaign against the Ryukyus and Japan was well underway, preparing the way for an invasion force.On 19 March, an enemy dive bomber penetrated the screen to score a direct hit on Franklin Following rescue operations, Owen was detached, with others, to escort the damaged carrier back to Ulithi.Owen departed Ulithi 5 April for her last operation. For the next 53 days she screened TG 58.2 as it provided air cover for forces fighting the battle of Okinawa and raided Kyu-shu-. On 28 May, she departed the intensely disputed Okinawan combat area. Sailing south, she anchored in Leyte Gulf until 20 June, when she set a homeward course. She arrived at San Francisco, California 9 July and was there when the war ended.Assigned to the 19th Fleet (Pacific Reserve Fleet), Owen decommissioned 10 December 1946 and was berthed at San Diego. She remained there until reactivated during the Korean War. She recommissioned 17 August 1951, becoming flagship of DesDiv 282, and reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet in November. Cold weather operations in the North Atlantic in early 1952 were followed by overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard and training operations in the Caribbean.On 7 January 1953, she sailed, with her division, for the Far East. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she arrived at Sasebo, Japan, 12 February, joined the 7th Fleet, and immediately commenced operations off the embattled Korean peninsula. Owen divided her five months tour with the United Nations Force between the fast carriers (TG 77) and the Blockade and Escort Force (TF 95). With the former, her operations were similar to her World War II missions—screening and plane guard. With the latter, she patrolled from Wonsan to Chongjin and acted as flagship for the Yong Do and Wonsan Defense and Blockade Units. Defense of friendly islands, coastal patrol, shore bombardment to silence enemy batteries and impede their transport and communications activities, and mine destruction were included in these assignments.On 26 June, Owen departed Sasebo to return to NS Norfolk via the Suez Canal. Completing her round-the-world voyage 22 August, she remained on the east coast until January 1954. A 3-month Mediterranean deployment followed, after which she returned to spend the remainder of the year in the western Atlantic.In January 1955, she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet, arriving at Long Beach on 26 January. On reporting, her division was redesignated DesDiv 192. From 1955 to 1958, the destroyer alternated EastPac training operations and shipyard overhauls with WestPac tours. In December 1957, she returned from her last 7th Fleet deployment and reported for inactivation at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. She decommissioned 27 May 1958 and was again berthed in California as a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, berthed at Stockton.Owen was stricken 15 April 1973, sold 27 November 1973, and broken up for scrap.Owen earned 9 battle stars during World War II, 2 during the Korean War."

Denjoy's theorem on rotation number;"In mathematics, the Denjoy theorem gives a sufficient condition for a diffeomorphism of the circle to be topologically conjugate to a diffeomorphism of a special kind, namely an irrational rotation. Denjoy (1932) proved the theorem in the course of his topological classification of homeomorphisms of the circle. He also gave an example of a C1 diffeomorphism with an irrational rotation number that is not conjugate to a rotation.Let ƒ: S1 → S1 be an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of the circle whose rotation number θ = ρ(ƒ) is irrational. Assume that it has positive derivative ƒ ′(x) > 0 that is a continuous function with bounded variation on the interval [0,1). Then ƒ is topologically conjugate to the irrational rotation by θ. Moreover, every orbit is dense and every nontrivial interval I of the circle intersects its forward image ƒ°q(I), for some q > 0 (this means that the non-wandering set of ƒ is the whole circle).If ƒ is a C2 map, then the hypothesis on the derivative holds, however, for any irrational rotation number Denjoy constructed an example showing that this condition cannot be relaxed to C1, continuous differentiability of ƒ.Vladimir Arnold showed that the conjugating map need not be smooth, even for an analytic diffeomorphism of the circle. Later Michel Herman proved that nonetheless, the conjugating map of an analytic diffeomorphism is itself analytic for "most" rotation numbers, forming a set of full Lebesgue measure, namely, for those that are badly approximable by rational numbers. His results are even more general and specify differentiability class of the conjugating map for Cr diffeomorphisms with any r ≥ 3."
Gayoe;"The Gayoe, also known as the kuda-Gayo, is a pony from the island of Sumatra, found near Aceh.[1] The name is derived from the Gayoe hills in the north of the island.[2]The Gayoe is one of eight breeds native to Indonesia, the others are the Batak Pony, Deli pony, Bali Pony, Java Pony, Sumba and Sumbawa Pony (and closely related Sandalwood Pony) and Timor Pony.[3]Gayoe ponies are generally solid-colored, usually a dark bay shade commonly called "brown". Adults are approximately 12.2 hands (114 cm) tall at the withers, and small-bodied.[1]They are primarily used for transportation on Sumatra, and the 1997 FAO Breed Survey indicated that the breed has a stable population of about 7500 animals, thus it is not endangered.[1]Horses were introduced to Nusantara archipelago in unknown date, they are descended from Tibetan or Mongol-type horses.[4]: 39  It is possible that ancient stocks were brought to Indonesia by the Chinese Tang dynasty in the 7th century, recorded as being given to Dja-va (Kalingga kingdom), Dva-ha-la, and Dva-pa-tan (Bali). Mongolian horses are probably captured during the Mongol invasion of Java (1293). If this true, the Nusantaran ponies would owe much of its roots to the Mongolian horse as well as horses obtained from other areas of western Asia like India and Turkmenistan.[5]: 14 [6]: 60 [7]This horse breed–related article is a stub.

University of Chichester;"The University of Chichester is a public university located in West Sussex, England, which became a university in 2005. Campuses are based in the city of Chichester and the nearby coastal resort of Bognor Regis and an associate campus for commercial music on the Isle of Wight.[5]The University of Chichester has 14 departments, with specialisms including Humanities, Sport, Musical Theatre and Education. Its heritage stretches back into the nineteenth century when, in 1839, Bishop Otter College was established. Since 2013, both campuses have seen major expansion-led building works through National Lottery funding and other funding.The University of Chichester is a member of The Cathedrals Group.[6]In 1840, a school for training 'Masters' was founded by William Otter, Bishop of Chichester, which was rebuilt in his memory as the Bishop Otter College in 1849.[7] The original buildings, created in a neo-Tudor style, were designed by the architect J. Butler.[8]In 1873, the campus became a training institute for women teachers due to the activism of Louisa Hubbard after the Elementary Education Act 1870 which created demand for school teachers.[9] Men were admitted to the college in 1957.[10]In the 20th century the campus was gradually expanded to meet demand. There was a large extension in the 1960s, including a steep gabled cruciform chapel, designed by the architect, Peter Shepheard.[8]During the 1970s the Principal of Bishop Otter College was Gordon McGregor, who went on to be Principal of Ripon and York St John and latterly Emeritus Professor of Education at the University of Leeds.At Bognor Regis a teacher training college was founded in the 1940s to support the expansion of education.In 1977 Bishop Otter College and the Bognor Regis college were merged to form the West Sussex Institute of Higher Education (WSIHE), with degrees being awarded by CNAA and later the University of Southampton.  Alumni from this period include the actor Jason Merrells and the author Paula Byrne. Between 1995 and 1999, it was known as Chichester Institute of Higher Education. It gained degree-awarding powers in 1999, becoming  known as University College Chichester, and became recognised as a full university in October 2005.In 2015 Chichester University secured government and lotteries commission funding to the value of approximately £8millions and embarked on a plan of expansions at both academic sites, involving the demolition of several smaller collegiate structures, that were no longer suitable for purpose and the construction of facilities for academia, administration and sports.In January 2017 the multi-million pound purpose built Academic Block was opened, hosting lecture and seminar rooms, a brand new Students' Union shop and a sprung floor dance space.[11]The main campus (Bishop Otter) is situated at College Lane, Chichester and is set in surroundings which include historic buildings and modern facilities. It is a five-minute walk from Chichester city centre. Chichester Festival Theatre is adjacent to the campus.In 2016, the Chichester campus underwent redevelopment with a new Academic Building for teaching. Other work included construction of a sports dome, chapel extension, courtyard, Sports Hall and Gym refurbishment, as well as major development work on the Library or Learning Resources Centre (LRC) which has three floors.The Otter Gallery was located within the LRC. It offered public art exhibitions and workshops throughout the year. It was permanently closed against public protest at the end of 2018.[12]The Bognor Regis campus is in a leafy environment five minutes from the sea, and has three mansion houses with Georgian architecture: St Michael's, the Dome and Mordington House.The Bognor Regis campus is close to Hotham Park., The park surrounds Hotham House, built in 1792 by Sir Richard Hotham.[13] Also nearby is the Ice House – the original 18th Century refrigerator of Hotham Park Estate.[14]The university's £35million[15] Tech Park was opened on Wednesday 3 October 2018 by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.[16]The university department structure can be found below.[17]"

Bonita Beach Causeway;"The Bonita Beach Causeway is a series of four low-level bridges located in Southwest Florida traversing the barrier islands of Estero Bay connecting the town of Fort Myers Beach with Bonita Springs. It carries Estero Boulevard (County Road 865) and is four miles (6.4 km) long from end to end. Each bridge on the Bonita Beach Causeway is named after the body of water it crosses.Estero Boulevard (which crosses the causeway) begins just south of the Bonita Beach Causeway on Little Hickory Island, splitting off from Hickory Boulevard (County Road 865). It heads north and crosses Big Hickory Pass Bridge, which lands on Big Hickory Island. After a short distance, it then crosses the New Pass Bridge, and lands on Long Key, and enters the Lovers Key / Carl E. Johnson State Park. After crossing the Little Carlos Pass Bridge onto Black Key, Estero Boulevard turns west and crosses the Big Carlos Pass Bridge, a small single-leaf drawbridge, onto Estero Island, and the town of Fort Myers Beach.Before the causeway's construction, the only way to access Estero Island and Fort Myers Beach by car was via the Matanzas Pass Bridge (which was still a small swing bridge at this time). The swing bridge's machinery was highly unreliable, which concerned islanders who feared the bridge would break down in the event of an emergency, such as a hurricane evacuation. The islanders felt having a second exit for the island for safety reasons would be wise.The county then decided the most feasible location was to run the causeway from the south end of the island over barrier islands to Bonita Springs.  The causeway's exact routing was selected by surveyor Carl Johnson (for whom Lovers Key / Carl E. Johnson State Park was named), and he became known as the father of the project. Construction began in 1963, and the causeway opened on July 4, 1965.[1]Big Hickory Pass BridgeNew Pass BridgeThe entrance to the Lovers Key / Carl E.

He won the 1890 Kentucky Derby for owner and trainer Edward Corrigan who shortly after would build Hawthorne Race Course which opened in Cicero, Illinois in 1891.[1] Ridden by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Isaac Murphy, Riley won the mile and one-quarter Derby in  2 minutes 45 seconds, the slowest time recorded to that point due to a very muddy track.[2] Riley was originally named Shortfellow[3] and had a relatively long and successful career in which he had 64 starts with 30 wins, 17 places, and 4 shows.Riley died on July 1, 1910 at the age of 23 while being cared for by a racehorse rescue association.[4]Riley's only offspring of note was his daughter, Hurley Burley, who was the dam of Burgomaster, a successful sire.[5]186718531855188018591869Legend – ₩ = Triple Crown winners, ♥ = Filly"
Dana Wright;"Dana Wright (born September 20, 1959) is a Canadian former track and field athlete who competed in the 400 metres hurdles. She had personal bests of 57.35 seconds for the hurdles and 53.14 for the 400 metres sprint.Born in Toronto, Ontario, she attended Old Dominion University.[1] She placed third in the 400 m hurdles at the Canadian Athletics Championships in 1982, 1984 and 1985, with her best finish at the national level coming in 1987, when she was runner-up to Gwen Wall.[2]She gained selection for both the hurdles and as the alternate heats runner for the Canadian 4×400 metres relay at the 1984 Olympic Games. She was eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the hurdles but helped the relay team into the final of the competition. Molly Killingbeck replaced her in the final and Canada won the silver medal in Wright's absence. She was a hurdles finalist at the 1987 Pan American Games (coming seventh) but this was her final international appearance and she retired from the sport soon after.[1]"
W. D. Ariyasinghe;"Widanelage Dharmaratna Ariyasinghe, (16 March 1956 – 9 November 2020, Sinhala: ඩබ්. ඩී. ආරියසිංහ), popularly as W. D. Ariyasinghe, was a Sri Lankan singer, musician and a composer.[1][2]He was born on 16 March 1956 in Kandy, Sri Lanka as the fifth child in the family with eight. He completed education from Pilimathalawa Central College. Later, he graduated with Bachelor of Fine Arts from University of the Visual and Performing Arts.[3]He was married to fellow musician Darshani Chandrasena after a long-standing relationship since university period. Darshani is the youngest daughter of the musician late R. A. Chandrasena. She was graduated with Fine Arts degree in 1983 before Ariyasinghe and worked as visiting lecturer at the university for three years.[4] The couple has two sons, Harshadewa and Pulasthi.[3] His son Harshadewa is also a singer.[5]After undergoing a hip surgery due to an accident some time ago, his health was improving and he was advised by the doctor to rest for about three months.[6] However, he died on 9 November 2020 at the age of 64 after a prolonged illness.[7]During university period, he studied music under the maestro W. D. Amaradeva. After the graduation in 1988, he worked as a music teacher at Sarasavipaya (adjacent to Elphinstone Theatre) with his wife Darshani. Later they managed the popular "R. A Chandrasna Music Institute" which was founded by his father-in-law R A Chandrasena.[8] He met the musician and composer Premasiri Khemadasa who invited Ariyasinghe to sing a collection of popular songs that Khemadasa has composed along with Ajantha Ranasinghe that Amaradeva had sung originally.[5] The songs were recorded on the album called 'Prema Sandevo'. He was later criticized for being a copycat of Amaradeva.[9] During this period, he became a 'Grade A' singer at the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) and recorded over 1,000 songs at SLBC.[3]In 1986, he got his first appointment as a music teacher at Bandaranayake Central College, Uduwela, Barawardhanaoya. In 1991, he got appointed to D. S. Senanayake College, Colombo 7 as a Music Teacher where he served for 15 continuous years. Later, he left the teaching profession and became a full-time musician. He sang several popular songs such as Ma Langatama Thawa Lan Wela, Thisara Thudata and Walakulu Pelin Basinna and also voiced jingles of several popular TV advertisements.[9][10][11] Ma Lagatama Thawa Lanwela composed by Tissasiri Perera and written by Ajantha Ranasinghe became one of the most popular songs.[5]"

Non liquet;"In law, a non liquet (commonly known as "lacuna in the law") is any situation where there is no applicable law.  Non liquet translates into English from Latin as "it is not clear".[1] According to Cicero, the term was applied during the Roman Republic to a verdict of "not proven" where the guilt or innocence of the accused was "not clear".[2] Strictly, a finding of non liquet could result in a decision that the matter will always remain non-justiciable, whereas a lacuna denotes within that concept a lacking hence that the matter should in future be governed by law.Loopholes are a subset of lacunae. A lacuna describes every specific matter about which no law exists, but a body of public, judicial or academic opinion believes it should, to address a particular issue (often described as "unregulated" or "wholly inadequately regulated" activities or areas).  A loophole, where properly defined by contrast, denotes that a set of laws addressing a certain issue exists, but can be circumvented (or is being exploited) due to a technical defect in that law.Related legal interpretative rules include the:In short, the wording will be interpreted if dictionaries and grammar allow so as to plug the gaps in the law as the state instrument (or ruling) intended.All cases which establish a new rule or exception fill lacunae in the existing law.  If in a higher court in the jurisdiction, each of these are decisions thereafter considered to be a binding precedent, in England and Wales if in the various divisions of the High Court or below then these are of persuasive precedent value.[3]Moral principles and norms are broader than the intended reach of any system of laws (jurisdiction) which permits human autonomy and diversity of thinking or action. “It would not be correct to say that every moral obligation involves a legal duty, but every legal duty is founded on a moral obligation.”[4]If this one-to-one relationship is accepted, this defines a definitive master set from which the subset, true legal lacunae (as opposed to semantic omissions) are all contained.A non liquet applies to facts with no answer from the governing system of law. It is prominent in international law as global forums such as the International Court of Justice and United Nations ad hoc tribunals are reluctant to invent or heavily mould law to redress a moral-legal lacuna. One last resort in substantively deciding disputes is to seek the system to embrace accepted (lowest common denominator) procedural or non-controversial law of civilized nations. An instance is the Case Concerning Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Company, Ltd which took the doctrine of estoppel into international law. Such out of constrained confines (ex aequo et bono) jurisdiction has been heavily limited or ruled out by most treaty contracting parties as to their substantive obligations. Rather than use the term non-justiciable, the forum may flag up that it would like the clarity to decide on such matters in future by stating it is non liquet. Luhmann criticises such indecision as opposed to the paradigm of law being a complete (and autonomous) system.[5] English jurisprudence holds that municipal courts enforcing international law are not constrained to declare an area non liquet.[6]"
Jarvis Johnson;"Jarvis Diallo Johnson (born September 27, 1971) is an elected official currently holding office as a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives. He has represented the 139th District since 2016.Johnson succeeded Sylvester Turner, who stepped down to serve as Mayor of Houston. He is a former District B District Council Member that served the term limit, three terms, in the city of Houston, Texas.Johnson grew up in Houston's Fifth Ward. During his early teens, he and his sister Velika became two of the founding members of the Mickey Leland Youth Task Forces (MLYTF).[citation needed]Johnson graduated with a B.A. from  Texas Southern University. While in college, he became executive director of Phoenix Outreach Youth Center in 1995. Johnson resigned this position in 2008 to focus his efforts on District B as a full-time city council member.Johnson is the owner of Aunt Bea's Restaurant, co-owner of two daycares in Houston, and president of Commagere International Consultant Group.In 2005, Johnson ran for Houston City Council District B, a seat held by term limited Carol M. Galloway. In an eight candidate race, Johnson received nearly 4,000 votes, earning a spot in the December run off election. In December 2005, Johnson won the Houston City Council District B race by over 60% of the vote. He was subsequently re-elected to a second and third term.Johnson served as chair of the City of Houston's Human Services and Technology Access Committee. Johnson also served on the Houston City Council Flooding and Drainage, Housing and Community Development, International Liaison and Protocol, M/WBE, Small Contractor Development and Contract Compliance, Pension Review, Public Safety and Homeland Security, Regulation, Development, Neighborhood Protection and Transportation, Infrastructure & Aviation committees.On January 5, 2010, Johnson announced his candidacy for Texas's 18th Congressional District seat, a seat held by incumbent Sheila Jackson Lee.[1]Jackson Lee was in her third term on the Houston City Council in 1994 when she beat incumbent U.S. Representative Craig Washington on the theme that he was out of touch with his district. When Johnson announced his candidacy in 2010, he had just won a third term to a council seat within the 18th Congressional District. The congressional district encompasses much of urban Houston and is about 40% black with the remainder split between whites and Hispanics. It accounts for about a quarter of the city's more than 2 million residents.[2]Johnson ran in the 2016 primary election, advanced to the runoff election, and won a special election called to determine an interim representative for 2016 and won the primary election runoff. Since he was unopposed in November 2016, Johnson winning the special election and runoff meant he was the District 139 state representative who would succeed Sylvester Turner. After 26 years, Turner stepped down from his state seat to become Houston's mayor.Johnson won the May 7 special election, with 85% of the vote, to finish out the remainder of Turner's term as state representative of District 139. Turner swore him in,[3] allowing Johnson to serve through December and immediately, fully assume former Turner's seniority status and his roles that include vice-chairman of the House Appropriations Committee."

Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine;"The Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine is given each year to a periodical publication related to science fiction or fantasy that meets several criteria having to do with the number of issues published and who, if anyone, receives payment.[1] The award was first presented in 1984, and has been given annually since, though the qualifying criteria have changed. Awards were once also given out for professional magazines in the professional magazine category, and are still awarded for fan magazines in the fanzine category.In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.[2] To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954, but for each of those years, the Semiprozine category failed to receive enough nominating votes to form a ballot.[3]At the 2008 business meeting, an amendment to the World Science Fiction Society's Constitution was passed that would have removed the Semiprozine category. The vote to ratify this amendment was held the following year, the ratification failed and the category remained. Instead, a committee was formed to recommend improvements to the category and related categories.[4]During the 39 nomination years, 39 magazines have been nominated. Of these, only 9 magazines run by 31 editors have won. Locus won 22 times and was nominated every year until a rules change in 2012 made it ineligible for the category. Uncanny Magazine has won 6 times out of 7 nominations, including 5 times in a row in 2016–2020, while Science Fiction Chronicle, Clarkesworld Magazine, and Lightspeed are the only other magazines to win more than once, with 2 awards out of 18 nominations, 3 out of 4, and 2 out of 5, respectively. Ansible has won 1 out of 7 nominations, Interzone has won 1 out of 28, and Weird Tales and FIYAH Magazine of Black Speculative Fiction have each won 1 out of 4 nominations. As editor of Locus Charles N. Brown won 21 of 27 nominations, though he shared 5 of those awards with Kirsten Gong-Wong, 3 with Liza Groen Trombi and 2 with Jennifer A. Hall, as Locus editor Liza Groen Trombi won 1 shared with Kirsten Gong-Wong. Uncanny's awards were primarily earned by a team of 5 people, Lynne M. Thomas, Michael Damian Thomas, Michi Trota, Erika Ensign, and Steven Schapansky. The sole editor for Chronicle's awards was Andrew I. Porter, while David Pringle earned Interzone's, and Ann VanderMeer and Stephen H. Segal were the editors for Weird Tales's victory. Lightspeed's wins were under John Joseph Adams, Rich Horton, and Stefan Rudnicki, with Wendy N. Wagner and Christie Yant added for the second win, while David Langford was the editor when Ansible was awarded. Clarkesworld Magazine's winning years were under Neil Clarke, Sean Wallace, and Kate Baker, with 2 of the three also under Cheryl Morgan and the other under Jason Heller. FIYAH's win was under Troy L. Wiggins, DaVaun Sanders, Eboni Dunbar, Brandon O'Brien, Brent Lambert, and L. D. Lewis. The New York Review of Science Fiction has received the most number of nominations without ever winning at 22, under the helm of David G. Hartwell, Kathryn Cramer, Kevin J. Maroney, and 8 other editors.Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon). The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting among six nominees, or more in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the ones nominated by members that year, ranked according to a complex algorithm, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1953 through 1956 and 1958 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1959 all six candidates were recorded.[2] Initial nominations are made by members in the first months of each year, while voters vote on the ballot of six nominations in the middle of the year, with exact timing varying from year to year.[5] Prior to 2017, the final ballot consisted of five works, it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.[6][7]In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each date links to the "year in literature" article corresponding with when the work was eligible.

Burnie Airport;"Burnie Airport (IATA: BWT, ICAO: YWYY), also called Burnie Wynyard Airport or Wynyard Airport, is a regional airport located adjacent to the town of Wynyard, about 17 kilometres (11 mi) west from Burnie, Tasmania, Australia. Formally named the Wynyard Aerodrome, the first official opening occurred on 26 February 1934. The Burnie Airport is majority owned by the Burnie City Council.Rex Airlines operates services to and from Melbourne about 4 times per day using Saab 340 turboprop aircraft. Sharp Airlines offers flights to King Island and Launceston twice per day using a 19-seat Metro 23 (SA-227) turboprop aircraft. From 17 September 2021, QantasLink will launch direct seven weekly flights to Melbourne for the first time in 15 years with its 50-seat Q300 turboprop aircraft.The first aerodrome at Wynyard was built by volunteers on an old racecourse. However, within a year of completion in 1932, the aerodrome was found to be too small for larger passenger and mail aircraft. A larger aerodrome was developed on the southern outskirts of the town and was officially opened on 26 February 1934.[1][5] A further opening ceremony on 1 January 1935 was attended by the Prime Minister of the time, Joseph Lyons.[6]In the mid-1970s, Federal policy was adopted that would eventually see the ownership and maintenance of all airports outside of capital cities transferred from the Commonwealth to the respective local authorities.[1][7] Under the new scheme, the future of the Wynyard Aerodrome was cast into doubt after Federal funding was secured for upgrading the Devonport Airport in August 1980, few if any areas of regional Australia had two major commuter and cargo airports only 60 km apart, which was the situation for Burnie/Wynyard and Devonport. After much political controversy, it wasn't until March 1985 that AU$5.2 million of funding was allocated by the State and Federal governments to upgrade the Wynyard aerodrome.[1]The upgraded aerodrome was officially opened on 15 February 1987, incorporating a sealed runway 1650m long. Ownership had been transferred from the Commonwealth to the Burnie Port Authority and the Wynyard Aerodrome was renamed to Burnie Airport. The airport's IATA code (the three-letter code appearing on luggage tags etc) was changed from WNY to BWT.[1][8]The Burnie Airport Corporation Unit Trust acquired the Burnie Airport from the Burnie Port Corporation in 2001. The Trust is 51% owned by the Burnie City Council and 49% owned by a private sector partner, the Australian Airports Association.[9]As early as 1933, Tasmanian Aerial Services was landing at Wynyard as part of a route from Western Junction (now Launceston Airport) to Latrobe (Devonport Airport was yet to be built), Smithton and King Island.[10] T.A.S was the forerunner of Holyman Airways, which then became Australian National Airways (ANA). As was the case with many Australian airports, services to/from Wynyard during the Second World War were sporadic and limited to essential travel in support of the war effort. ANA resumed services between Melbourne's Essendon Aerodrome and Wynyard in January 1946, while the infant Trans Australia Airlines (TAA) received Commonwealth approval to commence services to Wynyard in November 1947. Both airlines operated Douglas DC-3 aircraft into Wynyard for most of the next decade, with occasional visits by DC-4 and Convair aircraft as they were displaced off the main capital city trunk routes by the arrival of more modern fleets of Douglas DC-6 and Vickers Viscounts. The only major change during this period came about through the takeover of Australian National Airways by Ansett in November 1957, forming Ansett-ANA.Wynyard was one of the first regional airports to see service from the Fokker F27 Friendship, when both TAA and Ansett-ANA began receiving their new aircraft in 1959. The Friendship became the mainstay of both airlines' services to Wynyard and neighbouring Devonport during the 1960s, while Viscounts were also regular visitors as they moved onto regional routes following the delivery of Lockheed Electras, Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-9s for both airlines. In 1964, TAA began operating an internal 'supplemental' route between Hobart, Devonport, Wynyard and Smithton. The DC-3s initially used on the route proved too large, and these were replaced by eight-seat Beechcraft Queen Airs. This was the start of increasing moves by the major carriers to use 'light' aircraft on services within the states where the DC-3 and F27 proved too large.By the 1970s, the Two Airline Policy which regulated the operations of the major airlines had been in place for decades. The practical effect of this policy obligated both airlines to operate a route with similar aircraft providing similar capacity, departing at similar times and charging identical fares. By this time, a large fleet of Ansett and TAA Fokker F27s was providing regional services in every state of Australia, alongside associated Ansett carriers such as Airlines of NSW, Airlines of South Australia and Western Australia's MacRobertson Miller Airlines (MMA). The Tamworth-based East-West Airlines also had a growing fleet of F27s and ambitions to expand beyond its network of routes connecting NSW country centres with Sydney.As the 1980s dawned, Ansett and TAA were incurring heavy losses on many of their regional routes. A downturn in passenger traffic caused by an economic recession resulted in both carriers reviewing their networks. As the government-owned carrier, TAA faced political pressure from the conservative Fraser Liberal Government to control its costs, with some government members in favour of privatising the airline. TAA already co-operated with East-West Airlines, with passengers on TAA's capital city network interchanging onto regional routes operated by East-West (and vice versa). This was necessary for both airlines to compete against Ansett, which owned its own regional subsidiaries. By 1981, TAA had decided to withdraw its Fokker F27s from service and proceeded to formalise agreements with smaller carriers to take over those routes. This saw East-West's own fleet of F27s assume the services from Melbourne to Wynyard and Devonport during February 1982, competing against Ansett.The future of Burnie Airport was under the microscope by the mid-1980s, as noted above. Devonport's upgrade to jet standard had been completed by 1983, and both East-West and Ansett (through subsidiary Air NSW) were operating Fokker F28 Fellowship twinjets to Sydney, and a mixture of F28s and F27s to Melbourne. The introduction of jets (and the route to Sydney) from Devonport caused Wynyard's passenger numbers to decline and the viability of both airlines servicing both airports was questioned. Wynyard's existing main runway 08/26 was too short for F28 operations, and was unable to be extended due to roads and sports fields at the western boundary and a residential area to the east. With the new jet-standard runway 09/27 constructed to the south of the existing runway, the airlines were placed under political pressure to upgrade their equipment from the F27 in order to justify the cost of construction. Ansett responded by scheduling an Air NSW F28 to operate the breakfast flight to Melbourne on two days a week, with the balance to still be operated by F27s. Also during 1987, a series of sales and takeovers resulted in East-West being bought by Ansett's parent company Ansett Transport Industries (ATI), and it became clear that both Burnie and Devonport Airports would be subject to some level of service rationalisation. ATI opted to make East-West the primary operator from Devonport, while the number of Ansett services would be reduced. At Wynyard, East-West services would be withdrawn by February 1988 with Ansett to remain as the sole operator. Around this time Ansett also announced that it was withdrawing the twice-weekly F28 service to Melbourne, and F27s would resume operating all services ahead of the imminent delivery of new Fokker F50 turboprops. VH-MMO had the distinction of operating the last Ansett Fokker F27 Friendship flight from Tasmania when it operated flight AN856 Wynyard-Melbourne on 22 July 1988.1989 was to be a year of major change for Burnie Airport. Ansett's Fokker F50 service began to be disrupted as a result of industrial action by domestic airline pilots, culminating in the mass resignation on August 24 of pilots working for the major carriers Ansett, East-West and Australian Airlines, along with air-freight provider Ipec. This threw domestic travel into chaos and saw numerous airports, including Wynyard, lose most of their services overnight. Commuter airlines stepped into the breach as best they could (see below), while Ansett was able to use its subsidiary company Kendell Airlines to temporarily operate between Melbourne, Wynyard and Devonport using a mixture of Saab 340 and Fairchild Metroliners. Kendell pilots were not members of the same union as those working for Ansett and East-West, and thus they were unaffected by the industrial action. The return of small numbers of Ansett pilots allowed limited Fokker 50 services to resume to Wynyard, but ATI announced that Ansett was withdrawing from Burnie in order for Kendell Airlines to take over operations on a permanent basis using the Saab 340. Kendell was the sole operator connecting Burnie and Melbourne Tullamarine for the first half of the 1990s, before competition returned to the route in 1995 with the introduction of services by the Qantas regional affiliate Southern Australia Airlines using DeHavilland Canada Dash 8-100 aircraft.Competition between the two airlines was disrupted by the collapse of Ansett Australia when the airline and its associated companies (including Kendell Airlines) ceased flying in the early hours of 14 September 2001. Kendell resumed limited services later in the month, with flights being temporarily routed via King Island. In August 2002, Kendell became part of the newly-formed Regional Express Airlines (Rex) and resumed flying at frequencies similar to those previously operated by Kendell, continuing to use the Saab 340. Qantaslink (by this time the umbrella brand for Qantas Group regional airlines) announced it would withdraw from the Burnie to Melbourne route in July 2006. This has left Regional Express as the sole operator in the period since. Qantaslink had announced intentions to resume the route effective from June 2021 but opted to defer until September, citing a downturn in demand due to ongoing COVID-19 travel restrictions between Tasmania and Victoria. The outbreak of COVID in 2020 caused Regional Express to dramatically reduce the frequency of services to Burnie in line with the general downturn in air travel experienced elsewhere, and services that did operate usually did so via King Island.Numerous third-level carriers have also operated services to Burnie/Wynyard, with varying degrees of success. Aerial Services (Tasmania) was the first, established in 1968 to take over the intra-state routes TAA commenced operating with Queen Airs in 1964. This airline would be re-named Air Tasmania in 1973, with an ex-Ansett Douglas DC-3 as the main equipment. By 1980, Air Tasmania was using a mixture of Piper Navajo, Cessna Navajo and Embraer Bandierante aircraft on routes connecting Wynyard with King Island, Smithton, Devonport and Hobart. They were joined by Executive Airlines on the direct King Island to Wynyard route using aircraft including Aero Commanders and the GAF N22 Nomad. H.C Sleigh Airlines also operated a network of routes based out of Launceston which included Wynyard and used a mixture of Cessna 404s and Piper Navajos. A series of mergers between these carriers had, by 1982, resulted in the formation of Airlines of Tasmania. The new carrier went on a search for an aircraft that was larger than the Cessnas and Pipers, could carry a mixture of passengers and freight, was economical to operate and could cope with the frequently-strong crosswinds experienced on the Bass Strait islands. They settled on the four-engined De Havilland Heron, a number of which had been brought to Australia in the 1970s and re-engined with more powerful Lycoming engines to improve performance. Herons became the mainstay of Airlines of Tasmania's Launceston - Burnie - King Island route for most of the next decade, although at various times the airline also used an Embraer Bandierante or a Shorts 360. The need to replace the Herons at the end of their engineering lifespans saw Airlines of Tasmania enter a commercial arrangement with Tamworth-based regional airline Tamair in late 1994. Under the terms of this agreement the Herons were retired and a Fairchild Metroliner brought in from the Tamair fleet to take over the bulk of the flying to the Bass Strait islands. The collapse of the Tamair group in 1998 resulted in Airlines of Tasmania ceasing operations. Hobart-based Tasair emerged as the replacement operator for the King Island route, initially with a mixture of Piper Navajos and Aero Commanders before later using a British Aerospace Jetstream 31. Tasair ceased servicing Burnie in 2010, the airline subsequently entered voluntary liquidation in early 2012. Since 2012, the Launceston - Burnie - King Island route has been operated by regional carrier Sharp Airlines using Fairchild Metroliners. Since mid-2020, Sharp has also operated a twice-weekly service Hobart - Burnie - King Island, underwritten by the Tasmanian Government in order to support local tourism during the COVID pandemic.Other operators to have served Burnie/Wynyard Airport in the past are Aus-Air from Melbourne's Moorabbin Airport with a fleet of Piper Navajos and Embraer Bandierantes, Geelong Flight Centre between Geelong's Grovedale Airport and Burnie via King Island using Navajos and Partenavia P.68's, and Philip Island Air Services flew a Cessna 402 from Cowes.Until the early 2000s, Burnie was one of the few airports to have a railway line crossing an active runway, with the Western Line from Burnie to Wiltshire crossing through the northern end of runway 05/23.[11] Until 1990, the airport was manned during operating hours by a Flight Service Unit (FSU) which provided traffic and weather information. The staff also had the ability to control the railway signalling system from the FSU office overlooking the airport. A series of lights on a console would advise whether the railway track section was occupied, and FSU staff could either set the signal facing the train to stop, or alternatively warn aircraft that a train was approaching or obstructing the runway. When FSU operations for the area were centralised to Melbourne, those controllers also took charge of the signalling mechanism. With equipment upgrades due that would render the remote control of the signals unworkable, the Civil Aviation Authority devised a solution based on the system successfully used in the New Zealand city of Gisborne, which also has a railway crossing the airport runway. Detectors installed on the railway tracks approaching the airport boundary would activate a series of red or green lights facing approaching trains or aircraft. Since then, the runway has been shortened to no-longer cross the railway line, but the old runway segment is still visible from aerial photography.The railway line has not been in operation since 2003.[12]Burnie Airport was ranked 55th in Australia for the total number of revenue passengers served in the financial year 2016-2017.[2]*Showing annual statistics every 5 years (then yearly afterwards)"

Social Progressive Party of South Tyrol;"The Social Progressive Party of South Tyrol (German: Soziale Fortschrittspartei Südtirols, SFP) was a regionalist social-democratic party of German speakers South Tyrol that was active from 1966 to 1978.It was launched in 1966 by Egmont Jenny, former leader of the left-wing of the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP), and thanks to the support of the Socialist Party of Austria and its leader Bruno Kreisky. Its best electoral result was in 1968 when it won 2.4% of the vote, although not winning any seat in the Landtag of South Tyrol, while in 1973 it took 1.7% and got Jenny elected to the Provincial Council. The party, after having failed to merge with the Social Democratic Party of South Tyrol (5.1% in 1973) and even tried to form an alliance with the right-wing Party of Independents, it was disbanded in the late 1970s, with Jenny leaving the Landtag in 1978.[1][2]"
Teamway International Group;"Teamway International Group Holdings Limited is a Cayman-incorporated holding company based in Hong Kong and in the mainland China. It is a "registered non-Hong Kong company" in the Hong Kong Companies Registry since 2011.

Coat of arms of Tanzania;"The coat of arms of Tanzania comprises a warrior's shield which bears a golden portion on the upper part followed underneath by the flag of Tanzania.The golden portion represents minerals in the United Republic, the red portion underneath the flag symbolises the rich fertile soil of Africa, and the wavy bands represent the land, sea, lakes and coastal lines of the United Republic. In the golden part of the flag, there appears a burning torch signifying freedom (Uhuru), enlightenment and knowledge, a spear signifying defence of freedom and crossed axe and hoe being tools that the people of Tanzania use in developing the country. The shield stands upon the representation of Mount Kilimanjaro. Elephant tusks are supported by a man and a woman, with a clove bush at the feet of the man and a cotton bush at the feet of the woman (whose head is covered with a golden scarf) indicating the theme of co-operation.The United Republic motto below –Uhuru na Umoja– is written in Swahili and means "Freedom and Unity".The Coat of Arms of Tanzania was inspired by that of the Republic of Tanganyika. While the Tanganyika flag ("Independence Flag") was adopted by decree on the day of independence, 9th December, 1961, the flag, coat of arms and public seal were adopted into law on the first anniversary of independence in 1962.[1] On the Day of Union, just prior to mixing the soils of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, President Nyerere decreed the Emblem of Tanganyika would become the Emblem of Tanzania. In time a new emblem, from that of Tanganyika, was created that included the new Tanzanian flag adopted on the Day of Union. The new flag and coat of arms of the Union were adopted into law in 1971.[2]It is unknown who created the design. There are three well known claimants.TanganyikaZanzibar"

Internet activism;"Internet activism[a] is the use of electronic communication technologies such as social media, e-mail, and podcasts for various forms of activism to enable faster and more effective communication by citizen movements, the delivery of particular information to large and specific audiences as well as coordination. Internet technologies are used for cause-related fundraising, community building, lobbying, and organizing. A digital activism campaign is "anorganized public effort, making collective claims on a target authority, in which civic initiators or supporters use digital media."[1]  Research has started to address specifically how activist/advocacy groups in the U.S.[2] and Canada[3] are using social media to achieve digital activism objectives.Within online activism Sandor Vegh distinguished three principal categories: active/reactive, mobilizing and awareness raising-based.[4] There are other ways of classifying Internet activism, such as by the degree of reliance on the Internet versus offline mobilization. Thus, Internet sleuthing or hacking could be viewed as purely online forms of activism, whereas the Occupy Wall Street movement was mainly conducted offline, and only partially online.[5]: 84 Exploring the dynamics of online activism for expressing resistance to a powerful organization, a study developed a critical mass approach to online activism.[6] The results were integrated in a four-year longitudinal process model that explains how online activism started, generated societal outcomes, and changed over time. The model suggests that online activism helped organize collective actions and amplify the conditions for revolutionary movements to form. Yet, it provoked elites' reactions such as Internet filtering and surveillance, which do not only promote self-censorship and generate digital divide, but contribute to the ultimate decline of activism over time. The process model suggests a complex interplay among stakeholders' interests, opportunities for activism, costs, and outcomes that are neither foreseen nor entirely predictable. The authors challenge universal access to the Internet as a convenient and cost-free forum for practicing social activism by organizational stakeholders (customers, employees, outside parties). In fact, the technology enablers of social activism also enable its filtering and repression, and thus, more extreme states of information asymmetry may result in which powerful elites preserve their status and impose a greater digital divide.[7]In one study, a discussion of a developmental model of political mobilization is discussed. By citizens joining groups and creating discussion, they are beginning their first stage of involvement. Progressively, it is hoped that they will begin signing petitions online and graduating to offline contact as long as the organization provides the citizen with escalating steps of involvement (Vitak et al., 2011).[8]The issue of the mass media's centrality has been highly contested, with some people arguing that it promoted the voices of marginalized groups while others believe it sends forth the messages of the majority alone, leaving minority groups to have their voices robbed.[9]One case that has to do with the history of online activism is the one of Lotus MarketPlace.[10] On April 10, 1990, Lotus announced a direct-mail marketing database product that was to contain name, address, and spending habit information on 120 million individual U.S. citizens. While much of the same data was already available, privacy advocates worried about the availability of this data within one database. Furthermore, the data would be on CD-ROM, and so would remain fixed until a new CD-ROM was issued.In response, a mass e-mail and E-bulletin-board campaign was started, which included information on contacting Lotus and form letters. Larry Seiler, a New England-based computer professional, posted a message that was widely reposted on newsgroups and via e-mail: "It will contain a LOT of personal information about YOU, which anyone in the country can access by just buying the discs. It seems to me (and to a lot of other people, too) that this will be a little too much like big brother, and it seems like a good idea to get out while there is still time." Over 30,000 people contacted Lotus and asked for their names to be removed from the database. On January 23, 1991, Lotus announced that it had cancelled MarketPlace.[11]In 1993, a survey article about online activism around the world, from Croatia to the United States, appeared in The Nation magazine, with several activists being quoted about their projects and views.[12][13]The earliest example of mass emailing as a rudimentary form of DDoS occurred on Guy Fawkes Day 1994, when the Intervasion of the UK began email-bombing John Major's cabinet and UK parliamentary servers in protest against the Criminal Justice Bill, which outlawed outdoor rave festivals and "music with a repetitive beat"In 1995–1998, Z magazine offered courses online through Left Online University, with lessons on "Using the Internet for Electronic Activism".[14]The practice of cyber-dissidence and activism per se, that is, in its modern-day form, may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a Gabonese scholar and activist living in political exile in New Jersey in the United States. In 1998, he created a Website in French whose name Bongo Doit Partir (Bongo Must Go)[15] was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of Omar Bongo in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/,[16] began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org[17] in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved blogosphere, this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 Tunisian and Egyption revolutions, where the Internet has proven to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition, and revolution against dictators. In July 2003, Amnesty International reported the arrest of five Gabonese known-to-be members of the cyber-dissident group Bongo Doit Partir. The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience[18] and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience).[19]Another well-known example of early Internet activism took place in 1998, when the Mexican rebel group EZLN used decentralized communications, such as cell phones, to network with developed world activists and help create the anti-globalization group Peoples Global Action (PGA) to protest the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva.[20] The PGA continued to call for "global days of action" and rally support of other anti-globalization groups in this way.[21]Later, a worldwide network of Internet activist sites, under the umbrella name of Indymedia, was created "for the purpose of providing grassroots coverage of the WTO protests in Seattle" in 1999.[22][23][24]  Dorothy Kidd quotes Sheri Herndon in a July 2001 telephone interview about the role of the Internet in the anti-WTO protests: "The timing was right, there was a space, the platform was created, the Internet was being used, we could bypass the corporate media, we were using open publishing, we were using multimedia platforms. So those hadn't been available, and then there was the beginning of the anti-globalization movement in the United States."[25]In the UK, in 1999, the Government introduced a new employment tax called IR35. One of the first online trade associations was created to campaign against it. Within weeks they had raised £100,000 off the Internet from individuals who had never even met. They became a fully formed trade association called the Professional Contractors Group, which two years later had 14,000 members all paying £100 each to join. They presented the first ever e-petition to Parliament and organized one of the first flash mobs when using their database, to their surprise and others, 1,000 came in their call to lobby Parliament. They later raised £500,000 from the Internet to fund an unsuccessful High Court challenge against the tax, though ultimately they secured some concessions. Their first external affairs director, Philip Ross, has written a history of the campaign.[26]The engagement in the practice of strategic voting was another development that came with Internet activism. People coordinated their vote pairing by entering their contact information into an online database, thereby reducing cost completely.[27]Kony 2012, a short film released on March 5, 2012,[28][29][30][31] was intended to promote the charity's "Stop Kony" movement to make African cult and militia leader, indicted war criminal and the International Criminal Court fugitive Joseph Kony globally known in order to have him arrested by the end of 2012,[32]  when the campaign expired. The film spread virally.[33][34][35] A poll suggested that more than half of young adult Americans heard about Kony 2012 in the days following the video's release.[36][37][38] It was included among the top international events of 2012 by PBS[39] and called the most viral video ever by TIME.[40] The campaign resulted in a resolution by the United States Senate and contributed to the decision to send troops by the African Union.Internet activism has had the effect of causing increased collective action among people, as found by Postmes and Brunsting (2002), who discovered a tendency among internet users to rely on internalized group memberships and social identities in order to achieve social involvement online.[41] The Internet is "tailor-made for a populist, insurgent movement," says Joe Trippi,[42] who managed the Howard Dean campaign. In his campaign memoir, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, Trippi notes that:[The Internet's] roots in the open-source ARPAnet, its hacker culture, and its decentralized, scattered architecture make it difficult for big, establishment candidates, companies and media to gain control of it. And the establishment loathes what it can't control. This independence is by design, and the Internet community values above almost anything the distance it has from the slow, homogeneous stream of American commerce and culture. Progressive candidates and companies with forward-looking vision have an advantage on the Internet, too. Television is, by its nature, a nostalgic medium. Look at Ronald Reagan's campaign ads in the 1980s – they were masterpieces of nostalgia promising a return to America's past glory and prosperity. The Internet, on the other hand, is a forward-thinking and forward-moving medium, embracing change and pushing the envelope of technology and communication.The Internet is a key resource for independent activists, or E-activists, particularly those whose message may run counter to the mainstream. "Especially when a serious violation of human rights occurs, the Internet is essential in reporting the atrocity to the outside world."[43] Listservs like Freedom News Group or BurmaNet assist in spreading news that would otherwise be inaccessible in these countries.[5]: 84  Internet activists also pass on E-petitions to be sent to the government as well as to private and  public interest groups and organizations to protest against and urge for implementing positive policy changes in areas from the animal testing to arms trade. Many non-profits and charities use these methods, emailing petitions to those on their email list and asking people to pass them on. The Internet also enables organizations such as NGOs to communicate with individuals in an inexpensive and timely manner. Indeed, many non-profit and advocacy organizations rely on the internet to launch campaigns with socially conscious messages to maintain a constant stream of revenue.[44] Gatherings and protests can be organized with the input of the organizers and the participants. Lobbying is also made easier via the Internet, thanks to mass e-mail and its ability to broadcast a message widely at little cost. Vegh's concept of organization/mobilization, for example, can refer to activities taking place solely online, solely offline but organized online, or a combination of online and offline. Mainstream social-networking sites, most noticeably Facebook.com, are also making e-activist tools available to their users.  An active participatory culture is enabled by the communities on social networking sites because they permit communication between groups that are otherwise unable to communicate. In the article "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community", Nessim Watson emphasizes the necessity of communication in online communities. He claims that "without ongoing communication among its participants, a community dissolves". The constant ability to interact with members of the community enriches online experiences and redefines the very word community.[45]Hashtag activism is the use of hashtags for fighting or supporting a cause through the usage of social media outlets.[46] The term "hashtag activism" first started circulating within journalism in 2011.[47] Since then, its use has been associated with movements such as #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, #SayHerName, and many more.One example of the powerful rise of hashtag activism can be seen in the black feminist movement's use of hashtags to convey their cause. The famous hashtag "IamJada" was an internet backlash to the mocking "#Jadapose" that went viral, ensuing after sixteen-year-old girl Jada Smith was photographed following her gang rape [48] In this instance, a hashtag was employed to convey a powerful anti-rape message.Yet another instance of where this type of activism was utilized for the matter of feminism and women's right, occurred in China in relation to the outbreak of COVID-19. While the rule of the country put efforts into trying to hide and downplay the start of what would develop into the pandemic, pressured hospitals were in need of supplies in form of menstrual protection and related products. Supplies which they, despite the fact that the vast majority of the medical workers is made up of females, were not given access to.[49] Amongst others, hashtags such as #RefusePeriodShame, circulated in protest to the ongoing situation and the Wuhan hospital authorities, who were considered responsible for it. Soon to follow on the same thread, one of the VTubers of the Chinese Communist Youth Party League (CYL), known as Jiangshanjiao, an avatar displayed as a youthful female, gave rise to #JiangshanjiaoDoYouGetYourPeriod. The hashtag initially sparked from a post on Weibo where a user sarcastically wrote that exact question, to point out the absurdness in the societal denial of women's biological functions and needs. #JiangshanjiaoDoYouGetYourPeriod, while, like the previous hashtag mentioned, being censored and taken down by the government, had time to spread and catch a lot more attention than what #RefusePeriodShame did, and up until 15 March 2020, it accumulated over 89,200,000 views.[49]Other notable instances in which marginalized groups have used hashtags as organizing tools for social justice include responses to racial violence and police profiling, as in the case of #BlackLivesMatter and #JusticeForTrayvon, along with misogyny and gendered violence, such as #MeToo and #YesAllWomen.[50]One of the most prominent uses of hashtag activism is #BlackLivesMatter, a social justice movement that first began after George Zimmerman was acquitted for the shooting and killing of Trayvon Martin, an African American teenage boy. The movement started as a hashtag and now it has been at the forefront of the fight against police brutality and racial profiling across the world.After the killing of Martin on February 26, 2012, several people wanted justice. The hashtag started to grow in popularity, with a Change.org petition calling for an investigation and prosecution of George Zimmerman.[47] Social media users, including many celebrities retweeted, shared, and created new petitions, eventually raising over 2.1 million signatures combined by March 26, 2012. By April 11, 2012, Zimmerman was charged with the second-degree murder of Trayvon Martin.[47]After George Zimmerman was acquitted on July 13, 2013, a "letter to Black folks" was posted to Facebook by Alicia Garza. Garza ended her letter with the statement "Black lives matter", which her friend turned into a hashtag below.[51] From here, #BlackLivesMatter or simply "BLM" became the movement against police brutality and killings of unarmed African Americans, as well as hate crimes and racially motivated crimes.[52]#BlackLivesMatter's impact does not end online. The formation of Black Lives Matter allowed for activists across the United States to organize in-person protests and rallies together, no matter where they may be located.[53] U.S. politicians—such as Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—have endorsed Black Lives Matter, aligning themselves with a push for racial justice.The most recent display of how the Black Lives Matter movement has been used as a platform for offline activism is the 2020 BLM protests that occurred after 17-year old Darnella Frazier live-streamed on Facebook the murder of George Floyd by then-police officer Derek Chauvin. Protests took place in all 50 states, as well as in many countries around the world.[54]After the Parkland, FL mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018, #MarchForOurLives was born. Students came together to create this hashtag to fight for gun control in the U.S. This hashtag turned into an entire movement of over 800 protests across the United States with the main protest taking place in Washington, D.C.[55] There was an estimated 200,000 people in attendance at the Washington, D.C. protest, alone.[56]TikTok's platform has been increasingly used for raising up social issues through creative short videos, especially after an allegedly make-up tutorial turned into a call to action on China's treatment of Muslim Uighurs.[57] The tutorial was banned for 50 minutes on November 26, 2019. Eric Han, the heads of TikTok's US content-moderation team, claimed the banning was due to a “human moderation error”. The Chinese owners declared the app does not remove content based on sensitivities to China.[58]TikTok also partnered up with UN Women in a campaign fighting women violence in India which kicked off on November 25, 2019. The campaign can be found under the hashtag #KaunsiBadiBaatHai and features short videos with positive and negative examples of men interacting with women.[59]In July 2020, the TikTok platform played a major role in the #FreeBritney movement surrounding Britney Spears and her conservatorship dispute. Though such activism led to a significant increase in public awareness of the case, it was criticized for spreading misinformation regarding the conservatorship alongside a number of conspiracy theories of varying accuracy.[60]When discussing the 2004 U.S. presidential election candidates, Carol Darr, director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., said of the candidates which benefited from use of the Internet to attract supporters: "They are all charismatic, outspoken mavericks and insurgents. Given that the Internet is interactive and requires an affirmative action on the part of the users, as opposed to a passive response from TV users, it is not surprising that the candidate has to be someone people want to touch and interact with."[61]A more decentralized approach to campaigning arose, in contrast to a top-down, message-focused approach usually conducted in the mainstream. "The mantra has always been, 'Keep your message consistent. Keep your message consistent,'" said John Hlinko, who has participated in Internet campaigns for MoveOn.org and the electoral primary campaign of Wesley Clark. "That was all well and good in the past. Now it's a recipe for disaster. You can choose to have a Stalinist structure that's really doctrinaire and that's really opposed to grassroots. Or you can say, 'Go forth. Do what you're going to do.' As long as we're running in the same direction, it's much better to give some freedom."[62]Two-thirds of Internet users under the age of 30 have a SNS, and during the 2008 election, half of them used a SNS site for candidate information (Hirzalla, 2010).[63] MoveOn.org endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008, and used this endorsement as an opportunity to encourage grassroots advertising. MoveOn hosted a competition that requested submissions from ordinary citizens with the criteria the digital ads were positive towards Obama. The contest drew 1,000 entries of 30-second ads for Obama that streamed on YouTube.[64] This endorsement by a grassroots organization, and the ensuing contest, is an example of agenda setting that scholars have been studying ever since social media and digital content began influencing presidential politics.[64]Studies delving into the 2008 presidential campaign examined inequality online of various ideologies deriving from various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Scholars concluded the 2008 race, and the influence of online politicking, did not see an empowerment of new voices.[65] The idea that digital literacy become a concept taught in school, with educators incorporating blogging, commenting, and creating content as part of their curriculum, has been bandied about among social and political scientists in an effort to turn online enthusiasm from young people into demonstrable results at the ballot box.[66]The 2016 presidential election changed the digital landscape again. Digital media scholars note that the hopes of developing digital literacy post 2008 turned into a fomenting distrust of traditional news media. People of all ages and political inclinations gravitated towards social media sources that acted as echo chambers, and online personalities and organizations were held in higher esteem than traditional news sources.[67]The Internet has become the catalyst for protests such as Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring as those involved have increasingly relied on social media to organize and stay connected.In Myanmar, online news paper Freedom News Group has leaked some government corruption and fuel to protests.[68][69]In 2017, the Sleeping Giants cyberactivist group, among others, launched a boycott campaign against controversial, conservative webpage Breitbart News, getting more than 2,000 organizations to remove it from ad buys.[70][71][72][73][74][75]Corporations are also using Internet activist techniques to increase support for their causes. According to Christopher Palmeri with BusinessWeek Online, companies launch sites with the intent to positively influence their own public image, to provide negative pressure on competitors, to influence opinion within select groups, and to push for policy changes.[76]The clothing manufacturer, American Apparel is an example: The company hosts a website called Legalize LA that advocates immigration reform via blog, online advertising, links to news stories and educational materials.[77][78]  Protest groups have responded by posting YouTube videos and establishing a boycott website.[79][80]Corporate methods of information dissemination is labelled "astroturfing", as opposed to "grassroots activism", due to the funding for such movements being largely private.[81] More recent examples include the right-wing FreedomWorks.org which organized the "Taxpayer March on Washington" on September 12, 2009, and the Coalition to Protect Patients' Rights, which opposes universal health care in the U.S.[82]Cybersectarianism is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support, domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards."[83]The Internet is widely accessible by everyone and as a result, it has since its beginning increasingly become a place where various opinions are expressed and not seldom are those opinions ones from some very far end of the spectrum. Extremists of different sorts have come to heavily rely on the Internet, to the point where it is no longer just a means amongst others to achieve a certain objective, but more than often it is where the main part of a movement takes place.[84] Activities such as the conveyance of, perceivably extreme, bureaucratic ideas, or even the outlining of strategic acts of violence or destruction, are ones nowadays likely to occur online. This type of "online extremism" could, though difficult to precisely define, in other words be described as the subcategory of Internet activism that is brought forward by, or connected with, stand alone persons or bodies of persons, that possess what are generally viewed to be extreme opinions.[84] However, while it is indeed problematic to interpret exactly what to define it as, online extremism can be traced back to as far as the 1980s, and despite the tendency and appearance of it continuously and quickly changing, it is expected to remain frequently utilized be extremists for the future to come.In 1998, former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke wrote on his website, “I believe that the internet will begin a chain reaction of racial enlightenment that will shake the world by the speed of its intellectual conquest.”[85] White nationalists quickly saw the potential of the Internet as a platform to effectively disseminate their message to a mass audience.This exploitation of technological innovations is not a novel concept for this group. In the early 20th century, with the emergence of film technology, the KKK created their own film companies and produced films like The Toll of Justice (1923)  to spread their message.[86] Then, a century later, with the rise of digital technologies, the KKK adapted to the changing media landscape to become a digital movement. They not only adapted to the digital age, but also found vulnerabilities through which they could most quickly and efficiently insert their ideologies.[87] Examples of this included strategic domain names and hidden propaganda content.Today, white nationalists' efforts to push their principles on the Web combined with tech companies' belief in the Internet as "raceless" motivate white nationalists to continue to exploit algorithms and influence digital spaces such as Twitter.[88] As algorithms work in a self-reinforcing manner, they worsen the psychological effects of confirmation bias. They provide search results that confirm one's beliefs and biases and, further, connect one to communities of like-minded people. This works in favor of white nationalists, for example, search engines' autocomplete features suggest racist notions, and make White supremacist sites readily accessible to users.[89]One of the earliest books on activism was Don Rittner's Ecolinking: Everyone's Guide to Online Environmental Information, published by Peachpit Press in 1992.  Rittner, an environmental activist from upstate New York, spent more than 20 years researching and saving the Albany Pine Barrens.  He was a beta tester for America Online and ran their Environmental Forum for the company from 1988 to when it launched in 1990.  He took his early environmental knowledge and computer savvy and wrote what was called the bible of the online environmental community.  It showed new Net users how to get online, find environmental information, connect to environmentalists around the world, and how to use those resources to save the planet.[90]In August 2018, a movement of environmental activism was initiated in Sweden, by now widely known climate activist Greta Thunberg. It all started with Greta, 15 years of age at the time and influenced by the creation of #MarchForOurLives, giving her opinion on the ongoing climate change, by displaying a large sign in front of the Swedish Riksdag (parliament) in protest.[91] This act would start the "School Strike for Climate" (SSC) (Swedish: Skolstrejk för klimatet), a movement that would eventually spread, largely through attention in media, across the globe and develop into something that came to be internationally named "Fridays for Future" (FFF). Through having children miss classes on Fridays to participate in the strike, it has from the moment it started until today, reached and affected leading governments of the world by raising environmental awareness.[91]In 2020 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the National Trust began the #BlossomWatch campaign, which encouraged people to share the first signs of Spring with one another, in particular images of blossom.[92]Activism against sexual assault is often led on the internet, where individuals may feel comfortable talking about uncomfortable topics. One such movements is the #NotGuilty movement. This movement began in April 2015 when Ione Wells, an Oxford University student shared a "letter to her attacker" in her college paper.[93] The letter described how she was sexually assaulted and how she chose to respond and build from that point in her life. At the end of the letter she urged readers to send a letter back describing their own sexual assault experience with the hashtag #notguilty. She received so many letters from locals that she decided to create a website called "notGuiltyCampaign.co.uk". This caused global attention and inspired many to share their stories.[94]The Me Too movement is a similar movement that started in Hollywood. Initially, the activist Tarana Burke created the phrase back in 2006 to "empower women through empathy", but first over a decade later, the actress Alyssa Milano gave birth to the usage of the saying that would lead to the eventual spread of it, after using it in a post on twitter, in which she acknowledged several accusations of sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein.[95] It would from there on not be long until it stretched and attached on various online plattforms, and in no more than a day after Milano's tweet, the #MeToo hashtag had been reused over 500,000 times on that same media, as well as 4.7 million times on Facebook. The phrase was first used to demonstrate the amount of sexual assault that happens to young actresses and actors in Hollywood, and it was largely due to the early involvement of several well known individuals from the entertainment industry, who used the hashtag in their own posts, that the movement achieved the spread that it did.[95] It soon expanded to apply to all forms of sexual assault, especially in the work place, and with time it also came to move from concerning mainly white heterosexual women, to eventually being used by both men and women with different sexualities and ethnicity.These movements were intended to create an outlet for men and women to share their experiences with those with similar views without blame or guilt. They brought widespread attention to sexual assault and caused much controversy about changes that should be made accordingly.[96] Criticism around movements such as these centers on concerns about whether or not participants are being dishonest for their own gain or are misinterpreting acts of kindness.[97] However, the same Me Too movement, which also reached Egypt showed the adverse side of the activism where witness detention in one of the high-profile rape cases highlighted the prioritisation of traditional social morality by the government over women's rights in the country.[98]Denial-of-Service attacks, the taking over and vandalizing of a website, uploading Trojan horses, and sending out e-mail bombs (mass e-mailings) are also examples of Internet activism. While the concept is difficult to exactly pinpoint, the phrase "hacktivism" summarizes the act of somehow utilizing hacking capabilities as a means to achieve some type of political goal, and the expression is occasionally also referred to as a variation of "cyberterrorism".[99] The varieties of different routes groups of hacktivists choose to approach the organization, website or forum that they are taking on, can be categorized into different tactics. Some examples of those tactics or strategies are "DDoS attacks", "Doxing", and "Webdefacement", all of which are slightly different ways of reaching an often similar end goal.[99] For additional understanding and explanation, as well as for more specific examples of these types of subversive actions, see hacktivism.[100]According to some observers, the Internet may have considerable potential to reach and engage opinion leaders who influence the thinking and behavior of others. According to the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet, what they call "Online Political Citizens" (OPCs) are "seven times more likely than average citizens to serve as opinion leaders among their friends, relatives and colleagues… Normally, 10% of Americans qualify as Influentials. Our study found that 69% of Online Political Citizens are Influentials."[101]Information communication technologies (ICTs) make communication and information readily available and efficient. There are millions of Facebook accounts, Twitter users and websites, and one can educate oneself on nearly any subject. While this is for the most part a positive thing, it can also be dangerous. For example, people can read up on the latest news events relatively easily and quickly, however, there is danger in the fact that apathy or fatigue can quickly arise when people are inundated with so many messages, or that the loudest voice on a subject can often be the most extreme one, distorting public perception on the issue.These social networks which occupy ICTs are simply modern forms of political instruments which pre-date the technological era.[102] People can now go to online forums or Twitter instead of town hall meetings. People can essentially mobilize worldwide through the Internet. Women can create transnational alliances and lobby for rights within their respective countries, they can give each other tips and share up-to-date information. This information becomes "hyper textual", available in downloadable formats with easy access for all.[102] The UN organizations also use "hyper textual" formats. They can post information about upcoming summits, they can post newsletters on what occurred at these meetings, and links to videos can be shared, all of this information can be downloaded at the click of a button.[102] The UN and many other actors are presenting this information in an attempt to get a certain message out in the cyber sphere and consequently steer public perception on an issue.[103]With all this information so readily available, there is a rising trend of "slacktivism" or "clicktivism".  While it is positive that information can be distributed so quickly and efficiently all around the world, there is negativity in the fact that people often take this information for granted, or quickly forget about it once they have seen it flash across our computer screens.[102]  Viral campaigns are great for sparking initial interest and conversation, but they are not as effective in the long term—people begin to think that clicking "like" on something is enough of a contribution, or that posting information about a current hot topic on their Facebook page or Twitter feed means that they have made a difference.The Internet has also made it easier for small donors to play a meaningful role in financing political campaigns. Previously, small-donor fundraising was prohibitively expensive, as costs of printing and postage ate up most of the money raised.[104] Groups like MoveOn, however, have found that they can raise large amounts of money from small donors at minimal cost, with credit card transaction fees constituting their biggest expense. "For the first time, you have a door into the political process that isn't marked 'big money,' " says Darr. "That changes everything."The Internet also allows ordinary people to contribute materially to Humanitarian relief projects designed to intervene in situations of global disaster or tragedy, as in the case of the "Hope for Haiti Now" telethon event, which was launched three days after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. The telethon and its broadcast became an effective vehicle to present a plea for support and to collect contributions quickly, facilitating a relationship between entertainment and humanitarian fundraising that has developed in response to historical and economic market conditions.[105][106]With internet technology vastly changing existing and introducing new mechanisms by which to attain, share and employ information, internet activism raises ethical issues for consideration. Proponents contend internet activism serves as an outlet for social progress but only if personal and professional ethics are employed.[107] Supporters of online activism claim new information and communications technologies help increase the political power of activist groups that would otherwise have less resources. Proponents along this line of thinking claim the most effective use of online activism is its use in conjunction with more traditional or historical activism activities.[108] Conversely, critics worry about facts and beliefs becoming indistinct in online campaigns and about "sectors of online activism [being] more self-interested than socially interested."[107] These critics warn against the manipulation commonplace to online activism for private or personal interests such as exploiting charities for monetary gain, influencing voters in the political arena and inflating self-importance or effectiveness. In this sense, the ethical implication is that activism becomes descriptive rather than transformative of society.[107]  One of these reviewers suggests seven pitfalls to beware of in internet activism: "self-promotion at the expense of the movement... unsolicited bulk email... Hacktivism... violating copyright... nagging... violating privacy... and being scary."[109] Many of the ethical criticisms against the prevalence of online activism are further discussed in the criticisms section of this article.Critics argue that Internet activism faces the same challenges as other aspects of the digital divide, particularly the global digital divide. Some say it gives disproportionate representation to those with greater access or technological ability.[110][111] Groups that may be disadvantaged by the move to activist activity online are those that have limited access to technologies, or lack the technological literacy to engage meaningfully online, these include ethnic and racial minorities, those of lower socioeconomic status, those with lower levels of education, and the elderly. Issues like racism and sexism are issues that internet activists reportedly deal with.[112]A study looked at the impact of Social Networking Sites (SNS) on various demographics and their political activity. Not surprisingly college students used SNS for political activity the most but this was followed by a more unlikely group, those that had not completed high school. In addition the probability for non-White citizens to consume political information was shown to be higher than that of Whites. These two outcomes go in the face of normal predictors of political activity. Despite these surprising findings older generations, men and whites showed the highest levels of political mobilization. Acts of political mobilization, such as fundraising, volunteering, protesting require the most continued interest, resources and knowledge (Nam, 2010).[113]The experience of the echo chamber is easier to create with a computer than with many of the forms of political interaction that preceded it," Sunstein told the New York Times. "The discussion will be about strategy, or horse-race issues or how bad the other candidates are, and it will seem like debate. It's not like this should be censored, but it can increase acrimony, increase extremism and make mutual understanding more difficult.On the other hand, Scott Duke Harris of the San Jose Mercury News noted that "the Internet connects [all sides of issues, not just] an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of ANSWER to the pressed-for-time 'soccer moms' who might prefer MoveOn, and conservative activists as well."[114]Another concern, according to University of California, Santa Cruz professor Barbara Epstein, is that the Internet "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case." She warns that the impersonal nature of communication by computer may actually undermine the human contact that always has been crucial to social movements.[115]Another concern, expressed by author and law professor Cass Sunstein, is that online political discussions lead to "cyberbalkanization"—discussions that lead to fragmentation and polarization rather than consensus, because the same medium that lets people access a large number of news sources also enables them to pinpoint the ones they agree with and ignore the rest.Famed activist Ralph Nader has stated that "the Internet doesn't do a very good job of motivating action", citing that the United States Congress, corporations and the Pentagon do not necessarily "fear the civic use of the Internet."[116] Ethan Zuckerman talks about "slacktivism", claiming that the Internet has devalued certain currencies of activism.[117] Citizens may "like" an activist group on Facebook, visit a website, or comment on a blog, but fail to engage in political activism beyond the Internet, such as volunteering or canvassing. This critique has been criticized as Western-centric, however, because it discounts the impact this can have in authoritarian or repressive contexts.[118] Journalist Courtney C. Radsch argued that even this low level of engagement was an important form of activism for Arab youth because it is a form of free speech, and can spark mainstream media coverage.[119] University of North Carolina professor Zeynep Tufekci has argued that the need to put in significant organizing time in the pre-Internet era is what gave street protests their strength.[120]Scholars are divided about whether the Internet will increase or decrease political participation, including online activism or "slacktivism".[121] Those who suggest political participation will increase believe the Internet can be used to recruit and communicate with more users, and offers lower-costs modes of participation for those who lack the time or motivation to engage otherwise. Those concerned that the Internet will decrease activism argue that the Internet occupies free time that can no longer be spent getting involved in activist groups, or that Internet activism will replace more substantial, effortful forms of in-person activism. The Pew Research Center has found that platforms create distraction resulting in consumers and online activists believe they are making a difference while their sharing their post is only furthering the echo chamber of media.[122]  The Pew Research Center has also found that about 79% of adults believe that "slacktivism" distracts consumers from issues that are truly important[122]  and that the majorty of adults found that social media resulted in some of form of negative result. [121]Journalist and writer Malcolm Gladwell argues that activism through social media and the internet cannot be successful because they promote a 'lazy' way of activism that doesn't require people to put in meaningful effort. For example 'liking' a protest related post on social media, people feel like they have contributed to a cause, which makes them less likely to take more costly, and some would argue more effective, action like joining a protest.[123][124]With cases such as the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, it shows how internet activism can become more than slacktivism. Scholars have found that internet activist communities and offline activist communities work closely together, rather than being two separate entities.[125] With internet activism, activists can organize without the constraints of physical location. The Pew Research Center has found that eight-in-ten Americans have been proven effecting in spreading information and awareness for varying public issues. [121]Whether this is due to physical, mental, or financial constraints, internet activism may be the most accessible and comfortable for disabled people. If able to attend a physical protest, the inaccessibility of public spaces is often too large of a roadblock to participation.[126] In some cases, such as protests involving the subject of disability, alternative protest options may be available, but this is not common for public protests. This is something to take into account when evaluating slacktivism. If there are no options available, internet activism can be a way for those who are passionate about an issue to be able to advocate for it.Similar to "slacktivism", performative activism refers to the action of acting as if one is an advocate or activist – often on social media – for personal gain. This term is used as a negative term towards those who seem to be untruthful or exaggerating their activism work. Performative activism became frequently used after the 2020 BLM protests, this term started to become widely used as many took to social media to participate in the Black Lives Matter movement. The intentions of a lot of new activists and allies were questioned. On June 2, 2021, the social media platform, Instagram, was flooded with millions of the same image.[127] These images were black squares under the hashtag, #BlackoutTuesday. The purpose of this online protest was to amplify Black voices on social media. However, many criticized this protest, arguing that the protest had the opposite effect as the squares flooded the important #BlackLivesMatter hashtag.[128] People started to accuse those who participated in Blackout Tuesday, but did not do anything else in regards to the Black Lives Matter movement, of being performative activists.Another criticism is clicktivism. According to techopedia, clicktivism is a controversial form of digital activism. Proponents believe that applying advertising principles such as A/B testing increases the impact of a message by leveraging the Internet to further its reach. Opponents believe that clicktivism reduces activism to a mere mouse-click, yielding numbers with little or no real engagement or commitment to the cause.[129]Micah M. White argues, "Political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links. In promoting the illusion that surfing the web can change the world, clicktivism is to activism as McDonalds is to a slow-cooked meal. It may look like food, but the life-giving nutrients are long gone."[130] He argues that political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links and neglects the vital, immeasurable inner-events and personal epiphanies that great social ruptures are actually made of. It reduces activism to a mere mouse click.[131] Micah M. White goes on to argue that "clicktivism reinforces the fear of standing out from the crowd and taking a strong position. It discourages calling for drastic action. And as such, clicktivism will never breed social revolution. To think that it will is a fallacy. One that is dawning on us".[130]In Net Delusion, author Evgeny Morozov argues against cyberutopianism. He describes how the Internet is successfully used against activists and for the sake of state repression.[132] China presents a good example of this. Internet censorship in China has often been used as a way to achieve political stability of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).[133]"

He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West Scotland region from the 2016 Scottish Parliament election until the 2021 election. He is currently the Provost of Argyll & Bute.Corry joined the British Army in 1972 serving initially with the 51st Highland Volunteers part of the Territorial Army.[1] Captain Corry was awarded the Efficiency Decoration in 1984.,[2] a first clasp to the medal in February 1994[3] and a second clasp in 1997[4] He was promoted to major in June 1984.[5] Major Corry was transferred to the Black Watch in February 1995.[6] He retired from the Royal Regiment of Scotland in September 2009.[7]Corry was elected to the Argyll and Bute council, representing Lomond North in 2012.[8]In 2016, Corry stood for the Scottish Parliament as the Conservative candidate for Dumbarton where he came third, then was elected from the West Scotland regional list.[9] Corry sat on the Parliamnet's Public Petitions Committee.[10] After his election to the Scottish Parliament he also continued in his position as a local councillor.[11] He is the Conservative's spokesperson for veterans' affairs.[12] In May 2016 in a Holyrood EU Referendum debate, Corry voted to back the case to leave the European Union. He later explained he had pressed the wrong button during the vote.[13]At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Corry contested the Dumbarton constituency, a Labour–SNP marginal where he came a distant third with 8.3% of the votes.[14]  He was placed eighth on the Conservative list for West Scotland,[15] so he did not win one of the region's three lists seats.[16]  Corry's low placement on the list followed his omission from a list of endorsements by a vetting committee set up by Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Conservatives in the Scottish Parliament.[17]In the 2022 Council Election, he was returned once again to Argyll & Bute as a member for Lomond North, and was appointed Provost by the administration on May 18th 2022.[18][19]This article about a member of the Scottish Parliament is a stub.

Eugene Davy;"Eugene O'Donnell Davy (26 July 1904 – 11 November 1996) was an Ireland international rugby union fly-half.Davy was born into an affluent family in County Dublin on 26 July 1904.[1] He was one of nine surviving children of Thomas Davy, a merchant, and his wife Alice. According to 1911 Irish census, both Davy's parents were originally from County Tipperary and his family were living at 29 Terenure Road East, Rathgar.[2] He attended Belvedere College where he was a contemporary of Kevin Barry. He attended University College Dublin and captained the university rugby team in the 1925–26 season.[3]Davy's club side was Lansdowne Football Club. The club won the Leinster Senior Cup five consecutive times from 1927 to 1931 and the Bateman Cup (the all-Ireland championship) on three occasions between 1928–29 and 1930–31.[4]He won 34 international caps for Ireland between 1925 and 1934. His debut was on 14 March 1925 against Wales.[1] He played his final international against England  on 10 February 1934.[1] In his international career he scored eight tries and three drop goals and was part of the Irish team that shared the 1926 Five Nations Championship.[1] In 1930 he made history by scoring three tries in eight minutes in a 14–11 win over Scotland at Murrayfield. As of January 2009 he is among the top twenty try-scorers in Irish rugby history.[5]He was manager of Ireland on their victorious 1967 tour of Australia.[6] He also served as president of the IRFU in 1967–68.[7]In 1926 Davy and his brother James founded Davy Stockbrokers, now one of Ireland's leading providers of financial services.[8]He died on 11 November 1996, aged 92.[9]In 1999 UCD inaugurated the 'Davy Bursary' in his honour.

1812 United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania;"Elections to the United States House of Representatives were held in Pennsylvania on October 13, 1812, for the 13th Congress.In the previous election, 17 Democratic-Republicans and 1 Federalist had been elected to represent Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania was divided at this time into 15 districts, 9 of which were single-member districts, five of which had two members, and one of which had four members.  Following the 1810 Census, Pennsylvania underwent redistricting.  Most of the new districts had little correspondence to the former districts, for example, the old 3rd district was divided between the new 2nd, 3rd, and 7th districts.  The 1st, 9th and 10th districts were unaltered, except for renumbering of the old 9th and 10th to 13th and 12th respectively, and the addition of a 4th seat to the 1st district.Sixteen incumbents (all Democratic-Republicans) ran for re-election, of whom 14 were re-elected.  The incumbents James Milnor (F) of the 1st district and Joseph Lefever (DR) of the old 3rd district did not run for re-election.  The two incumbents who lost re-election lost to members of the same party, while six of the seven open seats were won by Democratic-Republicans, a net increase of 5 seats for the Democratic-Republicans and no change for the Federalists.Three of the re-elected Representatives did not serve in the 13th Congress, two of whom did not finish their term in the 12th Congress either.[4] John Smilie (DR), re-elected to the 13th district, died on December 30, 1812 and Abner Lacock (DR), re-elected to the 15th district, resigned February 24, 1813 after being elected to the Senate. Smilie was replaced by Isaac Griffin in a special election held February 16, 1813.  The only record of that election is a manuscript which indicates he won by a 779-vote majority, but does not record the name(s) of his opponent(s) nor the total number of votes cast.  Robert Whitehill (DR) of the 5th district died April 8, 1813.[5]  The election in the 5th district was held May 11, 1813 and in the 15th on May 4, 1813Neither seat changed political parties, and both took their seats at the beginning of the 1st session of the 13th Congress, which lasted May 24 - August 2, 1813[5]John Gloninger (F) of the 3rd district and John M. Hyneman (DR) of the 7th district both resigned August 2, 1813, at the end of the 1st session.  They were replaced in special elections held on October 12, 1813Both took their seats December 6, 1813, at the start of the 2nd session.  With Crouch's victory in the 3rd district, the sole Federalist-held seat in Pennsylvania changed to Democratic-Republican control, thus Pennsylvania's delegation was completely Democratic-Republican during the 2nd session, which lasted December 6, 1813 - April 18, 1814[5]Jonathan Roberts (DR) of the 2nd district resigned February 24, 1814 upon being elected to the Senate and James Whitehill (DR) of the 3rd district resigned September 1, 1814.  Both were replaced in a special election held October 11, 1814, the same day as the 1814 congressional elections.Both seats changed from Democratic-Republican to Federalist control, so that for the 3rd session, Pennsylvania's delegation was 21 Democratic-Republicans and 2 Federalists."

Dusky-headed parakeet;"Conurus weddellii Deville, 1851The dusky-headed parakeet (Aratinga weddellii), also known as Weddell's conure or dusky-headed conure in aviculture, is a small green Neotropical parrot with dusty grey head found in wooded habitats in the western Amazon basin of South America. Its range extends from southeastern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru and southwest Amazonian Brazil, to central Bolivia. It prefers semiopen habitats such as várzea, forest edge, and forest remnants, but can also be found in coffee plantations. It is generally common and its habitat preference makes it less vulnerable than many other Amazonian species. Consequently, it is considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN.This long-tailed species is generally green in color (both lutino and blue mutations are rare, but do exist in captivity) with a gray-brown head, a blue-tipped tail, and remiges that are dark gray from below, mainly blue from above. The bill is black, and it has a broad, bare, white (sometimes yellow-tinged) eye-ring. With a typical length of 25–28 cm (10–11 in) and a weight around 100 grams, it is slightly smaller than the sun conure. Many people call these conures minimacaws because they have skin near their beak and eyes, similar to the macaw.It is social, and usually found in pairs or small groups. It may even flock with different species of conures. When food is plentiful, it may form flocks of up to 100 members. It eats fruit, seeds, and flowers, and searches decaying wood for insect larvae. It also ingests mineral-rich soil, e.g., from a clay lick, as a supplement. A pair raises their offspring together, nesting in woodpecker holes in trees or arboreal termite nests.Consuming clay is believed to provide a mineral supplement and neutralise toxins in their diet. Their predators (along with many other neotropical parrots) include many birds of prey, monkeys, and in some cases, jaguars.They do well in captivity.[citation needed] They are fairly easy to breed if provided with a durable nest box, and will lay up to three clutches per year.[citation needed] They are known to be quiet, compared to other conure species[citation needed], but still very energetic and clownish, like most conures. These conures' lifespans range from 25 to 50 years, though their typical lifespans are usually 35–40 years.[citation needed]Recently, they have been sighted as a colony in coastal districts of Lima, Perú. They probably came as pets, and have settled in this city."
Niven's theorem;"In mathematics, Niven's theorem, named after Ivan Niven, states that the only rational values of θ in the interval 0° ≤ θ ≤ 90°  for which the sine of θ degrees is also a rational number are:[1]In radians, one would require that 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2, that x/π be rational, and that sin x be rational.  The conclusion is then that the only such values are sin 0 = 0, sin π/6 = 1/2, and sin π/2 = 1.The theorem appears as Corollary 3.12 in Niven's book on irrational numbers.[2]The theorem extends to the other trigonometric functions as well.[2] For rational values of  θ, the only rational values of the sine or cosine are 0, ±1/2, and ±1, the only rational values of the secant or cosecant are ±1 and ±2, and the only rational values of the tangent or cotangent are 0 and ±1.[3]"
1997–98 FA Premier League;"The 1997–98 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the sixth season of the FA Premier League. It saw Arsenal lift their first league title since 1991[2] and, in so doing, became only the second team to win 'The Double' for the second time. It was Arsenal's first full season under French manager Arsène Wenger, who became the third manager to win the Premier League. Wenger followed in the footsteps of Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish and, while both Ferguson and Dalglish were Scottish, Wenger was the first manager from outside the British Isles to win a league title in England.At the end of the 1997–98 FA Premier League season, a record total of nine English teams qualified for European competition.Premiership champions Arsenal and runners-up Manchester United qualified for the Champions League, while UEFA Cup places went to Liverpool, Leeds United, Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers. Qualifying for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup were Chelsea (as defending champions) and FA Cup runners-up Newcastle United. Crystal Palace, while finishing bottom, qualified for the Intertoto Cup.[3]The gap between the Premier League and Division One of the Football League was highlighted at the end of 1997–98 when all three newly promoted teams were relegated. Crystal Palace were confined to bottom place in the final table having won just two home games all season. Barnsley's first season in the top division ended in relegation, although they did reach the FA Cup quarter finals and knock out Manchester United in the Fifth Round. Bolton Wanderers went down on goal difference, with 17th place being occupied by Everton: despite preserving top flight football there for the 45th season running, Howard Kendall quit as manager at Goodison Park after his third spell in charge.Another mark of the gap was that the three relegated teams in the previous season took the top three places in the 1997–98 Football League. Had Sunderland not lost the play-off final to Charlton Athletic on penalty shootout, the 20 teams from 1998–99 Premier League would have been exactly the same as those in the 1996–97 Premier League.Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Bolton Wanderers (returning to the top flight after a season's absence), Barnsley (playing in the top flight for the first time) and Crystal Palace (playing in the top flight again after a two-year absence). They replaced Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest, who were relegated after top flight spells of one, two and three years respectively.A list of personnel and kits of the clubs in the 1997–98 FA Premier League."
EMD F2;"The EMD F2 was a freight-hauling diesel locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between July 1946 and November 1946. It succeeded the FT model in GM-EMD's F-unit sequence, and was replaced in turn by the F3. The F2 was in many respects a transitional type between those two, it kept the 1,350 hp (1,010 kW) rated D8 generator from the FT due to late development of the new D12 generator intended for the F3, but in a revised carbody design and internal layout that would be continued through the rest of the F-unit series. 74 cab-equipped lead A units and 30 cabless booster B units were produced.There are no reliable recognition features for an F2. They were built with what has become known as 'Type 1' side panels, with three portholes and no filter grilles, but this was carried over into early F3 production and in any case, could be changed later by the customer. Like some early F3s, they were built with small side numberboards on the nose. They, and all subsequent F-units, are readily distinguished from the FT by having two exhaust stacks instead of four, and by having no large overhang on the end of the B units, while the trucks were a little further away from the other ends. They also had four radiator fans at the center of the unit next to each other in line on the roof instead of two at each end. This external feature was the result of a major change in internal arrangement, the replacement of all mechanical and belt-drives for radiator fans and traction motor blowers with electric motors. Power for these accessories was produced by a new D14 three phase alternator built into the main DC generator, called a “companion alternator”. This device has been used in all later EMD road locomotives to the present.All F2's were scrapped, making them the only EMD F-unit model with no extant examples."
St Stephen's Church, Bristol;"St Stephen's Church in St Stephen's Avenue, is the parish church for the city of Bristol, England.It has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building.[1]It was built, on the site of an 11th-century church, in the 14th century and rebuilt around 1470. The tower and east window were paid for by John Shipward, four times Mayor of Bristol, who died in 1473,[2] the tower being built by the mason Benedict (or Benet) Crosse. The site was on the banks of the River Frome, which was diverted at around this time to create Bristol Harbour.[3] The clerestory was repaired after a storm in 1703. The aisle and east windows were restored in 1873.The tower measures approximately 18 ft by 20 ft at its base, and rises to a total height of 152 ft. It originally contained six bells but these have been replaced over the years and the number increased to twelve.[3] The tower is typical of Somerset churches, but with the addition of a "Gloucestershire crown" of arcaded battlements, pinnacles and open-work arcading.[4]The 15th-century brass eagle lectern and the iron sword rest by William Edney of about 1710 were moved to St Stephen's from St Nicholas church, which was damaged in the Bristol Blitz.[5]In 1885, a young man named Ramsay MacDonald took up a position as an assistant to Mordaunt Crofton, a Bristol clergyman who was attempting to establish a Boys' and Young Men's Guild at St Stephen's Church. It was in Bristol that Ramsay MacDonald joined his first Radical organisation, before moving to London in early 1886. Later, MacDonald became the first Labour Party Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.The St Stephen's Ringers have been a continuously active group of bellringers since 1574,[6] and have met annually at The Red Lodge since 1920 for their ceremonial dinner.[7]Edmund Blanket, a 14th-century clothier and wool merchant, has a tomb on the north side of the church.Arnaq and Kalicho, who were amongst the first North Americans to visit Britain (having been seized by Martin Frobisher), were buried at this church as "heathens" in 1577, within months of arriving in England.[8]A significant tomb is that of Martin Pring, who died at the age of 46 in 1627. He was a navigator, explorer and merchant and discovered what is now called Cape Cod Bay. The monument is draped with painted mermaids and mermen and verses to his exploits.[4] Sir Walter Tyddesley, who died in 1385, and Sir George Snigge also have ornate tombs in the church. Also commemorated, but this time in a wall-mounted plaque, is Robert Kitchin, who died in 1594, a donor of one of the famous bronze "nails" (merchants' counting tables) found outside The Exchange in Bristol.Parish records for St Stephen's church, Bristol are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. P. St S) (online catalogue) including baptism and marriage registers and a burial register. The archive also includes records of the incumbent, churchwardens, overseer of the poor, parochial church council, charities and vestry plus deeds."

Leucopogon cymbiformis;"Styphelia cymbiformis (A.Cunn. ex DC.) F.Muell.Leucopogon cymbiformis is a flowering plant in the family Ericaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a bushy or wiry shrub that typically grows to a height of 30–50 cm (12–20 in) and has more or less glabrous branches. Its leaves are erect, linear to lance-shaped and sharply-pointed, mostly 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) long. The flowers are arranged in short spikes, sometimes of only two or three flowers, with lance-shaped, leaf-like bracts, and bracteoles half as long as the sepals at the base of the spikes. The sepals are 2.5–3.0 mm (0.098–0.118 in) long and the petals slightly longer than the sepals, the lobes shorter than the petal tube.[2]Leucopogon cymbiformis was first formally described in 1839 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in his Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis from an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham.[3][4] The specific epithet (cymbiformis) means "boat-shaped", referring to the leaves.[5]This leucopogon grows in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Jarrah Forest bioregions of south-western Western Australia.[6]This Ericaceae article is a stub.

Oromandibular dystonia;"Oromandibular dystonia is a form of focal dystonia affecting the mouth, jaw and tongue, and in this disease it is hard to speak.[1] It is associated with bruxism.Botulinum toxin has been used in treatment.[2]Since the root of the problem is neurological, doctors have explored sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to "rewire" itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors such as Nancy Byl and Joaquin Farias has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and proprioceptive stimulation can induce neuroplasticity, making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost due to cervical dystonia, oromandibular dystonia and dysphonia.[3][4][5][6][7]This article about a disease, disorder, or medical condition is a stub.

Order of the Nation (political party);"Order of the Nation, previously known as LIDEM, is a political party in the Czech Republic, formed in 2012 as a breakaway party from Public Affairs (VV). The party supports greater individual freedom in economic and social spheres.[3]On 22 April 2012, the governing coalition of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) and TOP 09 dissolved their coalition with VV due to corruption accusations against the party leadership (especially Vít Bárta), raising the possibility that early elections would be held in June 2012.[4] However, shortly afterwards VV Deputy Karolína Peake led a breakaway faction of herself and seven other VV deputies who replaced VV in the coalition with ODS and TOP 09. The revised coalition controlled 100 seats (ODS=51, TOP09=41, LIDEM=8), and won a subsequent vote of confidence on 27 April 2012 by 105 to 93 votes, with additional support from some independent MPs.[5][6] The new party was launched as LIDEM on 3 May 2012.[7]In September 2012, the party applied for membership of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR),[8] and was accepted on 9 November 2012.[9]In December 2012, the Czech Prime Minister Petr Nečas sacked Karolína Peake as Defence Minister after only eight days in the post. He stated that he had lost confidence in her after she had begun her ministerial appointment by sacking one of the most senior officials in the Defence Ministry. This situation created a coalition crisis, as Peake announced that all LIDEM ministers consequently would withdraw on 10 January 2013, unless a solution could be found.[10] On 8 January, LIDEM's republican council guaranteed no ministers would withdraw and the party would still support the government, as long as they could renegotiate a new improved coalition agreement with TOP 09 and ODS.[11]On 7 August 2013, party leader Peake left the Chamber of Deputies building during a vote of confidence for the Jiří Rusnok government. The remainder of the LIDEM deputies remained in the building and voted against government. The next day, 8 August 2013, Karolína Peake announced her resignation as LIDEM leader.[12]LIDEM was renamed to VIZE2014 in March 2014. The party changed its name once again in June 2015 to Order of the Nation.As per May 2012, the LIDEM parliamentary group included eight members of the 200-member Chamber of Deputies.[13] Of these eight members, Martin Vacek and Radim Vysloužil were never members of the LIDEM party itself, but independents working with the party to form a stronger coalition group. The six MPs who were both members of the LIDEM parliamentary group and LIDEM party included:At the end of April 2013, Jana Suchá did not renew her membership fees for the following year, but the party announced on 4 August 2013 that despite this, she would stay in the party's parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies until the next election.[14] On 4 August 2013, it was also reported that the LIDEM parliamentary group still counted all original eight members, as the three independents (non-party members) committed themselves to vote along with the LIDEM party group in the Chamber of Deputies.[15]"

Hélène Iswolsky;"Hélène Iswolsky (Елена Александровна Извольская, born in 1896, Tegernsee, Germany, died in 1975, Cold Spring, New York, United States) was a Russian noblewoman, anti-communist political refugee, writer, translator and journalist. Raised Russian Orthodox, she was received into the Catholic Church in France and later became an oblate, taking the name Sister Olga.The American novelist Flannery O'Connor, who "used to go with her nephew", later described Iswolsky as "a Catholic of the Eastern Rite persuasion and sort of one-man Catholic ecumenical movement".[1]Hélène Iswolsky was born in 1896 into the family of Alexander Izvolsky, a Russian diplomat, and Countess Marguerite von Toll, a Baltic German noblewoman. Through her father, she was the niece of the Ober-Procurator of the Most Holy Synod, Pyotr Izvolskiy. Her father w as an ambassador of the Russian imperial government in different countries of Europe and Japan from 1894 to 1910, then Minister of Foreign Affairs and, from 1910 to 1917, Ambassador to France. When the First World War broke out, Isvolsky and her mother were in Konstanz, Grand Duchy of Baden, Imperial Germany, while traveling from Russia back to France. As Iswolsky's mother pleaded with the city's Herr Kommandant, a general in the Imperial German Army, for permission to leave the country, a messenger arrived, dismounted from a motorcycle, and shouted, "Germany has declared war on Russia!" The messenger then jumped back on his motorcycle and drove away. Iswolsky later wrote, "At the sound of that departure, it seemed to me that the very heavens were coming down over my head. I heard the crash of a world that would never again be the same." Even though Iswolsky and her mother were enemy nationals in time of war, the General explained that, as he had not yet officially received a report about the outbreak of war, he could still issue the necessary documents for both women to leave Germany for neutral Switzerland. Iswolsky and her mother finally arrived in Paris on August 3, 1914, the day that Germany declared war on France.[2]In Paris during the war, Iswolsky took care of the wounded and dying soldiers at the Hôpital Russe. Following the February Revolution, Iswolsky learned that she and all other Russian doctors and nurses working there had been under surveillance by the Paris offices of the Tsarist secret police, or Okhrana.[3]Isvolsky earned a living by working for French magazines, translating from Russian to French and English, and from French to Russian (among others, the philosophical works of Nicholas Berdyaev and Vyacheslav Ivanov). In 1923, she converted from Orthodoxy to the Russian Greek Catholic Church. The rite of joining the Catholic Church was in a Benedictine monastery, where she met two Russian-born nuns, Paula and Eustochia Komarov (mother and daughter). Following her conversion, Iswolsky regularly attended the Divine Liturgy at the Church of the Holy Trinity, located near the Porte d'Italie in Paris. She later praised the pastor, Mgr. Alexander Evreinov, in her memoirs. Evreinov offered the Byzantine Rite without the Latin Rite borrowings commonly added in Galicia, and "one might have thought oneself at an Orthodox service, except that prayers were offered for the Pope and our hierarchical head, the Archbishop of Paris". Iswolsky added that the chapel, although humble, "was decorated in the best of taste and according to the strictest Russian religious style, the iconostasis was the work of a Russian painter well-versed in ancient Eastern iconography. The central panel was a faithful copy of Rubleff's Trinity."[4]Iswolsky first met and befriended the poetess Marina Tsvetaeva at a literary dinner at Meudon. Iswolsky was approached on arrival and told, "I am Marina Tsvetaeva and I have a message for you from Boris Pasternak." Tvetaeva explained that Pasternak had read and enjoyed Iswolsky's translation into French of his poem about the Russian Revolution of 1905.[5]In 1931, Iswolsky went to Nagasaki in Japan where she was married and became Baroness R. Ungern-Sternberg. The marriage was unhappy and, in 1932, she returned to Paris and since then used her original name only.In 1941, Isvolsky moved from France to the United States. She stopped in New York City and, for the first time, received support from the Tolstoy Foundation. Here she met with Irma Manziarli who was born in Saint Petersburg and whose parents were German Protestants. During meetings at the home of Manziarli, she had the idea of publishing an ecumenical magazine. Among the founders of the magazine were people such as Vasily Janowski, the writer and doctor, Arthur Lourie, a composer and convert to Catholicism and Alexander Kazembek, party leader of the Mladorossi. The magazine title, The Third Hour, was taken from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2. 4-17). The first issue was published in 1946 in three versions: English, Russian and French. There were ten issues published in all. The last, in 1976 after Isvolsky's death, was dedicated to her. The purpose of the magazine was to unite all Christians—Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants. The magazine published the work of authors such as Simone Weil, Edith Stein, Mother Maria Skobtsova and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. It was attended by eminent scholars Jacques Maritain, Karl Barth and Jean Daniélou. When it became possible, Hélène visited Russia. Initially, with Dorothy Day she traveled by train from Moscow to Vladivostok.In 1961, she made a journey by car along the route Leningrad - Novgorod - Moscow - Vladimir - Tula - Eagle - Kharkiv - Poltava  - Kiev. In Moscow, she visited the tomb of Vladimir Solovyov, where she collected some soil (in December 1975 in Tivoli, New York, the soil was placed in her grave). In the United States, she joined the social movement Catholic Worker. In her 60s, Isvolsky lived at times in Tivoli. Not far from Tivoli was a small Benedictine monastery and she began to take an active part in its spiritual life. In 1972, the monastery moved about 50 miles south to Cold Spring, New York, and in summer 1974, she moved from New York City to Cold Spring to be closer. The brothers helped her maintain a library, an extensive archive. Iswolsky died on Christmas Eve 1975, in a hospital near Cold Spring. Shortly before her death, she became an oblate of the Traditionalist Catholic Benedictine Abbey of Regina Laudis, taking the name Olga."

2003–04 Vancouver Canucks season;"The 2003–04 Vancouver Canucks season was the Canucks' 34th NHL season. It was the first time since the Northwest Division was created that a team other than the Colorado Avalanche won the division title.The Canucks began their season with the top line of Brendan Morrison, Markus Naslund and Todd Bertuzzi. The Sedin twins continued to develop and began seeing some success initially being paired with Jason King. With their initial team chemistry, Jason King plotting 12 goals and being named NHL Rookie of the Month in November. The trio briefly formed "The Mattress Line" (Two Twins and a King). The season looked promising with the Canucks being near the top of the standings. When February came along, the Canucks narrowly defeated the Colorado Avalanche 1-0 but it came at a cost with Avalanche forward Steve Moore hitting Canucks captain Markus Naslund resulting in Naslund getting a concussion and Moore not penalized. Many Canucks vowed revenge against Moore (notably Brad May).  When the two teams met again in Denver on March 3rd (with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman in attendance), there were no incidents and both teams skated to a 5-5 draw.  On March 8th, however, in Vancouver, everything fell apart. The Avalanche jumped out to a 5-0 lead and Brad May cut the deficit to 5-2 while at the same time taunting Avalanche goalie David Aebischer after each goal. Bertuzzi made it his personal mission to go after Steve Moore and after trying (and failing) to incite him, sucker punched him and falling on top of him. Bertuzzi would be suspended the rest of the regular season and playoffs. The Canucks had some difficulty recovering from this incident and managed to win the Northwest Division on the final day of the regular season, their first division championship since the 1992-93 season.Note: CR = Conference rank, GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime loss, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, Pts = Points         Bolded teams qualified for the playoffs.Divisions: CE – Central, PA – Pacific, NW – NorthwestP –  Clinched Presidents Trophy, Y –  Clinched Division, X –  Clinched Playoff spotAfter splitting the first two games in Vancouver, Dan Cloutier was injured midway through Game 3 in Calgary. With backup Johan Hedberg playing in relief, Vancouver would also split Games 3 and 4 in Calgary. Alex Auld took over in goal starting in Game 5, which the Canucks lost 2-1. Facing elimination in Game 6, Brendan Morrison scored the winner in the third overtime period to force a Game 7 in Vancouver. In the series-deciding game, the Canucks found themselves down a goal and on the penalty kill in the last minute. With Auld on the bench for the extra attacker, winger Matt Cooke tied the game with 5.7 seconds left to force overtime. However, with Ed Jovanovski still in the penalty box, former Canuck Martin Gelinas eliminated the Canucks on the power play.  Win (2 points)  Loss (0 points)  Tie (1 point)  Overtime loss (1 point)  Win  LossThe Canucks were involved in the following transactions from June 10, 2003, the day after the deciding game of the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, through June 7, 2004, the day of the deciding game of the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals.[12]Vancouver's draft picks at the 2003 NHL Entry Draft held at the Gaylord Entertainment Center in Nashville, Tennessee.[69]"

Jaklin Kornfilt;"Jaklin Kornfilt is a theoretical linguist and professor at Syracuse University who is well known for her contributions to the fields of syntax, morphology, Turkish language and grammar, and Turkic language typology.[1] [2]Kornfilt graduated from German High School in Istanbul, Turkey. She then graduated from Heidelberg University with a bachelor's degree in applied linguistics and translation studies in 1970. She obtained a Master of Arts degree in theoretical linguistics from Harvard University in 1980. She earned a PhD again in theoretical linguistics from the same university in 1985.[3][4] Her PhD thesis was "Case Marking, Agreement, and Empty Categories in Turkish".[5]After graduation, Kornfilt began to work as an instructor at Syracuse University in 1983.[6] She became professor of linguistics in 2003 in the Department of Languages, Literatures and Linguistics (LLL).[3] At Syracuse University, she is also former Director of the Linguistic Studies Program and of the Computational Linguistics Program.[7]She also organized and led a linguistics working group of The Central New York Humanities Corridor, an interdisciplinary partnership with Syracuse University, Cornell University, and the University of Rochester from 2005 to 2010.[8]Kornfilt was awarded the Humboldt Research Award by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Bamberg in 2010.[9][10]In 2021, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cyprus for 'her contributions to theoretical and Turkish linguistics'.[6]Kornfilt is the author of Turkish (1997), a comprehensive overview of the grammatical properties of the Turkish language. This work is renowned for its near-exhaustive survey of the syntactic and morphological systems of Turkish and is considered the major successor to Turkish-language descriptive grammars of G.L. Lewis’ Turkish Grammar (1967) and Robert Underhill's Turkish Grammar (1976).[11][12] Her work provided a thorough investigation of the syntactical and morphological properties of Turkish and defining its key typological features and universal characteristics.[13]Her work is a contribution to the Descriptive Grammars series by the Routledge publishing company. The series overviews a variety of languages through the lens of theoretical and descriptive analyses, using a framework called the Questionnaire as a structural tool for comparing grammars across language types.[13] More specifically, the Questionnaire surveys language features in a manner that is:Kornfilt's text is one of the first Turkish grammars to "incorporate overtly the native speaker's linguistic intuitions into its language description,",[13] as Kornfilt indicates various degrees to which ungrammatical sentences may be judged to be ungrammatical. As she explains in the preface, "[a]nother unusual feature of this book, and especially of the syntax chapter, is probably the fact that shadings of grammaticality or acceptability are noted, rather than reflecting an all-or-nothing approach".[11]Structure of TurkishIn the preface, Kornfilt traces the genealogical history of Turkish as the Turkic language with the most speakers and a member of the Altaic language family. She notes that Turkish was written in Arabic script from the beginning of its history in the Anatolian peninsula, until its orthography was converted to the Latin alphabet following the language reforms of 1928, upon the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. She emphasizes that this Modern Standard Turkish is the focus of the book.[13]In five chapters, she surveys Syntax, Morphology, Phonology, Ideophones and Interjections, and Lexicon. With a total of 575 pages, the book devotes an overwhelming majority of attention to Syntax and Morphology. Given that even the Morphology chapter often describes syntactical properties, Kornfilt is primarily interested in the syntax of Turkish:[13]Ch 1. "Syntax": 211 pagesCh 2. "Morphology": 270 pagesCh 3. "Phonology": 32 pagesCh 4. "Ideophones and Interjections": 3 pagesCh 5. "Lexicon": 16 pages"Syntax" and "Morphology"Across sixteen subparts, the chapter surveys aspects of Turkish syntax: sentence types, subordination, internal sentence structures, phrasal units, negation, anaphora, reflexives, reciprocals, comparative constructions, equatives, possessive constructions, Yes-no questions, question-word questions, questions in coordinate structures, means of expressing emphasis, topic, movement processes, and word classes.A notable innovation of Kornfilt's syntax is observation of the relationship of the palatal glide [y] to copula and auxiliary word classes. Previous grammars such as those of Lewis (1967) and Underhill (1976) identified -DIr, -IDI, -ImIş as "copula" or "auxiliary".[13] Kornfilt argues that the palatal glide [y] belongs in this category as well, as it "shows up after a predicate noun, adjective, or adverbial that has a stem-final vowel, this glide precedes the tense suffix, if there is one, and agreement suffix if there is no tense".[11]Additionally, Kornfilt denies the existence of a separate topic marker in Turkish syntax. This contradicts the view that the form -ise (copula + conditional) or the particle de are topic markers, as in the following sentences:[13](Sentence 1)'''Fasulye-yi   ise     en      çok   Ayşe  sev-iyor.Bean-Acc.   Cop    Supl   most  Ayşe  love-pres.'As for beans, Ayşe likes them the most.'(Sentence 2)Fasulye-yi  de     en       çok    Ayşe   sev-iyor.Bean-Acc.   Part   Supl    most   Ayşe   love-pres.'As for beans, Ayşe likes them the most.'Written for the book, The World’s Language Families (1990), Kornfilt's chapter on “Turkish and Turkic Languages”[14] is her secondary signature work. Continuing in her contributions to language typology and comparative grammar, Kornfilt highlights the key linguistic features that make Turkic languages unique. The chapter is a highly cited source of comparative linguistics with regards to Turkish.“General and Historical Background”Kornfilt provides the background of Turkish and Turkic languages. She specifies how Turkic languages share similar features, including vowel harmony, agglutinative morphology, verb-final word order, and nominalised subordinate clauses. She argues that because Turkic languages share these features, it is often difficult to count the total number of completely separate Turkic languages. Additionally, she introduces a controversy about the external genetic relationships of the Turkic family. She describes that while the majority opinion agrees that Turkic languages belong to the overarching Altaic language family, along with Mongolian and Tungusic languages, outlier perspectives claim Korean, Japanese, and even Uralic languages to be Altaic as well.With regards to the geographical groupings of Turkic languages, Kornfilt acknowledges that there is no broad consensus on their classifications. Ultimately, she chooses to classify the Modern Standard Turkish spoken in the Republic of Turkey as part of Anatolian dialect of the Osman language group, which is part of the larger South-West Oyuz group of Turkic languages.“Phonology and Orthography”Kornfilt highlights the phonological characteristics of Turkish. She begins by remarking on the symmetry of Turkish vowels, as there are four pairs of high and non-high vowels, varying in backness and rounding. She states that non-high vowels can only be round if they are in a word-initial syllable. She argues that the most prominent property of Turkish vowels their adherence to vowel harmony, as they regularly assimilate to one another to match according to backness and rounding.Kornfilt also explores the orthographic characteristics of written Turkish. While Turkish adopted the Latin script following the writing reforms of 1928, there are a few changes that the Republic of Turkey made in the characterizations of letters. As Kornfilt describes: "Instead of -i, the sign used for the high back non-round vowel, we find ı, i.e. a dotless i. The difference between the two non-round high vowels is signalled in the same way for capital letters: I . for the front, I for the back, high non-round vowel...Other letters that don’t correspond to the familiar phonetic symbols are the following: c for [j], ç for [č], ş for [š], j for [ž]".Additionally, Kornfilt explores other features of Turkish phonology: syllable-final oral stop devoicing, the k/0 alternation, word-final liquid devoicing, morpheme-initial voicing assimilation, vowel harmony, labial attraction, and word-final stress.“Morphology”Kornfilt begins by commenting on the highly agglutinative and suffixing nature of Turkish. Virtually all morphemes in Turkish carry suffix morphemes and an explicit function. The only prefixing operation in Turkish is the intensification of adjectives and adverbs, via the reduplication of the first syllable and the addition of a consonant: e.g. beyaz 'white', bembeyaz 'completely white', çabuk 'fast', çarçabuk 'very fast'"[3].She goes on to survey the most productive suffixes of Turkish, along with the rules governing their order when combined. More specifically, she surveys:NP-MovementKornfilt has also contributed to understanding of the Government and Binding theory originally proposed by Chomsky. Kornfilt asserts CP-transparency, as proposed by generative theory, in Turkish syntax and refutes the role of restructuring in constructions that violate clause-dependent government rules.[15] Specifically, she focuses on NP-movement of an embedded object to matrix subject position, a specific kind of construction in Turkish that she notes for its "non-local application of an otherwise local process".[15] The constructions are called “Infinitival Double Passives” (IDPs), and are characterized as follows:[15]The following are some example sentences of Turkish IDPs:[15](Sentence 1)üniversite-ler (polis tarafından) kuşat-ıl-mak               iste-n-diuniversity-pl.    police by               surround-Pass-Infin.   want-Pass-past'The universities were wanted to be surrounded by the police'(Sentence 2)üniversite-ler (polis tarafından) kuşat-ıl-mağ-a                    başla-n-dıuniversity-pl.     police by              surround-Pass-Infin.-Dat.    begin-Pass-past'The universities were begun to be surrounded by the police'(Sentence 3)üniversite-ler (polis tarafından) kuşat-ıl-mağ-a                     çalış-ıl-dıuniversity-pl.    police by               surround-Pass-Infin.-Dat.     try-Pass-past'The universities were tried to be surrounded by the police'The following are active counterparts of the above Turkish IDPs that involve Control:[15](Sentence 4)polis(i)     [PRO(i) üniversite-ler-i        kuşat-mak]       iste-dipolice                    university-pl.-Acc.     surround-Infin.  want-past'The police wanted to surround the universities'(Sentence 5)polis(i)   [PRO(i) üniversite-ler-i         kuşat-mağ]-a            başla-dıpolice                  university-pl.-Acc.     surround-Infin.-Dat.   begin-past'The police begun to surround the universities'(Sentence 6)polis(i)    [PRO(i) üniversite-ler-i                 kuşat-mağ]-a             çalış-tıpolice                  university-pl.-Acc.               surround-Infin.-Dat.    try-past'The police tried to surround the universities'Kornfilt claims that while IDPs in other languages can normally be explained by Exceptional Case Marking (ECM), the ECM does not operate in Turkish—or, at least, it does not operate in the way that would explain the anomaly of non-local, cross-clausal rule application demonstrated by Turkish IDPs. Accordingly, Kornfilt proposes the question: “If IDPs are not explainable by ECM, why are they grammatical” in Turkish?[15] Her solution: The three "IDP" verbs are triggers of another type of Transparency of maximal projection, purely descriptively speaking, instead of a CP that dominates a verbal IP, what becomes transparent is a CP that dominates a "nominal" IP rather than a "verbal" IP.[15]In other words, the same CP-Transparency found in factive contexts that renders embedded subjects under the rule of government via the matrix verb is also present in non-factive contexts as well, such as in her Turkish examples. Her proposal links this CP-Transparency phenomenon to the traditional effects of S-bar Deletion in that the ‘offending’ trace in embedded subject position is now properly governed by the main verb and is saved from violating the [Empty Category Principle].[15] Consequently, she dismisses ECP as a satisfying account of Turkish grammar. Additionally, she dismisses the traditional explanation of “Restructuring” in the case of Turkish IDPs because it violates the Projection Principle of Chomsky's Government and Binding theory, instead, she suggests “CP-Transparency” as a viable alternative explanation that maintains a consistent commitment to Government and Binding and accounts for the cross-clausal application of mono-clausal government found in Turkish IDPs.[15]Disagreement on Kornfilt's accountWayne Harbert opposed Kornfilt in his review of her article,[16] claiming that the Turkish examples Kornfilt used are only “an apparent, not a real instance of non-local application of NP-movement”.[16] He argued that Kornfilt had a non-problem on her hands, mistakenly giving an explanation for something that had a simpler, more viable reasoning. He stated that Kornfilt was incorrect to say that the passive morphology she observed in main and subordinate clauses in Turkish are a “result of any particular linkage between the INFL [Inflectional] nodes of the two clauses”, rather, this passivity is realized in the main clause “when the embedded clause is passive by the fact that the failure of the passivized object to get case by moving to matrix subject position would result in ill-formedness”.[16] Harbert presented various case studies that demonstrated various degrees of relaxed government rules from several languages, with some grammars allowing occasional exceptions to the rule and other grammars adopting non-standard treatment of structure effectively minimize the syntactic distance between the related elements without movement”.[16] In effect, Harbert attempted to minimize the novelty of Kornfilt's Turkish IDPs by presenting cases of non-local government abnormalities in other languages.Properties of Scrambling in TurkishIn her article, "Scrambling, Subscrambling, and Case in Turkish" (2003),[17] Kornfilt examines the phenomenon of scrambling in Turkish grammar. She examines the role that specificity plays in the interactions between scrambling, subscrambling, and typology of Case. She also observes the extent to which the Specificity Effect is an autonomous, independent principle of grammar. She demonstrates that the Specificity Effect is actually a by-product of other syntactic principles, particularly the Condition on Extraction Domains (CED), which she suggests is itself a by-product of Subajency. Additionally, Kornfilt demonstrates that CED is insufficient in explaining features of Turkish, especially those involving with structural Case.[17] As an alternative, Kornfilt suggests that syntactic incorporation of N's into verbs provides a better account of scrambling in Turkish than CED.Against scrambling as an instance of "Move-Alpha"In her article, "Against scrambling as an instance of Move-alpha" (1994),[18] Kornfilt surveys and weighs the popular understandings of scrambling. Namely, she acknowledges two major views about scrambling: according to the first, "scrambling is an instance of Chomsky-adjoining an XP (NP, PP, to a more limited extant also AP or ADV) to VP or to IP (perhaps also AP)" as an instance of movement to an A'-position,[18] the second view proposes that certain sub-cases of scrambling are instances of A-movement.[18] Kornfilt argues that scrambling cannot be explained by any movement account at all. Instead, she proposes a base-generation account that is "not committed to the inadequacies of a non-configurational account of German syntax".[18] She makes use of morphosyntactic and lexical properties that are independently attested in the language.Direct ObjectsIn her article, "The case of the direct object in Turkish: Semantics, syntax and morphology" (2005),[19] Kornfilt observes the relationship between semantic parameters and morphological constraints in determining the distribution of the accusative case marker -(y)I in Turkish.[19] She notes that there are two mainstream understandings of the accusative marker. The first considers the marker as an instance of Differentiated Object Marking (DOM). The caveat of this perspective is that it assumes that the case suffix marks a direct object if it is too similar to an "archetypical subject".[19] The second perspective is based on the observation that the accusative marker is closely related to the direct object's specificity, instead of to the similarity of the direct object to a typical subject. Kornfilt argues that neither of these perspectives give a satisfying explanation for the distribution of the accusative case marker. Alternatively, Kornfilt insists that the suffix explicitly indicates specificity under certain morpho-syntactic conditions, instead of a mere contrast to the subject.[19] This proposal is a more flexible notion of specificity in terms of "referentially anchored indefinite NPs".[19] This ultimately means that the accusative case marker can indicate the referential property of the direct object, including specificity, according to certain morphological environments in a predictable manner, in other contexts, it is not a reliable indicator of properties like specificity.[19]"

Rancilio;"Rancilio is an espresso machine manufacturer, founded in 1927 by Roberto Rancilio in Parabiago, Italy.Rancilio's earliest machine was 'La Regina' – a vertical boiler machine, similar to the original Bezzera and Victoria Arduino devices in function and gilded 'Belle Epoque' styling.In 1950, Rancilio released a horizontal boiler machine, the Invicta Horizzontal, showing evidence of the postwar shift toward spare, modern styling. The machine however, still used the same forced-steam brewing method from the early 20th century. By 1953, Rancilio adopted lever piston technology introduced by Gaggia. In 1957, Rancilio released a model which automated the lever process, the H/L Automatica. The company followed new technological trends towards continuous deliver brewing introduced by Faema in 1961. In 1965, Rancilio commissioned design work from industrial designer Marco Zanuso, beginning with the Rancilio Z8, and continuing with the Z9 in 1974.  Rancilio continued with several Z-series machines, with the Z11 being the last.  The S-series machine would become popular in the 1990s, and become well known in the North American marketplace.[1]In 1997, Rancilio created a home kitchen-sized espresso machine based on their commercial offerings. This was initially only available as a thank-you gift to importers and vendors of Rancilio's restaurant-grade coffee machines. This machine was later sold to consumers as the Silvia.[2][3][4] The Silvia is a one group machine with a vibratory pump from ULKA and a single brass boiler that's controlled by 3 thermostats for both steam and hot water. It is frequently sold with its companion Rocky grinder that is available in doserless and dosered models with stepped settings.[5]In 2001, Rancilio revamped their lineup, introducing the basic Epoca, and the Classe series. In 2011, they introduced a new advanced brewing system for the Classe 9 called Xcelsius, which gives precise control of water temperature during the brewing cycle.[6]Rancilio made an attempt at a super-automatic machine, the Classe 12, and used cafes in Borders bookstores as a test market. It was deemed a failure, recalled, and abandoned. They subsequently purchased the Swiss Egro brand of super-automatic machines and have built a presence in that market with their Egro One.In October 2013 Rancilio was acquired by Ali group.[7]Coordinates: 45°31′51″N 8°56′45″E﻿ / ﻿45.53083°N 8.94583°E﻿ / 45.53083, 8.94583"
Jean Chapdelaine;"Joseph Marc Antoine Jean Chapdelaine (1914 - 2005),[1][2] more commonly known as Jean Chapdelaine or J. A. Chapdelaine,[3] was a Canadian diplomat who was ambassador to Sweden, Finland, Brazil, Sudan and Egypt in the 1950s and 1960s.[4] He was also an important figure in the development of Quebec Government Offices and has been called the 'Father of Quebec diplomacy'.[5]Chapdelaine attended Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1934, studying PPE at Hertford College, Oxford.[1][6][7]Chapdelaine joined the Department for External Affairs in 1937.[7] In 1941, he was third secretary at the Canadian embassy in Washington, D.C., working for Ambassador Leighton McCarthy.[8] Chapdelaine attended the third session of the Food and Agriculture Organization conference in 1947,[9] and the second session of the interim commission of the World Health Organization in 1948.[10]From January to July 1950, Chapdelaine was the chargé d'affaires to Ireland.[2] From 1955 to 1959 he was the Canadian ambassador to Finland and Sweden, from 1959 to 1963 he was the ambassador to Brazil,[11] and from 1963 to 1964 he was ambassador to Sudan and Egypt (then still called the United Arab Republic).[3][2] From 1965, Chapdelaine became Quebec's delegate-general in Paris as part of one of the province's Government Offices, although he had hoped he would be nominated as ambassador to France.[12][13] He held the post until 1976 when he returned to Canada to work as an adviser in the office of Premier René Lévesque. He later became Quebec's delegate-general in Brussels before retiring as a diplomat in the 1980s.[5]Chapdelaine received several medals and honours:[7]Chapdelaine was also given an honourary doctorate in social sciences from the Université Laval in 1975.[7] Since 2006, the university has awarded the Rita and Jean Chapdelaine Scholarship in remembrance of him and his wife.[15][16]"

Shiloh House (Benton Harbor, Michigan);"Shiloh House in Benton Harbor, Michigan was built in Queen Anne style by the House of David Colony.  It was built in 1910 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.[1]The House of David was founded in 1903 by Benjamin Purnell. Believers came to this site in Benton Harbor to join the commune. To accommodate the growing number of converts, a number of buildings were erected around this site. One of the members of the commune built a machine to construct cement blocks, which were then used to construct the buildings. Shiloh House, constructed in 1910, was the first building to use blocks from the commune itself.[3]Reportedly, Purnell's favorite girls were kept in this building, until the details were revealed in the 1920s. Afterward, it has been used for office and dormitory space.[3]Shiloh House is a 2+1⁄2-story Queen Anne building constructed of cement blocks. It is composed of a main section in the front and two equally sized sections to the rear, connected to the main section with covered archways. It has a hip roof, round turrets, and a center porch able topped with a dome and finial. Balconies on the second and third floor have curved archways between thecolumns and decorative wooden railings.[3]"

Claude Jourdan;"Claude Jourdan (18 June 1803, in Heyrieux – 12 February 1873, in Lyon) was a French zoologist and paleontologist.In Lyon he was a professor of zoology to the Faculté des sciences, and a professor of comparative anatomy at the École des Beaux-Arts. From 1832 to 1869 he was director of the Musée d'histoire naturelle - Guimet in Lyons.[1][2]As a zoologist, he conducted studies of living and extinct vertebrates, including Proboscidea (elephants and their ancestors). In 1840–48 he is credited with uncovering 2000 fossils at various excavation sites in France.[2] As a taxonomist, he described Acerodon, a genus of Old World fruit bats, and Hemigalus, a monospecific genus associated with the banded palm civet, Hemigalus derbyanus. He also classified the following mammal species:In 1839 Jules Bourcier named the rufous-shafted woodstar, Chaetocercus jourdanii, after him. It is sometimes referred to as "Jourdan's woodstar".[4]"
Woodturning;"Woodturning is the craft of using a wood lathe with hand-held tools to cut a shape that is symmetrical around the axis of rotation. Like the potter's wheel, the wood lathe is a simple mechanism that can generate a variety of forms. The operator is known as a turner, and the skills needed to use the tools were traditionally known as turnery. In pre-industrial England, these skills were sufficiently difficult to be known as 'the misterie' of the turners guild. The skills to use the tools by hand, without a fixed point of contact with the wood, distinguish woodturning and the wood lathe from the machinist's lathe, or metal-working lathe.Items made on the lathe include tool handles, candlesticks, egg cups, knobs, lamps, rolling pins, cylindrical boxes, Christmas ornaments, bodkins, knitting needles, needle cases, thimbles, pens, chessmen, spinning tops, legs, spindles, and pegs for furniture, balusters and newel posts for architecture, baseball bats, hollow forms such as woodwind musical instruments, urns, sculptures, bowls, platters, and chair seats. Industrial production has replaced many of these products from the traditional turning shop. However, the wood lathe is still used for decentralized production of limited or custom turnings. A skilled turner can produce a wide variety of objects with five or six simple tools. The tools can be reshaped easily for the task at hand.In many parts of the world, the lathe has been a portable tool that goes to the source of the wood or adapts to temporary workspaces. 21st-century turners restore furniture, continue folk-art traditions, produce custom architectural work, and create fine crafts for galleries. Woodturning appeals to people who like to work with their hands, find pleasure in problem-solving, or enjoy the tactile and visual qualities of wood.Wood lathes work with either reciprocating or continuous revolution. The reciprocating lathe is powered by a bow or a spring, rotating the wood first in one direction, and then in the other. The turner cuts on just one side of the rotation, as with the pole lathe. The reciprocating lathe may be human-powered with a bow, as well as with spring mechanisms. The reciprocating lathe, while primitive technology requiring considerable dexterity to operate, is capable of excellent results in skilled hands. For example, reciprocating bow lathes are still used to turn beads for the Arabian lattice windows called Meshrebeeyeh that so charmed Holtzapffel in the 1880s.[1]Continuous revolution of the workpiece can be human-powered with a treadle wheel, or achieved with water, steam, or electric power. The style of cutting does not have the pause required by the reciprocating lathe's rotation. Even with continuous revolution, however, the turner controls the contact of tool and wood entirely by hand. The cutters are not fixed, nor advanced automatically, as with the metal-working lathe.The nature of wood defines woodturning techniques. The orientation of the wood grain, relative to the axis of the lathe, affects the tools and techniques used by the woodturner. In spindle turning, the grain runs lengthwise along the lathe bed, as if a log were mounted in the lathe. Grain is thus always perpendicular to the direction of rotation under the tool. In bowl turning, the grain runs at right angles to the axis, as if a plank were mounted across the chuck. When a bowl blank rotates, the angle that the grain makes with the cutting tool continually changes between the easy cuts to two places per rotation where the tool is cutting across the grain and even upwards across it. This varying grain angle limits some of the tools that may be used and requires additional skill from the turner.Moisture content affects both the ease of cutting wood and the final shape of the work when it dries. Wetter wood cuts easily with a continuous ribbon of shavings that are relatively dust-free. However, the wet wood moves as it dries. shrinking less along the grain. These variable changes may add the illusion of an oval bowl, or draw attention to features of the wood. Dry wood is necessary for turnings that require precision, as in the fit of a lid to a box, or in forms where pieces are glued together.The character of the wood creates other challenges for the woodturner. Turners of hardwoods and ivory select different tools than those used for cutting softwoods. Voids in the wood require higher lathe speeds, fillers, or extra safety precautions. Although other woodworkers value tight, straight grain, woodturners often search out the unusual wood from roots, defects, or diseased portions of trees.The craft of woodturning is preserved and advanced by a community of practitioners. Until the 1970s, an apprentice system in the U.K., and Industrial Arts education in the U.S., preserved many of the traditional skills of the craft. Between 1975 and 1985, industrial arts teachers, hobbyists, artists, collectors, and tool suppliers developed the symposium format for exchange of information about the craft.[2] This community was a kind of prototype for the artisan-based maker culture active in the 21st century. The community organizes regional, national, and international symposiums, publishes journals, and hosts travelling experts at club events. Most publications and DVDs are of the DIY variety, including numerous YouTube videos.The archaeological record of woodturning is limited to illustrations because wood is a fiber prone to rot. Egyptian monuments illustrate a strap used by a helper to rotate the lathe while another worker cut the wood. Early bow lathes and strap lathes were developed and used in Egypt and Rome.[3] The Chinese, Persians, and Arabs had their own variations of the bow lathe.[4] Early lathe workers would sometimes use their bare feet to hold cutting tools in place while using their hand to power the lathe. Bow lathes continue in use right up to the present day, and much of our information about them comes from watching turners use them.[5] Between 500 and 1500 A.D., turned wooden vessels served as the everyday bowls and cups of most of the population of Europe. Our knowledge of these humble vessels comes from bowls excavated from shipwrecks, such as the Mary Rose and the Oseberg burial ship, or dug out of deep wells, where they were preserved in an anaerobic environment. Much of this ware was turned from green wood on a spring pole lathe.[6] Finely crafted drinking bowls, known as mazers, were produced in very limited quantities from dry wood, then decorated with silver-gilt central bosses and rims.[7]As early as 1568, a separate fly wheel powered a lathe via a drive belt.[8] A master would cut the wood while an apprentice turned the crank on a huge wheel, often several feet in diameter. This was a continuous revolution lathe, which led to adaptation to external power sources such as water, steam, and electricity. This lathe evolved into the 'queen of machine tools' which made it possible to turn parts for other machinery.[9] The Holtzapffels developed ornamental turning lathes from the continuous revolution lathe combined with metal-working innovations like the automatic slide rest. These lathes worked from geared patterns to cut designs in hardwoods such as ebony. They were favored as a hobby by European princes, meriting a mention by Tolstoy in War and Peace (1869).[10]Woodturners in London organized into a guild as early as 1310 on Wood Street. By 1347, the Turners Company was assigned responsibility for regulating weights and measures by the Mayor.[11] By 1591, they built their own Hall. The Company governed the apprentice system, and established pricing for goods. In 1604, they were incorporated as the Worshipful Company of Turners of London.[12] Outside of London, the craft was decentralized and unregulated. Itinerant turners known as Bodgers set up temporary pole lathes near the source of wood for turning furniture parts.In the 19th and early 20th century, woodturners in England worked in Turning Shops,[13] usually within the master-apprentice system. In Germany and Russia, woodturning was concentrated in villages which had a specialty, such as turning toys. Bow lathes and pole lathes continued in use for decentralized, one-man production of architectural elements and bowls in many parts of the world. In the US, woodturning was part of the curriculum of industrial arts taught in public schools—often a prerequisite for classes in building furniture. The 'problems' from textbooks included both tool management skills, and assignments to turn objects such as gavels, darning eggs, boxes, trays, candlesticks, lamps, and legs for furniture.[14][15]Woodturning skills were used by patternmakers in the making of prototypes and shapes for casting molds used in foundries during the 19th and 20th century. They worked very slowly to achieve precision, using enormous patternmaker lathes and slow-cutting scraping tools.[16]Woodturning has always had a strong hobbyist presence. In the 1970s, an explosion of interest in hobby woodturning in the English-speaking world sparked a revival in the craft. Dr. Dale Nish travelled to England to recruit teachers, tools, and techniques from the last of the apprentice-trained woodturners.[17] A few years later, Canadian Stephen Hogbin spent a year in Australia, pushing the limits of the craft through changes in scale and design.[18] Industrial arts teachers used their institutional affiliation to create seminars, publish books, and foster research. The tool industry identified a new market for lathes and turning tools. A small group of serious collectors invested in the increasingly sculptural explorations of woodturners. It is unusual that woodturning never established a strong foothold in university departments of art and design. Instead, practitioners of the craft have become adept at learning from demonstrations, private classes, regional meetings, their own published journals, and internet technologies. Some artists began as woodturners, and moved into more sculptural work, experimenting with super object forms and other fine craft concepts.[19] The Center for Art in Wood, founded in 1986 as The Wood Turning Center, houses a collection in Philadelphia with over 1,000 objects from international artists[20] as well as a research library and gallery.[21] Other turners have chosen an artisan-based focus on traditional work, custom work, and the pleasure of studio practice.Complex forms made on a wood lathe develop from surprisingly few types of cuts: parting, planing, bead, cove, and hollowing. Parting separates the wood from the holding device, or establishes depth cuts. Planing is done with a tool in which the bevel below the cutting edge supports wood fibers, just as in a typical wood planer. Beads are a convex shape relative to the cylinder, and coves are a concave shape. Hollowing techniques are a combination of drilling and scooping out materials. The woodturner is at liberty to choose from a variety of tools for all of these techniques, and the quality of the cuts improves with practice wielding the tool selected. Turners rely upon three points of contact making any type of cut: the tool presses down on the tool rest, and against the woodturner's body before contacting the surface of the wood, most often with a bevel edge riding the surface of the wood. The objective is to position the tool correctly so that the wood comes around to the cutting edge, generating a thin shaving without chipping or tearing out sections of the wood. Woodturners prefer to use very clean cuts to minimize the time spent with abrasives. When it is necessary to sand the piece, they do so on the lathe, using abrasives held by hand, in an inertial sander which revolves with the wood's own rotation, or with power tools—drills or right-angle drills. The lathe also becomes a useful holding device for carving, burning, texturing, coloring, and finishing the form.The wood rotates between the headstock of the lathe which includes the drive mechanism and the tailstock support, which only rotates if its center is 'live' or supported by a rotating holding device. The headstock end may use points or spurs which are driven into the wood. This type of turning is described as 'between centers.' The headstock spindle may also use a cup, collet, or a scroll chuck to hold a tenon on the workpiece which will be removed in the finished product. The wood can also be screwed or glued to a faceplate—a strong disk that is threaded to mount on the headstock's spindle. The use of a chuck or faceplate allows the woodturner to forego tailstock support for the rotating wood. This type of secure holding system is essential for hollowing bowls or hollow forms. Turning tools are generally made from carbon steel, high speed steel (HSS), and more recently tungsten carbide. Comparing the three types, high speed steel tools maintain their edge longer, requiring less frequent sharpening than carbon steel, but not as long as tungsten carbide. Tungsten carbide tools typically consist of scraping tools with the disposable carbide insert attached to the tool. The harder the type of high speed steel used, the longer the edge will maintain sharpness. Tungsten carbide inserts are generally thought of as disposable, but they can be sharpened with diamond abrasives. Modern cutting and scraping tools can also be coated with titanium nitride to improve wear characteristics.Woodturning tools must be sharpened more frequently than other edged woodworking tools to maintain a clean cut because the wood passes at great speed. Sharpening is usually accomplished with the aid of mechanical devices such as powered sharpening wheels and abrasives. This sharpening process requires either skill of the craftsman, or one of the many available sharpening jigs, which facilitate maintaining a specific bevel on the tool. As with any mechanical sharpening method, overheating or blueing is a danger to be avoided as it will ruin the steel's temper, rendering the steel too soft to maintain a sharp edge. When this happens, the blued area must then be ground away to expose fresh steel and the tool must then have the bevel reestablished and the edge re-honed. High speed steel is not prone to blueing (overheating) whereas carbon steel blues easily, requiring frequent quenching in water or oil to avoid losing temper.When woodturning, it is important to wear certain personal protective equipment (PPE). When working with spinning objects, loose clothing should not be worn, all jewellery should be removed, and long hair should be tied back. Since loose rags may also transfer color to the piece, paper towels should be used to avoid snags and accidents. Wood shavings generated during turning will need to be periodically removed.A good way to check the safety before starting the lathe is 'SAFER':Safe usage of a lathe also depends on the operator's choice of proper techniques for the lathe, tools, and wood. For example, using a high spindle speed with an unbalanced wooden blank may cause the lathe to vibrate dangerously. Spinning a large turning blank too quickly may cause it to explode. Inappropriate use of tools such as gouges and skew chisels can cause a catch, where the tool bites suddenly and aggressively into the wood in an uncontrolled manner. These risky practices can exert extremely large forces upon the wood, the tool, the lathe, and the operator.  The wood could fracture or tear free from the lathe. In lathe accidents, tools are often torn from the operator's hand and thrown in unexpected directions.  Particular care is required for wooden shapes that are not circular, such as off-center work, and for bowls with wings or square rims. Portions of the turning extend farther from the axis of rotation and are sometimes more difficult to see than the bulk of the wooden blank."

USS Aniwa;"USS Aniwa (ID-3146) was a steel-hulled, single-screw freighter that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.Aniwa was a Design 1015 ship built under a United States Shipping Board contract and completed as SS Aniwa in 1918 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Shipbuilding Company. She was earmarked for U.S. Navy World War I service with the naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 3146. She departed her builder's yard for final sea trials on the morning of 25 July 1918 and arrived at San Francisco, California, that afternoon. On the morning of 26 July 1918, Aniwa was commissioned as USS Aniwa'.Aniwa moved to the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, on 27 July 1918 to take on stores and embark the balance of her crew. She moved on to Port Costa, California, on 31 July 1918 and loaded a cargo of flour. Underway for the United States East Coast on 7 August 1918, Aniwa transited the Panama Canal on 23 August 1918 and, after clearing Cristóbal, Panama Canal Zone, early on 24 August 1918, shaped course for New York City. She reached Brooklyn, New York, on the afternoon of 4 September 1918.Earlier in 1918, United States Ambassador to Russia David R. Francis had urged the sending of shiploads of foodstuffs to Archangel in North Russia for a three-fold purpose: (1) to feed the local Russian population whose flow of provisions had been interrupted by the Czech Legion's occupation of the Trans-Siberian Railway, (2) to provide for the Allied representatives in the city of Vologda, Russia, should they retire northward, and (3) to create a favorable image of the United States in Russia. Accordingly, shortly after midday on 15 September 1918, Aniwa headed out to sea with her cargo of flour in a convoy bound ultimately for Archangel.Aniwa arrived off the mouth of the Dvina River on 11 October 1918 and ascended the river on 12 October 1918. At 17:45 hours that day she made fast alongside the British merchant ship SS Grofe Castle, which in turn was moored to a wharf at Archangel. Aniwa immediately posted watches bow and stern to protect Aniwa and her cargo. On 14 October 1918, four soldiers—a corporal and three privates—reported to Aniwa to serve as an armed guard.An outbreak of influenza in Archangel curtailed shore leave for Aniwa's crew during certain periods of the ship's stay there. It even struck Aniwa's hospital corpsman, who had to be sent ashore for treatment in the American Red Cross hospital. To fill the gap created by his illness, the ships' doctors of U.S. Navy cargo ship USS West Gambo (ID-3220) and U.S. Navy cruiser USS Olympia (Cruiser No. 6) visited Aniwa and ministered to her sick.Unloading operations proceeded nearly without incident. However, on the afternoon of 23 October 1918, two Russian stevedores, obviously feeling the shortage of foodstuffs ashore, were caught trying to leave the ship with small quantities of Aniwa's cargo of flour. Then, on 5 November 1918, a sling broke, dropping a bale of hemp on a Russian stevedore. Fortunately, he was not badly hurt and was soon on his way to a Russian hospital for treatment.Aniwa got underway for the United States in ballast on the morning of 10 November 1918 with a small number of passengers embarked. World War I ended the following day.Aniwa reached Brooklyn on 8 December 1918. Shifting to Bush Terminal at Brooklyn soon thereafter, she loaded 6,905 tons of general cargo and underwent a few minor repairs.Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Aniwa cleared the port of New York shortly after midday on 29 December 1918 bound for Gibraltar. As the days wore on, the weather remained fairly rough, with the ship rolling easily in the long swells, and she took water forward and aft, a leak in the after storeroom occupied the attention of at least one man for nearly an entire day on 7 January 1919. Soon thereafter, problems with her condenser and boilers forced her to put into the Azores on 10 January 1919 for voyage repairs.Underway again on 28 January 1919, Aniwa reached Gibraltar on 4 February 1919 and remained there for a short while before resuming her voyage to Genoa, Italy, where she arrived on the morning of 11 February 1919.Inept cargo handling during unloading operations at Genoa caused much damage to the shipment of foodstuffs that Aniwa had carried from New York. Finally, in early March, after having discharged all that she had brought, she took on ammunition from the U.S. Navy tugs USS Nahant (SP-1250) and USS Penobscot (SP-982) for transportation back to the United States, and then loaded ballast for the return trip. She departed Genoa on the morning of 17 March 1919.After touching briefly at Gibraltar on 23 March 1919 and 24 March 1919 to pick up passengers, Aniwa arrived off Tompkinsville at Staten Island, New York on 15 April 1919. There, she unloaded the ammunition. She soon moved to the pier at East 19th Street in New York City. She was decommissioned there on 21 April 1919, and her name was struck from the Navy List the same day.Turned over to the United States Shipping Board for operation, the ship, once again as SS Aniwa, continued carrying cargo, now under civilian auspices. During the remainder of 1919 she called at Mobile, Alabama, Liverpool, England, and Newport News, Virginia.Aniwa was laid up in 1923 and remained inactive until being discarded due to age and deterioration during the fiscal year 1930."
Armoire de fer;"L'armoire de fer (French: 'iron chest') in general refers to an iron chest used to house important papers. A notable and frequent use of the term refers to a hiding place at the apartments of Louis XVI of France at the Tuileries Palace where some secret documents were kept. The existence of this iron cabinet, hidden behind wooden panelling, was publicly revealed in November 1792 to Roland, Girondin Minister of the Interior.A locksmith by the name of François Gamain helped reveal these documents to the authorities, who rewarded him with a government pension. The cabinet hid correspondence between Louis XVI and, among others, Mirabeau, whose venality and duplicity were exposed. Also, the cabinet included the correspondence of the king with the financier Maximilien Radix de Sainte-Foix, an important secret advisor of the sovereign, with the bankers Joseph Duruey, and Tourteau de Septeuil, with Arnaud Laporte, a Royalist government minister who controlled large funds of money during the revolution, with François de Bonal, Bishop of Clermont, et al.Most of the pieces of correspondence in the cabinet involved ministers of Louis XVI (Montmorin, Valdec Lessart, Bertrand de Molleville, Count of Narbonne, Cahier de Gerville, Charles François Dumouriez, et al.).Other letters involved prominent figures of the Revolution, such as General Santerre, Lafayette, Antoine Rivarol, and Talleyrand. There were rumors that only selected documents were made public, and that certain other documents were destroyed. The Interior Minister Roland would have played a role in this regard, and may have destroyed documents involving his colleague Danton.After the discovery of the armoire de fer, Mirabeau's remains were removed from the Pantheon. On 20 November 1792, Jean-Marie Roland filed these archives—at least what was left of them (which was considerable)—with the office of the National Convention, negating all maneuvers to prevent putting Louis XVI on trial.[1] By the order of the Convention of 6 December 1792, many of these documents were published by the national printing office in 1792–1793."
2019 Cotabato earthquakes;"The 2019 Cotabato earthquakes were an earthquake swarm which struck the province of Cotabato on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines in October 2019.[6] Three of these earthquakes were above 6.0 on the moment magnitude scale with a Mercalli intensity of VIII. More than 40 people have been reported dead or missing and nearly 800 were injured as a result of these events.Mindanao lies across the complex convergent boundary between the Sunda Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate.[7] Part of the oblique convergence between these plates is taken up by subduction along the Cotabato Trench. The strike-slip component of the convergence is accommodated partly by the Philippine Fault System and partly by the Cotabato Fault System, a network of mainly NW-SE trending sinistral (left-lateral) strike-slip faults that form the boundary between the Cotabato Arc and the Central Mindanao Volcanic Belt.[8] In the area of the October 2019 earthquakes series, the individual faults include the NW-SE trending South Columbio Fault, North Columbio Fault, M'Lang Fault, Makilala–Malungon Fault and Tangbulan Fault, and the SW-NE trending Makilala Fault and Balabag Fault.[9]The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) reported that an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude was recorded at 19:37 PST (UTC+8) with a depth of 10.0 km kilometers (recorded as 6.4 Mw  at a depth of 12.8 km by the USGS). The epicenter was 7 kilometers ENE of Columbio,[10] 22 kilometers southeast of Tulunan, Cotabato where the earthquake was felt at Intensity VII.[1] VII was also reached at M'lang and Kidapawan. Intensity VI was reached at Tacurong, Santo Niño in South Cotabato, and Digos in Davao del Sur. The earthquake was a result of sinistral movement on a NW-SE trending strike-slip fault.[24]and Tupi, South Cotabato, General Santos City, Alabel and Malungon, Sarangani, Davao City,Kalamansig, Lebak & Palimbang, Sultan KudaratKadingilan and Damulog, Bukidnon, Mawab, Compostela Valley, Cotabato City, Matanog, Bariraand Sultan Kudarat, MaguindanaoGingoog City, Misamis Oriental,Philippine government seismologist Renato Solidum described the quake as "moderately powerful". The National Tsunami Center issues a statement saying no present tsunami threat from the earthquake.[26][27][28]Three malls in Davao City reported damage following the earthquake.[29] In General Santos, the Gaisano Mall was mostly gutted following a fire triggered by the earthquake.[30] 143 buildings were damaged and one was destroyed. The damaged buildings included 40 houses, 70 schools, 7 health facilities, 10 commercial buildings, and 2 places of worship.[31]On October 29, 2019, a 6.6-magnitude earthquake struck the island of Mindanao in the Philippines at a depth of 14.0 km, according to the USGS, and 7 km according to PHIVOLCS. The maximum perceived shaking was VII on both the PEIS and MMS scales. This intensity was reached in Tulunan, Makilala, Kidapawan City, Digos City, and Malungon. This earthquake was caused by movement on a different, but related, strike-slip fault to the October 16 event.[32][33]Magnitude 6.6[34]Magsaysay, Davao del Sur and Malungon, SaranganiGeneral Santos City, Magpet, Cotabato, Tacurong City, Kalamansig, Bagumbayan, SultanKudarat, Alabel, Sarangani, Kalilangan and Damulog, Bukidnon, Tagum City, Davao del NorteGlan, Maitum, Maasim and Kiamba, Sarangani, Butuan City, Iligan City, Tubod and Bacolod,Lanao del NorteZamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga City, Gingoog City, Misamis Oriental and Bislig CityA major fire broke out in General Santos City. There were power outages in many parts of Cotabato and locally in South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and Sarangani.[35] At least ten deaths were reported, with a minimum of another four hundred injured.[36] The fatalities were reported in Arakan, Carmen, Tulunan, Makilala, Digos City, and Magsaysay. School classes were suspended in parts of North Cotabato, South Cotabato, and Sultan Kudarat.[37]On October 31, 2019, a 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck the island of Mindanao in the Philippines at a depth of 10 km according to the USGS, with the epicenter located 1 km south of Kisante. A maximum perceived shaking of VII (PEIS) was reported from Tulunan, Makilala, Kidapawan City, Santa Cruz, Matanao, Magsaysay, Bansalan and Digos City. Some buildings in Davao and Soccksargen were seriously damaged and some collapsed. The death toll of these two quakes (October 29 and 31) was raised to 24, with 563 people injured, and 11 still missing.[38] More than 300 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake.Magnitude 6.5[39]and Santa Cruz, Davao Del Sur, Digos CityKudarat, Malungon, Sarangani, Koronadal City, General Santos CitySultan Kudarat, Kalilangan, Damulog, Kadingilan and Talakag, Bukidnon, Alabel, Malampatanand Kiamba, Sarangani, Tacurong CityDon Carlos, Maramag, Quezon, Libona, Valencia City and Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, Tubod andKauswagan, Lanao Del Norte, Naawan, Misamis Oriental, El Salvador City, Gingoog City, Cagayan De Oro City, Butuan City, Bislig CityDapitan City, Dipolog CityA hotel in Kidapawan City collapsed following the earthquake, fortunately, according National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), no one was inside in the building when the earthquake struck.[40] The Davao City government suspended the classes on all levels.[41] Affected residents in Makilala, Cotabato have begged on the highway for basic needs such as rice and tents.[42][43] According to the NDRRMC, about 30,000 families or 150,000 individuals affected by the earthquake.[42]The Cotabato sequence was followed by an earthquake, with a magnitude of Mw  6.8 (ANSS) or Ms  6.9 (PHIVOLCS), on December 15 at 14:11 PST with an epicenter in the neighboring province of Davao del Sur. It had a hypocentral depth of between 22.4 km (ANSS) and 3.0 km (PHIVOLCS) and a maximum felt intensity of VII MMI or VII PEIS.[44] The greatest damage was reported from the towns of Matanao, Magsaysay, Hagonoy and Padada. The earthquake caused 13 deaths and a further 210 people were injured.[45]The earthquake sequence triggered a large number of landslides and rockslides. Municipalities affected by landslides include Kidapawan City, Antipas, Arakan, Makilala, M'Lang and Tulunan in Cotabato province, Magsaysay, Bansalan, Malalag, Matanao and Kiblawan in Davao Del Sur.[9] Three fatalities were caused by landslides triggered by the October 29 shock with a further six people reported missing. Two fatalities were caused by landslides triggered by the October 31 shock, with a further five people reported missing.[38]The US Ambassador to the Philippines, Sung Kim, and the EU delegation to the Philippines both offered their condolences to the Filipino people. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also sent his message of sympathy to Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. The Chinese government has donated ¥3 million yuan (roughly equivalent to ₱22 million pesos) to support the disaster relief efforts in Mindanao.[46] Meanwhile, the Spanish Consulate in the Philippines pledged to donate up to 35,000 euros to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and 70,000 euros to assist people in water, hygiene and sanitation.[47]The Provincial Government of South Cotabato, Sarangani and the City of General Santos was one of the first to initiate to help the citizens with blankets, trapal, food and water near the epicenter of the earthquake swarm, most especially in the Municipalities of Makilala, Tulunan, M'lang and City of Kidapawan.[48] Local citizens in Soccsksargen acted in both giving donations in the government processes and privately giving donations across the highway in Makilala, Tulunan and Kidapawan. The Davao City Government also helped the affected areas. The Island Garden City of Samal Government also went to Cotabato Province to give relief goods and drinking water. The Bangsamoro Government also went to the affected areas to give relief goods. The municipal government of Datu Saudi Ampatuan  also went to the area to share donations to help the affected people. Among other institutions that immediately helped where banks, malls, universities and schools in Soccsksargen and Davao Region to assist their fellow Mindanaoans in crisis.[48]"

Zombie walk;"OverviewZombies in mediaA zombie walk is an organized public gathering of people who dress up in zombie costumes. Participants usually meet in an urban center and make their way around the city streets and public spaces (or a series of taverns in the case of a zombie pub crawl) in an orderly fashion. Zombie walks can be organized simply for entertainment or with a purpose, such as setting a world record or promoting a charitable cause. Originating in North America during the 2000s, zombie walks have occurred throughout the world.Zombie walks are relatively common in large cities, especially in North America. Some have been established as annual traditions, though others are organized as spontaneous flash mob events or performance art. The complexity and purpose of zombie walks varies. As an advanced technique to heighten interest and realism, some zombie mobs will "eat" victims to create new zombies, in sight of onlookers.[1] Some participants occasionally dress up as soldiers who are called in to contain the outbreak, or survivors who are trying to defend themselves from the onslaught of the zombie horde. Some events are staged as spoof political rallies organized "to raise awareness of zombie rights", with participants carrying placards.[2] Some zombie walks have also been staged as "hunger marches" with the intent of raising awareness of world hunger and collecting items for food banks.[3] The earliest zombie walk styled event on record was put together rather last-minute at the Gen Con gaming convention in Milwaukee in August 2000. The event was created to poke good-natured fun at the Vampire: The Masquerade LARPers that were taking over large portions of the convention, and disrupt their games. Michael Yates, Mark Stafford, Jacob Skowronek and several others organized the event with roughly 60 participants. The event was later recorded in the book 40 Years of Gencon[4] with photos and recollections from the organizers. While it was rumored that the organizers were arrested and thrown out of the convention for their flash mob of zombies, they were simply questioned by security before being told to disband.Another early zombie walk was held in Sacramento, California on August 19, 2001.[5][6][7][8]The event, billed as "The Zombie Parade", was the idea of Bryna Lovig, who suggested it to the organizers of Trash Film Orgy[9] as a way to promote their annual midnight film festival.[10] It was held again on July 27, 2002, and has since become an annual event,[10][11] drawing over 1,000 participants in 2012.[12]The event was traditionally held as the kick off to the six-week film festival at Sacramento's historic Crest Theatre[13] until 2014 when the theatre's general manager of 28 years, Laura "Sid" Garcia-Heberger, couldn't reach a lease renewal agreement with the building owners.[14]Despite the film festival's change of venue, TFO continues the walk as part of a free all-ages event, the "Carnival of the Dead", which includes food trucks from local vendors, make up stations, live bands, contests, games, and a projected movie in the park at the end of the night.[15][16][17] The streets in downtown Sacramento comprising the walk's route are shut down by the city in order to safely accommodate the large numbers of participants.[18]The first gathering specifically billed as a "Zombie Walk" occurred in October 2003 in Toronto,[19] organized by local horror movie fan Thea Munster and with only seven participants.[20] A "zombie demonstration" occurred in Sherbrooke, Quebec, on November 1, 2003, organized by a local grassroots organization, with 60 participants walking on a one kilometer course downtown.[21] Another zombie march was organized the next year by the same group in Sherbrooke, with nearly 200 participants. In subsequent years, the Toronto Zombie Walk has grown tremendously in size, with the 2014 event playing host to more than 15,000 participants.[22] The Zombie Walk has spread to Vancouver, creating the zombie walk tradition in that city.[23] On August 27, 2005, over 400 participants proceeded through Vancouver's Pacific Centre mall, travelled on the SkyTrain (referred to for the event as the "SkyBrain" or the "BrainTrain"), and continued 35 blocks to Mountain View Cemetery.The mid to late 2000s saw an exponential gain in popularity for zombie walks, due largely to the success of zombie films at the time, such as the Resident Evil movies, 28 Days Later, Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, George A. Romero's Land of the Dead, and Zombieland. Documentation of zombie walks consequently began to appear more often in mainstream news media[24] and blogs. Zombie walks soon spread across North America and to cities around the globe, such as Mar del Plata, Argentina.[25] Rio de Janeiro had its first zombie walk on November 2, 2007 (Day of the Dead) and the event has become annual since then.[26]On October 29, 2006, nearly 900 "zombie walkers" gathered at the Monroeville Mall outside of Pittsburgh, which served as the set of George A. Romero's classic zombie film Dawn of the Dead, to participate in Pittsburgh's first annual Walk of the Dead.[27] In addition to setting a Guinness World Record, the event was a benefit for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Pittsburgh's zombie walk has since grown into an annual horror festival called Zombie Fest and organized by The It's Alive Show, a local Pittsburgh late night horror and science fiction television program.[28] The Pittsburgh festival plays host to the annual Walk of the Dead as well as a zombie ball, costume contest, concerts, and celebrity guest appearances, and also serves as the headquarters of The It's Alive Show's World Zombie Day, a world hunger charity event.[29]Zombie walks are also a regular occurrence at ZomBcon, "the world's first zombie convention" which takes place every October in Seattle. Apart from zombie walks, ZomBcon also features panel discussions with zombie authors, actors and artists, workshops, film screenings, and other activities for zombie fans.[30] ZomBcon also organizes Seattle's annual Red, White and Dead zombie walk every July.[31]The first zombie walk world record was set on October 29, 2006 at Monroeville Mall outside of Pittsburgh, during the city's first annual Walk of the Dead. Guinness World Records certified that 894 people participated in the walk.[27] The second zombie walk at Monroeville Mall during the 2007 Zombie Fest was also verified by Guinness World Records as the largest gathering of zombies to date, with 1,028 participants.[32]The 2007 Toronto Zombie Walk drew a crowd of over 1,100 zombies, a number confirmed by Toronto Police Services.[33] At the time, this was the largest zombie walk on record.[34] A zombie march in Brisbane on May 25, 2008 set an unofficial record of over 1,500 participants, according to media reports.[35] On June 21, 2008, a zombie march took place in Chicago with over 1,550 zombies estimated, setting a new unofficial record.[36]On October 31, 2008, a zombie walk took place in the Old Market Square of Nottingham, England, with 1,227 attendees. The event was organized by GameCity, and the zombies did dances to zombie-related songs such as "Thriller", "Disturbia", and "Ghostbusters", and featured a performance from American singer Jonathan Coulton. The event achieved a new official Guinness World Record for largest zombie walk.[37] In June 2009, Pittsburgh zombie fans won back the Guinness World Record after Guinness verified that the Zombie Fest 'Walk of the Dead' at Monroeville Mall on October 26, 2008, had 1,341 participating walkers.[38]On July 3, 2009, a zombie walk organized by Fremont Outdoor Movies in Seattle beat all previous zombie walk records. Guinness World Records officially recorded 3,894 zombies at the Red, White and Dead zombie event,[39] though local news claimed 4277 participants.[40][41] In October 2009, Guinness World Records officially recorded and approved a new record for the largest gathering of zombies. The record was set at the Big Chill Festival in Ledbury, England, on August 6, 2009. There were 4,026 zombie mob participants.[42]On October 25, 2009, the biggest recorded gathering of zombies in the Southern Hemisphere occurred in Brisbane, with over 5,000 participants reportedly in attendance as reported by the Queensland Police. The walk was also a charity event helping to raise awareness and money for the Brain Foundation of Australia.[43] On October 30, 2009, zombie walkers in Grand Rapids, Michigan attempted a second run at the zombie mob world record. An estimated 8,000 participants braved rainy weather to gather in Calder Plaza outside of Grand Rapids City and County buildings. The event was coordinated by Rob Bliss, organizer of Grand Rapids's first zombie walk. Volunteers collected signatures from the crowd, though the record is currently unverified by Guinness.[44] Organizers of the fifth annual Denver Zombie Crawl in Denver counted more than 7,300 zombie walkers in the event. This is considered to be a low figure, as up to one third of the total participants did not walk through the counter. The crawl took place on October 23, 2010, in downtown Denver at the 16th Street Mall.[45][46] On October 24, 2010, a reported 10,000-strong zombie walk took place in Brisbane. As with previous years, the event raised money for the Brain Foundation of Australia.[47]Guinness officially recognized a new record for the world's largest gathering of zombies on October 30, 2010, at the third annual New Jersey Zombie Walk on the Asbury Park Boardwalk in Asbury Park. Guinness recorded 4,093 zombies at the event, though organizers, police, and fire officials estimate more than 5,000 zombies were in attendance.[48]In July 2011, more cities would attempt to break this world record. On July 2, 2011, Seattle attempted to take back the record at the 3rd annual Fremont Red, White and Dead Zombie Walk hosted by Fremont Outdoor Movies.[49] The zombie count according to Fremont organizers was 4,522[50] in attendance with estimations of over 4,800–5,000 after the official stop point for counting zombies. Representatives from Guinness did not attend the event. On July 23, 2011, the Dublin Zombie Walk[51] in Dublin had an estimated 8,000 zombies in attendance, but confirmation is still pending from Guinness World Records.October 2011 also saw multiple attempts to break the New Jersey world record. Over 7,000 zombies are believed to have attended the 9th Annual Toronto Zombie Walk on October 22.[52] Both the annual Denver Zombie Crawl on October 22[53] and the annual Brisbane Zombie Walk on October 23[54] claim to have had over 12,000 zombie participants. On October 29, the city of Long Beach, California, set out to break the world record as part of its fourth annual zombie walk, produced by community organizations Long Beach Cinematheque and Mondo Celluloid, and partnered with Michael Jackson-inspired flash mob "Thrill the World", who set out to break a world record of their own with the world's biggest "Thriller" flash mob. By night's end, an estimated 14,000 participants had taken over the entirety of the downtown area, breaking local business sales records and all but shutting down traffic for hours.[citation needed] In November 2011, Mexico City counted 9,806 for their large zombie gathering.[55]The zombie walk of October 20, 2012 in Santiago, Chile had more than 12,000 zombies walking in the city, though no Guinness record was broken.[56] On October 28, 2012, Buenos Aires gathered 25,000 zombies.[57]The zombie walk occurring November 2012, in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis–Saint Paul) holds the current world record for zombie gathering, recognized by Guinness at a count of 8,027 at Midway Stadium in Saint Paul on October 13, 2012. Estimates of the entire Twin Cities crawl put the zombie event upwards of 30,000 zombie participates, surpassing any other gathering of its kind, official or not.[58]In 2013, the Asbury Park event reclaimed the world record with 9,592 zombies.[59] In October 19, 2013 an estimated 15,000 Chileans took to the streets of Santiago to take part in the city's fourth annual Zombie Walk. The zombies limped two kilometres along the Alameda, one of the main thoroughfares in the Chilean capital.[60]Charity work continues to be a common component of zombie walks across the planet.[61][62][63] Community service organizations such as Zombie Squad have used zombie walks as demonstrations to raise funds and awareness for local and global issues, such as world hunger.[3][64]Both world record walks at Pittsburgh's Zombie Fest have included food drives. In 2008, The It's Alive Show initiated World Zombie Day.[65] The It's Alive Show encouraged cities all over the globe to celebrate World Zombie Day by holding zombie walks to raise awareness of global hunger. The first World Zombie Day took place October 26, 2008, the same day as Pittsburgh's Zombie Fest, when more than 30 cities worldwide took part. Food drives for local hunger-related charities took place at each participating city's zombie walk. Pittsburgh's walk alone brought in more than one ton of food to benefit the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.[66] The second World Zombie Day took place October 11, 2009, with even more participation from cities all over the world.[65]October 21, 2012 saw over 12,000 participants march through the city of Brisbane. With a new music festival format added to the event, Brisbane Zombie Walk raised $55,000 for the Brain Foundation of Australia, making them the most successful zombie charity event in the world. In 2011, the Brisbane Zombie Walk made over $25,000 for the Brain Foundation.[67]Some zombie walks incorporate pub crawling, during which participants visit multiple bars over the course of the walk. The first large-scale zombie pub crawl was held in Minneapolis on October 15, 2005. The crawl consisted of roughly 150 participants in zombie costumes moving from bar to bar in the city's Northeast district. The Minneapolis "Zombie Pub Crawl" has since become an annual event and attendance has grown exponentially. It has been held in Downtown Minneapolis since 2015.[68]Similar large-scale zombie-themed pub crawls have developed in New Orleans,[69] Providence, Rhode Island, Reno, Houston, Eau Claire, Chicago,[70] Winona,[71] and Philadelphia.[72] Philadelphia's zombie pub crawl is held on Easter Sunday in celebration of Jesus, "the world's most famous zombie". Zombie pub crawls are now a regular occurrence in cities all over the world. The New York City Zombie Crawl has involved attendees walk all over Manhattan and drink at different pubs.[73] In 2007, the Viking Hats group organized a Halloween zombie walk in London that ended at the Tate London.[74] London's Zombie Pub Crawl has become an annual Halloween weekend event.[75] Winona Zombie Crawl started out in 2006 as a publicly unadvertised event where zombies showed up at bars, unexpectedly, to simulate an actual zombie apocalypse.[76]In 2007, zombies used bicycles to travel around town in the initial Ride of the Living Dead event in Kenosha, Wisconsin. An offshoot of the non-zombie summer Handlebars and Bars bicycle pub crawl, this event began with about 40 riders in its debut, and has since grown exponentially. In 2014, the event attracted over 400 zombie bicyclists and featured indie-rock bands from the Milwaukee-Chicago corridor as entertainment throughout the day.[77]In 2006, a young woman in Bloomington, Indiana reported to police that a group of "zombies" attacked her car by covering the vehicle in "purple goo", the zombies in question turned out to be participants in a small, local zombie walk, and several arrests were made.[78] At the 2006 Vancouver Zombie Walk, an incident occurred in which two impatient drivers attempted to drive their cars through a crowd of zombies headed down Robson Street: this resulted in some severe injuries among the zombies, but no damage to the vehicles. Another incident involved a pair of zombies using a brick to shatter the window of a man's car, both zombies were arrested.[79]In 2010, the annual Zombie Shuffle in Melbourne saw the largest attendance in its five-year history, but some locals complained of the mess that the zombie "gore" left behind, as well as the walk's disruption of a play for preschoolers.[80] In 2011 and 2012, participants in the Minneapolis Zombie Pub Crawl broke store windows and caused other damage to the area in which the event was held. Many residents see the event as disruptive to the life of the neighborhood.[81] In 2012, a Russian zombie walk in support of Pussy Riot in Omsk, Siberia was banned by the local government.[82]In October 2015, a shooting occurred at the ZombiCon in Fort Myers, Florida.[83] 1 person was killed and 5 others were wounded. Lawsuits led to cancellation of the event the next year. [84]"

Rio Perequê Municipal Nature Park;"The Rio Perequê Mangroves Municipal Nature Park (Portuguese: Parque Natural Municipal do Manguezal do Rio Perequê) is a municipal nature park in the state of Paraná, Brazil. It protects an area of mangroves along the Perequê River in the town of Pontal do Sul.The Rio Perequê Municipal Nature Park is in the municipality of Pontal do Paraná, Paraná.It has an area of 16.2 hectares (40 acres) along the Perequê River.[1]The name is from Tupi-Guarani words that mean "fish entry", referring to the estuary where fish gather to spawn.The park is administered by the Pontal do Paraná Municipal Department of Environment, Tourism, Agriculture and Fisheries, which partners with the Federal University of Paraná's Center for Marine Studies.[2]It is part of the Lagamar Mosaic.[3]The headquarters are on the Avenida Beira-Mar in Pontal do Sul, and are open from 8am to 8pm daily.[2]The park protects an area of mangroves, which provides a habitat for birds, crabs and oysters.[1]The Perequê River has a meandering course of about 2.6 kilometres (1.6 mi) and is dominated by the tides.The mangroves cover about 30 hectares (74 acres).[4]The environment has been degraded by disposal of garbage, oil spills from small vessels, abandoned buildings and deforestation.[5]The park supports environmental education.The "micuim" (crab trail) is suspended over the mangrove so that visitors can examine the ecosystem and its characteristics.[1]The Perequê River was used as a port for landing goods that came by sea from Paranaguá and were delivered to Matinhos and Guaratuba by ox cart.The river bed was affected by urban development in the 1950s that followed creation of the Pontal do Sul beach, and the mouth of the river was diverted in 1953. In the late 1970s the course was changed to make way for a road, and in the early 1980s the course was again changed to make way for aquaculture tanks for the UFPR Center for Marine Biology.[2]A team from what was now the UFPR Center for Marine Studies proposed protection of the area in 1996, and in 1999 the area was made into a municipal Biological Reserve.[2]The Restinga Municipal Nature Park and the Rio Perequê Municipal Nature Park were created by municipal decree 706/01 of 10 September 2001 to protect the restinga and mangrove areas of Pontal do Paraná.[6]The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) provided about R$195,000 for creation of the Rio Perequê Park.[2]The park boundaries were modified in 2002 due to conflicts over land ownership, removing some of the downstream portion and adding a section further upstream.[7]About 16 hectares (40 acres) was removed from the north, probably due to real estate speculation, and about 8 hectares (20 acres) was added to the south.[8]The park was inaugurated in December 2003, with a headquarters that provides a space for cultural activities and environmental education.In January 2004 it was showing a photographic exhibition on the environment of Paraná.[2]The management committee was created in 2005, and a new survey was made that established the area of the park as covering the entire area of water and mangroves, even where directly adjoining buildings and streets.The municipality was asked to enact a new law for assignment of use of the area beside the park.[9]In March 2014 it was announced that as part of the Marine Biodiversity Recovery Program a saltwater aquarium would be installed in the park.[10]"

USRC Onondaga (1898);"USRC Onondaga was an Algonquin-class cutter built for the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service for service on the Great Lakes. Because of the Spanish–American War, she was cut in half shortly before completion and transported to Ogdensburg, New York for service on the Atlantic coast although the war ended before she could be put into service. After the formation of the United States Coast Guard in 1915 she became USCGC Onondaga. She served as a patrol vessel at various Atlantic coast ports before World War I and unlike most Coast Guard cutters during World War I, she remained under the control of the Commandant of the Coast Guard. After the war she patrolled for a brief time based at New London, Connecticut before being decommissioned in 1923.The United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter Onondaga was laid down in 1897 at the Globe Iron Works's yard in Cleveland (yard number 72) and launched on 23 December 1897, with Miss Louis Augusta Allen being the sponsor.[6][7] She was a steel-hulled vessel equipped with a triple-expansion steam engine, Scotch boilers, and a single screw. She was one of the first RCS cutters built with electric generators to supply current for lights and call bells.[8][9] Before Onondaga could be completed, she was transferred to U.S. Navy control because of the outbreak of the Spanish–American War on 24 March 1898 and the contractor was directed to cut the ship in half for transport to Ogdensburg, New York. She was reassembled and was finally accepted for service by the government 13 August and returned to Department of the Treasury control on 17 August at the conclusion of hostilities. She was placed in commission 24 October at Ogdensburg and ordered to report for duty at Boston, Massachusetts.[1][2]After Onondaga arrived at Boston, she received winter cruising orders to patrol the area from the St. Croix River to Nantucket Shoals. During February 1899, she was tasked with breaking ice in the harbor at Sullivan, Maine.[1] On 8 December 1899, she received orders transferring her to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a patrol area set from Great Egg Harbor to Fort Monroe, Virginia, including Delaware Bay. While stationed at Philadelphia, she also had a temporary assignment escorting Marine Hospital Service ship Senator from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Havana, Cuba, in June 1900. In September 1900 she was temporarily assigned to Galveston, Texas. Onondaga was also used to cover other Revenue Cutter Servie cutters′ patrol areas when they were laid up for repairs.[1] On 1 July 1902, Onondaga conveyed Maine United States Senator William P. Frye and his party from New York City to Portland, Maine.[1] On 7 April 1904, she received orders to return to Galveston, Texas, and tow USRC Galveston to the Revenue Cutter Service Depot at Curtis Bay, Maryland, for major  repairs.[1][Note 1] On 10 December 1904, the tug Boxer collided with Onondaga at Philadelphia, striking her stern and necessitating that Onondaga undergo extensive repairs at Kensington Shipyard Company in Philadelphia.[11] Repairs were completed 7 February 1905, and she departed for Norfolk, Virginia, to patrol for the remainder of her winter cruise.[12] On 11 November 1905 she was notified that all winter patrols were to be based out of Norfolk while summer patrols were to be conducted out of Philadelphia.[12] After 13 April 1907, all patrols were based out of Norfolk, with occasional temporary duty at Tompkinsville on Staten Island, New York, while the cutters normally stationed there were in shipyards for repairs.[13] On 29 October 1907 she had a wireless telegraph installed at Norfolk.[14]On 7 June 1909, Onondaga was placed out of commission at the Revenue Cutter Service Depot for repairs. She sailed without commission to Norfolk for additional repairs and returned to the Revenue Cutter Service Depot 30 September 1909. Repairs were completed 6 November 1909, and she recommissioned and returned to normal patrol duties.[14] On 6 March 1910, USRC Mohawk assisted by Onondaga, towed the abandoned and waterlogged four-masted schooner Asbury Fountain to Norfolk after Asbury Fountain collided  with the steamer SS Jamestown.[15] On 23 May 1912, Onondaga was at Philadelphia, representing the Revenue Cutter Service at the convention of the Permanent International Association of Navigation Congresses.[14] On 9 May 1913, Onondaga received United States Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo and his party aboard for a cruise from Baltimore, Maryland, to Richmond, Virginia.[16]On 9 October 1913, the steel-hulled bark Manga Reva departed Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, bound for San Francisco, California, via Cape Horn with a cargo of coal, but about a week after she cleared Delaware Bay, her crew of 28 men mutinied while she was in the Atlantic Ocean 600 nautical miles (1,100 km) east of Bermuda. The mutineers forced her captain and other officers to sail her back toward Philadelphia. On 9 November 1913, she anchored inside the breakwater off Lewes, Delaware, in the midst of a gale. The weather prevented the pilot who came aboard from guiding her up the Delaware Bay to Philadelphia, and as he disembarked Manga Reva′s captain, despite warnings from the mutineers not to mention the mutiny, slipped him a note asking for help. The pilot notified the Philadelphia Navy Yard at League Island in Philadelphia of the mutiny, and the navy yard promptly radioed Onondaga. In response, Onondaga made for Lewes at full speed.  With a small crowd of onlookers from Lewes using telescopes to observe the action from the beach, Onondaga arrived on the scene on 10 November 1913 and fastened herself to Manga Reva with grappling hooks. Members of Onondaga′s crew leaped over the rail and onto the deck of Manga Reva and found the mutineers gathered on Manga Reva′s quarterdeck armed with sheath knives and other weapons they had found, shouting defiance at Onondaga′s crew. More Onondaga crewmen came aboard Manga Reva armed with rifles and fixed bayonets. The mutineers, intoxicated from drinking Manga Reva′s liquor supply overnight, retreated, and within five minutes, and with no shots fired, Onondaga′s crew brought the mutiny to an end and arrested the mutineers.[17][18][19]On 5 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I in Europe, Onondaga was authorized for duty in enforcing neutrality laws in the Chesapeake Bay area.[16] On 19 October 1914 she was placed out of commission at the Revenue Cutter Service Depot for overhaul, and her crew transferred to the Revenue Cutter Service Academy training ship USRC Itasca[20] When the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the United States Life-Saving Service to form the United States Coast Guard on 28 January 1915, Onondaga became a United States Coast Guard cutter, designated as USCGC Onondaga.[21] She was recommissioned on 29 January 1915 and her crew returned to her from Itasca.In the spring of 1915, the Italian steamer Verona arrived at the immigration station at Cape Henlopen, Delaware, carrying several hundred immigrants and, after immigration authorities discovered a suspected case of smallpox on board, the immigrants were confined to the quarantine station at Cape Henlopen.[22] Many of the immigrants were eager to reach New York City in time to celebrate Easter Sunday with relatives on 4 April 1915,[22] and about 200 of them pushed through the wire and past the guards at the quarantine station and arrived at the train station 3 miles (4.8 km) away in Lewes, demanding tickets to Philadelphia, but the station manager held them at bay with a pistol.[22] Onondaga arrived at Lewes and disembarked a detachment of 50 United States Marines carrying rifles with fixed bayonets, prompting the unarmed immigrants to return to the quarantine station.[22] The following day, a steamer arrived to take the immigrants to Philadelphia.[22]During the summer of 1915, Lieutenants Elmer F. Stone and Norman B. Hall of Onondaga proposed the use of airplanes to increase the search capabilities of the cutter in locating overdue fishing schooners. With the approval of Onondaga′s commanding officer, Captain Benjamin M. Chiswell, they flew scouting missions in an airplane loaned to them by a representative of the Curtiss Aeroplane Company.[23][24][25] On 16 October 1915, Onondaga was assigned a winter patrol area from Great Egg Harbor, New Jersey, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with a home port of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.[20] On 17 October 1916 her patrol area was changed to Cape Romain, South Carolina, to Cape Canaveral, Florida, with her home port at Savannah, Georgia. She patrolled this area until being recalled to the United States Coast Guard Depot on 31 March 1917. On 5 April 1917 she was decommissioned in preparation for transfer to the United States Navy for service in World War I.[20]After 6 April 1917, the Coast Guard was placed under the control of the Department of the Navy by executive order, however, Onondaga was unique among the cutters in the Coast Guard in that she was never assigned to a naval district commandant but instead received her orders directly from the Commandant of the Coast Guard. After re-commissioning on 18 May 1917, she sailed for New London, Connecticut where Captain Frederick C. Billard, also superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy, took command of her. Onondaga was used to convoy vessels turned over for use by the Coast Guard during the war from one port to another and to transfer personnel between units.[26] She also was used to train newly recruited enlistees and cadets at the Academy and for towing disabled vessels to shipyards for repair.[27][28]On 20 February 1918, Onondaga rescued the entire crew of the British steamship SS Veturia after she foundered on Diamond Shoals off the North Carolina coast. Captain Billard maneuvered Onondaga close by the grounded Veturia in heavy seas and dense fog and one of the small boats from Onondaga made seven trips rescuing the stranded crew of the grounded ship. Captain Billard and his crew received a commendation from the British Admiralty. The owners of the Veturia, Gow, Harrison and Company, sent a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, expressing appreciation for the rescue.[29] While on patrol near Montauk Point on 13 March 1918, she came to the aid of SS Kershaw, taking some of the crew off the stricken ship and placing them aboard USRC Tuscarora.[3]On 28 August 1919 the Coast Guard was returned to Department of the Treasury control. Onondaga continued patrol operations based out of New London until 1920, at which time she transferred to Baltimore. She continued to operate out of Baltimore until 1 January 1923, when she was placed out of commission at the Coast Guard Depot for repairs.[3] Funding for needed repairs was never received and her condition gradually deteriorated to the point where she had to be sold for scrap.[30] She was sold 16 September 1924 to Charles A. Jording of Baltimore for US$7,840.[3][Note 2]"

George R. Pettit;"George Robert Pettit II (June 8, 1929 – September 21, 2021) was a Regents’ Professor in Chemistry in the School of Molecular Sciences (SMS) at Arizona State University. He was an internationally renowned and respected researcher in the field of natural anticancer compounds throughout his career of over six decades. Pettit has been honored by the International Cancer Advocacy Network,[1] the American Society of Pharmacognosy,[2] and Washington State University, his alma mater. A special edition of the Journal of Natural Products[3] is dedicated to Pettit, and the French journal Médicine Sciences paid tribute to him.[4] Pettit’s achievements earned him the designation of Outstanding Investigator by the United States National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute (NCI).[5] Pettit and his impact on the field of anti-cancer compounds are the subject of the book, “Waging War on Cancer.”[6]George Robert “Bob” Pettit was born on June 8, 1929, the eldest son of George Robert and Florence Elizabeth (Seymour) Pettit in Long Branch, New Jersey.[6][7] Following his graduation from Long Branch High School, he attended Monmouth Junior College (since renamed as Monmouth University.[8] Pettit earned a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Washington State University in 1952 under the guidance of Professor Gardner Stacy.[6] Pettit then earned a Master of Science in Heterocyclic Chemistry in 1954, and his Ph.D. in Steroid Chemistry from Wayne State University under Carl Djerassi in 1956.[6][7]Pettit’s foray in natural products chemistry began in the summer of 1953, working for DuPont in Orange, Texas, just prior to beginning his graduate studies at Wayne State University. After graduating from Wayne State, Pettit was hired as a senior research chemist by Norwich Pharmaceutical Company, and moved to Norwich, New York. While there he worked on drug discovery related to the central nervous system yet remained passionate about anticancer research.[6]In 1957 Pettit left Norwich and began his teaching and anticancer research career at the University of Maine. Pettit received his first grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1959. Later, he applied for and received a construction grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to build a laboratory. Pettit continued his anticancer research at the University of Maine until 1965, having been promoted to full professor.In 1965, Pettit was hired as a Professor of Chemistry by Arizona State University, where he continued his anticancer research while training hundreds of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows throughout his career.In 1975, Pettit founded the Cancer Research Institute, serving as its director for 30 years. While at ASU, Pettit was appointed Dalton Professor of Cancer Research and Medicinal Chemistry, and later, Regents Professor of Chemistry.[4][6]Pettit’s overall strategy involved the harvesting of natural agents from marine organisms, microorganisms, insects, and plant specimens that were tested for anticancer components. Using this strategy, Pettit and his research group discovered multiple anti-cancer compounds, including bryostatins, dolastatins/auristatins, and combretastatins, several of which advanced into preclinical and clinical trials for a wide range of cancers, and others have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of a range of lymphomas.[2][6]In 2020 Pettit retired after 55 years of service to ASU.[4] During his tenure at ASU, Pettit published over 800 peer-reviewed research articles, 14 books, 17 book chapters, and received 70 U.S. patents. His papers have been cited over 30,000 times. Pettit’s h-index, a measure of his publications’ impact, is 89.[4][5]Pettit was a member of the American Society of Pharmacognosy, and also served as the senior editor of the Journal of Natural Products.[6]The late Professor Carl Djerassi described Pettit as “one of the great heroes in the chemistry of marine natural products out of which he created a battery of anti-cancer agents not equaled anywhere.”[6]Dr. Gordon Cragg, former chief of the National Cancer Institute’s Natural Products Branch, stated Pettit “can truly be regarded as one of the great pioneers and giants in natural products and drug discovery, and he was among the first to explore the realm of marine organisms as a source of potential antitumor agents. His early research in this area blossomed into a marine natural products drug discovery program of exceptional productivity and achievement.”[2]"
Odense;"Odense (/ˈoʊdənsə/ OH-dən-sə, US also /ˈoʊθənsə/ OATH-ən-sə,[7] Danish: [ˈoˀðn̩sə] (listen)) is the third largest city in Denmark (behind Copenhagen and Aarhus) and the largest city on the island of Funen. As of 1 January 2022, the city proper had a population of 180,863[8] while Odense Municipality had a population of 205,978,[9] making it the fourth largest municipality in Denmark (behind Copenhagen, Aarhus and Aalborg municipalities). Eurostat and OECD have used a definition for the Metropolitan area of Odense (referred to as a Functional urban area), which includes all municipalities in the Province (Danish: landsdel) of Funen (Danish: Fyn), with a total population of 504,066 as of 1 July 2022[10][11][4]By road, Odense is located 45 kilometres (28 mi) north of Svendborg, 144 kilometres (89 mi) to the south of Aarhus and 167 kilometres (104 mi) to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales.[12] He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there.There has been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years, although the name was not mentioned in writing until 988, and by 1070, it had already grown into a thriving city. Canute IV of Denmark, generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasants in Odense's St Alban's Priory on 10 July 1086. Although the city was burned in 1249 following a royal rivalry, it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the Middle Ages. After a period of decline, large-scale plans for development were made during the 18th century, which led to the rebuilding of Odense Palace and the building of a canal to the Port of Odense, facilitating trade. In 1865, one of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built, further increasing the population and commerce, and by 1900, Odense had reached a population of 35,000. Odense's Odinstårnet was one of the tallest towers in Europe when built in 1935 but was destroyed by the Nazis during World War II. The University of Southern Denmark was established in 1966.In the present day, Odense remains the commercial hub of Funen, and has a notable shopping district with a diversity of stores. Several major industries are located in the city including the Albani Brewery and GASA, Denmark's major dealer in vegetables, fruits and flowers. The city is home to Odense Palace, erected by King Frederik IV who died there in 1730, the Odense Theatre, the Odense Symphony Orchestra, and the Hans Christian Andersen Museum, situated in the house that was the birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen. In sports, Odense has a number of football clubs including OB, BM, B1909, and B1913, the Odense Bulldogs professional ice hockey team, and the city also hosts the H.C. Andersen Marathon. Odense is served by Hans Christian Andersen Airport and Odense station, which lies on the line between Copenhagen and the Jutland peninsula.The name Odense is derived from Odins Vé, meaning "Odin's sanctuary", as the area was known as a sanctuary for worshippers of the Nordic god, Odin.[13]Odense is one of Denmark's oldest cities. Archaeological excavations in the vicinity show proof of settlement for over 4,000 years since at least the Stone Age.[14][13] The earliest community was centred on the higher ground between the Odense River to the south and Naesbyhoved Lake (now dry) to the north. Nonnebakken, one of Denmark's former Viking ring fortresses, lay to the south of the river.[15] Today, Odense's Møntergården Museum has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in the Odense area.[16] The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river banks to defend it against invaders coming in from the coast.[14]The city celebrated its thousandth anniversary in 1988, commemorating the first mention of the town's name in a letter dated 18 March 988 from the German Emperor Otto III which granted rights to Odense and neighbouring settlements.[17] The first church in Odense appears to have been St Mary's,[18] probably built in the late 12th century.[19] The territory, previously part of the vast Archbishopric of Hamburg, was created a Catholic diocese in 988. The first recorded bishops of Odense were Odinkar Hvide and Reginbert, who was consecrated by Archbishop Æthelnoth of Canterbury, in 1022.[20]Recent excavations have shown that from the early 11th century, the town developed in the area around Albani Torv, Fisketorvet, Overgade and Vestergade.[15] By 1070, Odense had already grown into a city of stature in Denmark.[13] Canute IV of Denmark, generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasants, discontent with the high taxes he imposed on the town, in Odense's St Alban's Priory on 10 July 1086.[13] He was canonized in 1100.[21] The priory no longer exists, although a church has been situated on the site since about 900. At the beginning of the 12th century, Benedictine monks from England founded St Canute's Abbey. It was here the English monk Ælnoth wrote Denmark's first literary work, Vita et Passio S. Canuti (The Life and Passion of St Canute).[21] Canute's shrine in Odense Cathedral (which was attached to the priory) attracted pilgrims throughout the Middle Ages.[22]In the Middle Ages, a number of churches and monasteries were built in the town. St Canute's Church (Skt. Knuds Kirke), now the cathedral, dates from the end of the 13th century and was closely connected to the Benedictine Order. The town's other old churches are St Mary's (Vor Frue Kirke) and St John's (Skt. Hans Kirke) with its adjacent monastery. Greyfriars Monastery (Gråbrødre Kloster) was founded by the Franciscans in 1279.[17]In 1247 Odense was burned by Abel of Denmark during conflicts with his brother King Erik IV.[23] The cathedral had to be completely rebuilt.[24] Nevertheless, the town continued to flourish as a commercial centre, and was charted in 1335.[22] The city thrived economically during the Middle Ages, attracting many merchants and craftsman who traded their goods.[14]In 1482 Bishop Karl Rønnov brought the German printer Johann Snell to Odense to print a short prayer book, Breviarium Ottoniense, considered to be the first work to be printed in Scandinavia. In parallel Snell printed De obsidione et bello Rhodiano, an account of the Turkish siege of the island of Rhodes.[25][26]After the Danish Reformation, involving the suppression of the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where they spent the winter months. But the city's prosperity came to an abrupt end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed after the end of the Swedish Wars. A period of stagnation ensued until the end of the 18th century.[21]From the 16th century the town was the meeting-place of several parliaments, and until 1805 Odense was the seat of the provincial assembly of Funen. By 1700 Odense's population was about 4,000.[14]Dramatic changes began in Odense in the 18th century to modernise the city and a great plan was drawn up for development. In 1720, Frederick IV ordered the rebuilding of Odense Palace, partly on the foundations of the 13th century St. Hans’s Monastery, and the construction of St Hans’s Church by the Knights Hospitallers.[22][27] An 8 kilometre (5.0 mi) long, 7.5 metre (25 ft) deep canal from Odense Harbour to Odense Fjord was built between 1796 and 1806 to facilitate the growth of Odense as a port city, radically increasing its level of trade and population.[13][28] Founded in 1796, Odense Teater is the first provincial theatre in Denmark and the country's second oldest.[29][30] Odense Central Library was established in 1924 and removed to Odense station in 1995.[31] The Odense Music Library contains Denmark's largest collection of phonograms.[32]From the 1840s, the city enjoyed a period of rapid expansion beyond its traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed into one of the most important industries while the harbour facilities were further expanded.[33] In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense.[21] Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across Funen in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions.[13][14] All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and food and beverages. Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion,[29] and the population of the city began to grow markedly, by 1900 it had 35,000 inhabitants.[14]Odense's most famous landmark was Odinstårnet (The Odin Tower) constructed in 1935, as the second-tallest tower in Europe, only surpassed by the Eiffel Tower with its 177 meters.  Odinstårnet was blown up by a Danish Nazi group in 1944 and has never been rebuilt.[34] However, a miniature model now stands in Odinsparken in the area where the original was located. During the German occupation in the Second World War, Odense's general strike in August 1943 contributed to terminating collaboration with the Germans.[29]Until the beginning of the Danish industrial revolution, Odense was also the second-largest city in modern Denmark, but has in recent times been overtaken by Aarhus. From the 1960s Odense increasingly became a cultural hub, with the establishment of a university in 1966 and the launching of trade shows, including the large Odense Congress Centre.[13] In 1988 a major national television network, TV2, was established in Odense.[29]In celebration of the thousandth anniversary in 1988, a forest, Tusindårsskoven (meaning "The Thousand Year Forest") was planted.[13] In 2005 the city celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen.[13]The Odense Steel Shipyard (Staalskibsvæeft), which since 1996 had been Denmark's largest shipbuilding facility, closed in 2012 as a result of international competition. Opened in 1919 by A.P. Møller, it latterly produced container ships for Mærsk, the parent company. The Lindø site was sold to the Port of Odense (Odense Havn) who are developing the Lindø Industrial Park.[35]Odense is situated in the northeastern centre of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located 45 kilometres (28 mi) north of Svendborg, 144 kilometres (89 mi) to the south of Aarhus, 167 kilometres (104 mi) to the southwest of Copenhagen, 136 kilometres (85 mi) east of Esbjerg and 69 kilometres (43 mi) southeast of Kolding.[36]  Suburbs of Odense include Stige to the north, Seden, Bullerup and Agedrup to the northeast, Blommenslyst to the west, Bellinge to the southwest, and Neder Holluf and Højby to the south.[36]The Odense River flows through Odense, to the south of the main shopping quarter.[37] To the north of the city is the Odense Fjord, and to the northeast, along the 165 road to Kerteminde is Kerteminde Fjord. The fjord is accessed through the narrow passage of Gabets, between Hals and Skoven, and is connected by canal to the Port of Odense.[38] The small fishing village of Bregnor lies 2.3 miles (3.7 km) to the southeast of the passage. A controlling depth of 11 metres (36 ft) is reported in the northern part of channel between the entrance to the fjord and Lindo Terminal Quay.[38] The bight of Fyns Hoved to the northeast of the harbour curves south to form the approach to Odense Fjord. The eastern side of the bight between Fyns Hoved and Skoven, 5.5 metres (18 ft) to the south, is irregular, with a beach and hills behind it, and to the south of the bight is the small, shallow Korshavn Bay, with the Korshavn Light in the vicinity. Skoven is a bare, rugged peninsula, with Dalby Bay (Dalby Bugt) to the east.[38]In the southwestern part of the Odense Fjord are the islands of Vigelsø and the 21 hectare Tornø, although the latter is connected to the mainland by a 300-metre (980 ft)-long causeway. Vigelsø is the largest island in the fjord at 132 hectares and is an important breeding ground for migratory birds.[39] It is part of the Special Area of Conservation No. SPC 94, Odense Fjord under the EU Habitat and Birds Directives and has been subject to close monitoring, with the target to reach at least "good" ecological status by 2015.[40] The island is low-lying, the highest point of Østerhoved only reaching six metres above the sea. There is a 25 hectare forest on the northern part of the island while the southern part consists of coastal meadows.Odense has a temperate oceanic climate, classified as Köppen zone Cfb. Mild summers feature average maximum temperatures exceeding 20 °C (68 °F), while winters are characterised by minimum temperatures dropping just below freezing. The hottest months on average are July and August with highs of 21 °C (70 °F) and daily mean temperatures of 17 °C (63 °F) and 16 °C (61 °F) respectively.[41] These are also the wettest months, with August receiving 80 mm (3.1 in) and July 64 mm (2.5 in) of rain on average. Extratropical cyclones frequently affect the region, contributing to abundant precipitation.[41] The coldest months are January and February, with a daily mean temperature of 0 °C (32 °F), and lows of −2 °C (28 °F) and −3 °C (26 °F) respectively.[41]  It is common for Odense Fjord to contain ice between January and March, and the entrance is kept clear by icebreakers. The tidal range in the fjord varies up to 0.6 metres (2 ft 0 in), and winds from the west and northeast may raise the water level by up to 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) and winds from the east and southwest may lower it by up to 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in).[38] Climate data for the city are recorded at Hans Christian Andersen Airport (ICAO: EKOD).Odense has long been a populated town, and in 1670 it had a population of 3,808 people. By 1787 the population had grown to 5,363 to and 5,782 in 1801. The population grew markedly during the 19th century, reaching 8,709 inhabitants in 1834, 10,238 in 1845, 12,932 in 1855, 16,970 in 1870, 20,804 in 1880 and 30,268 in 1890.[45]With improvements in communications by rail and via the port, the population of Odense grew dramatically in the early 20th century. The 1901 census recorded 40,138 people, growing to 47,224 in 1911, 61,969 in 1921 and 87,090 in 1935. During the Second World War, the population passed the 100,000 mark, reaching 103,107 in 1945.[45] It continued to grow in the post war years, with 120,570 recorded in 1955 and 133,384 in 1965, the city reached a population of 139,490 people in 1970,[45] a time when it was developing as a university city after Odense University was established in 1966.Residents began to move out of the centre into the suburban areas which were included in Odense Municipality after boundaries were redefined in 1970.[29] As a result, the population declined slightly in the 1970s and 1980s, falling to 136,646 in 1981.[45] It began climbing again in the late 1980s, and steadily grew to 144,518 in 1996 and 145,554 in 2004.[45] In 2010 Odense had a population of 166,305 people.[46] As of 2017 it had a population of 176,683.[47]Odense Municipality is the administrative unit which covers not only the city of Odense but surrounding suburbs and villages. Odense City Council consists of 29 members, including a mayor. The former mayor of Odense, Anker Boye, is a member of the Social Democratic Party. His first term was from 1993 to 2005 when he was defeated by Jan Boye, a Conservative. He was re-elected in the 2009 election, forming a coalition with the Red–Green Alliance, the Socialist People's Party and the Social Democrats.[49][50] The city council's motto is At lege er at leve (Playing is living) summarising a new approach addressing learning, innovation, development and growth with targets for 2017.[51] Boye and his administration have been criticised for mismanaging the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen in 2005, above all for allegedly signing a contract with Tina Turner for a show which resulted in a deficit of 13 million kroner.[52]In the 2013 municipal elections, Boye was successful in obtaining sufficient support from the Liberals and the left to ensure his continuation as mayor from the beginning of 2014.[53]Boye announced in December 2016 that he would resign as mayor on 1 January 2017. The new mayor of Odense would be Peter Rahbæk Juel, also a member of the Social Democrats.[54] Rahbæk Juel succeeded Boye as announced and continues to serve as mayor after the municipal elections in November 2017.[55]Odense is Funen's most important industrial and commercial centre, and the city's central location in Denmark makes it one of the national convention and congress centres. Enterprises include the Albani Brewery, ABB (Asea Brown Boveri), Kansas Workwear (clothing), Plus Pack (canning and containers) as well as manufacturers in the electrical sector such as Riegens / SG Lighting. In recent years there has been a general trend from manufacturing into the service sector.[56] By 2002, 51% of the workforce was employed by the service sector while only 13% were working in industry.[33] Lindø Wharf, once Denmark's largest shipbuilding facility, has now been converted into Lindø Industrial Park specialising in the production and storage of components for the offshore industries, creating a variety of new tenants.[57] GASA, a large horticultural centre, supplies fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants to most of the country as well as for export.[30] Established in 1988, Denmark's major commercial television channel TV 2 is based in Odense.[58]The Rosengårdcentret shopping centre is located in the south-eastern part of Odense. The centre dates from 1971 and is the largest in Denmark with 140,000 m2 (1,500,000 sq ft) floor space and more than 150 shops as well as restaurants, a cinema and a fitness centre.[59] A wide variety of shops can be found in the city centre, especially on Kongensgade and Vestergade and adjacent pedestrian streets.[60]Tourism is an important source of income for the city. In 2008 Odense Municipality was listed seventh in Denmark for turnover on tourism, reaching 1.6 million Danish kroner for the year.[61] In 2011, Odense Zoo was Funen's most popular tourist attraction and the eleventh most popular in Denmark with 405,913 visitors.[62] The zoo was founded in 1930 and covers an area of 3.6 hectares (8.9 acres) and has roughly 2,000 animals, covering 147 species.[63] In 2001, Odense Zoo inaugurated a DKK 60 million "Oceanium" featuring South American animal life.Nightlife in the city culminates in Brandts Passage, which contains numerous restaurants, bars and cafes, such as the Envy-Lounge, Australian Bar, Brandts Kladefabrik and Cafe Biografen.[64]  The jazz club, Jazzhus Dexter, is situated on the Vindegade. Other notable nightlife venues include Franck A, Froggys and Club Retro. Restaurants include the Cuckoos Nest bar and restaurant, the Brasserie Klitgaard, the Den Gamle Kro, set in a 17th-century half-timbered house, Kvægtorvet, run by leading chef Klavs Styrbæk who serves fresh fish and meat dishes, which is now closed, and the Under Lindetraet in an 18th-century cottage opposite the Hans Christian Andersen house which serves Franco-Danish cuisine. [65] Hotels of note include the Radisson SAS HC Andersen Hotel, the First Hotel Grand with its brasserie bar, the 68-room Old English-style Clarion Collection Hotel Plaza, City Hotel, which is in close proximity to the Hans Christian Andersen museum, and the 140-room Danhostel Odense City.[16]Nonnebakken, a hill in the Odense area, is the site of one of Denmark's six former Viking ring castles, built during the reign of Sweyn Forkbeard, who had forced his father Harold Bluetooth to leave the country and seek refuge by the Jomsvikings in Wollin (modern Poland) in around 975. The fort provided its occupier the command of the Odense River passing next to the hill. The archaeological remains of the fort were heavily damaged when a building for the Odd Fellow lodge was constructed on the site during the late nineteenth century.[66][67]Odense is the see of the bishop of Funen. Saint Canute's Cathedral (Danish: Sankt Knuds Kirke) was formerly connected with the great Benedictine monastery of the same name, and is one of the largest and finest buildings of its kind in Denmark.[68][69] Originally dating from 1081 to 1093, the church was rebuilt in the 13th century in brick in a pure Gothic style. Under the altar lies Canute  (Danish: Knud), the patron saint of Denmark and his brother on public display. A large fragment of Byzantine cloth is displayed next to the two skeletons. The cathedral also boasts one of Denmark's most remarkable altarpieces, a magnificent triptych by Claus Berg. Kings Jens and Christian II are buried in the city.[70]St Alban's Church, built in the Neogothic style and consecrated in 1908, is the Roman Catholic church of Odense. Its steeple is 54 m (177 ft) high.[71] St Mary's Church (Vor Frue Kirke or Our Lady's Church), built in the 13th century and restored in 1851–1852 and again in 1864, contains a carved 16th-century altarpiece by Claus Berg of Lübeck.[72] St John's Church (Sankt Hans Kirke), first mentioned in 1295, was built by the Knights Hospitaller, also known as the Order of Saint John. Not much of the original building remains as it was rebuilt in 1636 and subsequently restored. Built of red brick with horizontal decorations on the chancel wall, it has large Gothic windows. The date of 1496 on one of the bells in the step-ribbed tower may well be the year the church was completed. The tower is adjacent to Odense Palace which was originally built as a monastery.[73]Ansgars Church was the first church to be built in Odense since the Middle Ages. Completed in 1902, it was designed by Niels Jacobsen in the late Romanesque style in red brick on granite foundations. The cross-shaped interior is complemented by a spired bell-tower, 45 m (148 ft) high.[74] The Peace Church (Fredenskirke) consecrated in 1920 was so named in gratitude for the end of the First World War. The church was the work of Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint who went on to design Copenhagen's Grundtvig's Church.[75]Odense's City Hall (Odense Rådhus), with its medieval Italian look, was designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt and Carl Lendorf in the Historicist style. Completed in 1883, it combines red masonry with sandstone decorations, stepped gables and a saw-tooth course.[76] It stands on the site of a smaller building from 1480.[77] In 1937 Bent Helveg-Møller won the competition for the building's enlargement. The tower over the main entrance was torn down in 1942 but was not rebuilt. As work was delayed during the war, the extension was not completed until 1955. In conjunction with Hans Christian Andersen's 200th anniversary in 2005, comprehensive renovation work was completed on the building's interiors, including the entrance halls, meeting rooms, banqueting hall and council chamber.[78]Odense Palace  was erected by Frederick IV, who died there in 1730. Now an administrative building, it stands on the site of Sankt Hans Kloster, a 15th-century monastery which was transferred to the Crown in 1536.[79] The main white Baroque wing with 13 bays was designed by J.C. Krieger for Frederick IV and completed in 1723.[80] Set in a park, the King's Garden was constructed to a French design by Johan Cornelius Krieger.[81]Odense Teater, first established in 1796, is Denmark's second oldest theatrical enterprise and one of the country's three main theatres. The original building was on Sortebrødre Torv was used until 1914 when a new building designed by Jacobsen was opened on Jernbanegade. It has three stages: Store Scene,  Værkstedet, and Foyerscenen. The theatre also has stages in the former sugar factory Sukkerkogeriet, where it runs the first drama school outside Copenhagen established in 1941.[82] It is notable in theatrical history for staging the première of Henrik Ibsen's first contemporary realist drama The Pillars of Society on 14 November 1877.[83] Teater Momentum or Teater uden Ryglæn, publicly funded by the municipal government and the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, is also of note. Established in 2005, it signs on a new director each year who is charged with creating the "volume" of the year with a set of plays and performers. It also puts on other cultural entertainment including concerts, debates, lectures and poetry.[84]Odense Symphony Orchestra (Odense Symfoniorkester), one of Denmark's five regional orchestras, was formally established in 1946. The orchestra is based in Odense Concert Hall, which was inaugurated in 1982. Most of the orchestra’s concerts are given in the Carl Nielsen Hall, a seating capacity of 1,212 and a large 46-stops organ built by Marcussen & Son.[85] First established in 1948, Funen Opera (Den Fynske Opera) was reopened in 1996 after a period of closure. It specializes in presenting contemporary operas in Danish.[86]Remembered above all for his fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace is the small yellow house on the corner of Hans Jensens Stræde and Bangs Boder in the old town.[87] In 1908 the house was opened as the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. It documents his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures.[88] Andersen's childhood home[89] is on Munkemøllestræde not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little half-timbered house from the age of two until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an exhibition of the cobbling tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.[89]Throughout the city there are numerous statues and sculptures representing characters from the stories of Hans Christian Andersen. They include the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Mermaid, the Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep, the Toad, the Darning Needle, the Emperor's New Clothes, the Sea Horse, the Paper Boat, the Flying Trunk and the Wild Swans.[90] There is also a distinctive statue of Andersen in Eventyrparken (The Fairy Tale Park) beside the cathedral. Sculpted by Louis Hasselriis in 1888, it shows the storyteller with a book in his hand, ready to entertain onlookers with his fairy tales.[91]The museums in Odense are mainly governed by the Odense City Museums, a department of the municipal government. Funen's Art Museum (Fyns Kunstmuseum), formerly The Museum of Funen's Abbey, is one of Denmark's oldest art museums, dating to 1885. It contains the principal works by Jens Juel, Dankvart Dreyer, P.S. Krøyer and H. A. Brendekilde. The open-air The Funen Village museum (Den Fynske Landsby)  tries to emulate what country life was like in Denmark at the time of Andersen's life and contains houses of historical Odense.[92]The Carl Nielsen Museum is dedicated to the life of Carl Nielsen and his wife, the sculptor Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen. It documents his life from his childhood in the town of Nr. Lyndelse, to his career and success on the European music scene, with his violins, his bugle and his grand piano on display, as well as a number of his musical scores, including six symphonies, three concertos, two operas, and chamber music and numerous songs.[93]The Møntergården cultural history museum of Odense is one of the most notable remaining Renaissance buildings of the city, built in 1646 by the nobleman Falk Gøye. It has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in Odense,[16] and is named after the narrow street Møntestræde adjacent to the building, where a coin workshop once operated in around 1420.[94] Located in a courtyard of half-timbered houses, the museum also has exhibits on Funen's ancient history, as well as Odense in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.[95]The Danish Railway Museum is the national railway museum of Denmark, the largest such museum in Scandinavia.

The oldest steam engine dates back to 1869.[96]The Brandts Museum of Photographic Art (Museet for Fotokunst) in Odense is the only national Danish art museum dedicated specifically to photographic art. It was founded on 13 September 1985 as part of the Brandts International Centre for Art and Culture and opened its own exhibition space in 1987.[97] The Media Museum of Odense documents the history of the freedom of speech in Denmark since 1849, and the development of the printing press and the history of Danish broadsheet Berlingske.[98]Odense University, established by law in 1964, was the first of three new provincial universities created to relieve pressure on the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus. Teaching began in 1966. By the end of the 20th century, there were 11,000 students and some 5,000 employees. Before it became part of the University of Southern Denmark in 1998, it had four faculties covering arts, medicine, and natural and social sciences. The university building which opened in 1971 was designed by KHR Arkitekter.[99]The University of Southern Denmark (Syddansk Universitet) was established in 1998 as a merger of Odense University, the Southern Denmark Business School (Handelshøjskole Syd), the Southern Engineering School (Ingeniørhøjskole Syd) and the South Jutland University Centre (Sydjysk Universitetscenter). The main campus is in Odense but there are also departments in Copenhagen, Esbjerg, Kolding, Slagelse and Sønderborg. With some 26,000 students (2012), the establishment is Denmark's third largest university.[100] The Faculty of Engineering (Det Tekniske Fakultet) combines several institutions: Odense Maskinteknikum (a mechanical engineering college which was established in 1905 and in 1962 became the Southern Engineering School), the Mads Clausen Institute and the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute.[101]Odense also includes departments of the University College Lillebaelt headquartered in Vejle. The university is the result of a merger between several further education institutions on Funen and in Jelling, Vejle and Svendborg.[102] UCL is currently undertaking comprehensive renovation of the buildings on Niels Bohrs Allé from the 1960s where it will concentrate its Odense interests. It intends to open University College Lillebælt Campus Odense in August 2014.[103]Aimed at improving employment opportunities in business, the Lillebaelt Academy of Professional Higher Education (Erhvervsakademiet Lillebælt) was established in 2009 as a result of a merger between Tietgen Business College, SDE college, Kold College and Vejle Business College. In 2014, it had 3,200 students and a staff of 300. Its programmes are offered at various locations in Odense and Vejle.[104] Under the auspices of the municipality, the Odense School of Music (Odense Musikskole) offers educational courses with an emphasis on music to children and young people up to the age of 25.[105]Kold College is a privately run institution offering vocational courses in food, agriculture and gardening. Founded in 2004, after a merger between Datum Tekniske Skole and Gartnerskolen Søhus, it changed its name to Kold College in 2008. It also offers secondary education courses in the natural sciences.[106] The college is named after Christen Kold who founded vocational schools on Funen in the mid-19th century.[107]Funen Art Academy is an independent, nationally recognized educational institution located in the Brandts complex in central Odense which offers 5-year course in the visual arts.[108]Odense is home to eight gymnasiums (Grammar schools), 21 state grade schools as well as a number of private schools.[109][110]Odense's most important football clubs are Odense Boldklub (OB), BK Marienlyst (BM), B1909, and B1913.  OB has a history going back to 1887 when it was founded as Odense Kricketklub (Odense Cricket Club). It changed its name to Odense Boldklub in 1893 after football was included in its activities. The club has won three national championships, and five cup titles.[111] The club play their home matches at Odense Stadium, also known as Odense Stadion. BK Marienlyst, founded in 1922, are in the Danish 2nd Division, and play their home matches at Marienlystcentret, which has a capacity of 1,200.[112] The club also has a notable volleyball team. RC Odense represents the city at rugby in combination with Lindø RSC.[113]The Odense Bulldogs are a professional ice hockey team based in Odense. They play in the top Danish League Metal Ligaen, as the only team from Funen.[114] In tennis, Tennis Club Odense is located near the Odense River.[115] The country's largest tennis centre is due to open in Marienlyst in 2014.[116]The H.C. Andersen Marathon is held annually in Odense.[117] On Ascension Sunday, children can participate in Eventyrløbet (the Fairy Tale Run) with circuits from 2.5 to 10 km.[118]There are many smaller sports clubs in Odense covering athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing, climbing, cycling, fencing, football, golf, gymnastics, handball, jujitsu, karate, riding, roller-skating, shooting, swimming, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, yoga and wrestling as well as several specialising in facilities for people with disabilities.[119]In early December 2017,[120] the ESL Pro League Season 6 finals were held in the 4,000-seat Arena Fyn. The event would return to Odense for its Season 8 finals, won by the hometown heroes Astralis, in December 2018. The season 10 offline finals of ESL Pro League were also held in the city.The Port of Odense consists of three main basins and a number of facilities along the canal, with quays measuring roughly 4,200 metres (13,800 ft) in length in total.[121] Vessels up to a length of 160 metres (520 ft) and a draft of 6.8 metres (22 ft) are facilitated in the port. The wharf for tankers is situated outside the harbour on the southern side of the canal, with facilities for tankers, general cargo ships, bulk, and LPG ships, and has a depth of 7.5 metres (25 ft).[121]Accessibility to Odense was greatly increased when the ferry service between the two main Danish islands, Zealand and Funen, was replaced by the Great Belt Bridge – opened in 1997 for rail traffic, 1998 for road traffic. When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as an hour and a quarter.[122]Odense's main railway station Odense Station lies on the line between Copenhagen and Jutland, the peninsular mainland. International trains connect the town with Hamburg in Germany.[123] Local and regional trains link Odense to the rest of Denmark. A separate passenger railway, Svendborgbanen, operates between Odense and Svendborg. Formerly, railways connected Odense to most of Funen's coastal cities, but these links were closed down in the 1950s and 1960s.[124] Today, these regional routes are served by buses operated by the public company FynBus, which also operates the town's municipal bus service, connecting the town's suburbs to the city centre.[125] On 28 May 2022, Odense’s new tram line entered service. A 14.5 km double-track line runs from Tarup in the northwest to the station, Syddansk Universitet, a hospital, and Hjallese in the south, with 26 stops. Possible extensions are under consideration.[126]By road, Odense connects to Zealand and Jutland with the Funish Motorway (Fynske Motorvej), a section of the E20,[127] and to Svendborg on the southern part of Funen by way of the Svendborg Motorway (Svendborgmotorvejen), which comprises the Danish Route 9.[128] Other, smaller routes connect Odense to the rest of Funen, with direct links to all coastal towns.[129]In 2015 plannings were established on Denmark's first Diverging diamond interchange (DDI), called "Dynamisk Ruderanlæg", upgrading the diamond interchange number 52 on Fynske Motorvej (E20), crossing the roadways of Assesvej by following the American design of DDIs at 55°21′41″N 10°20′42″E﻿ / ﻿55.361287°N 10.344932°E﻿ / 55.361287, 10.344932[130][131] On 17 September 2017, the redesigned interchange opened for traffic.[132][133][134] Computer aided simulation and land usage resulted the DDI as the adequate solution.[135]Odense is served by Odense Airport, which operates flights to tourist resorts, mainly in the summer months.[136]In 2016, the city of Odense, Denmark implemented a new form of technology to allow for more efficient bike travel. Often, when it is raining heavily, cyclists have had to sit in the rain for long periods of time at traffic lights, and this disincentives them to cycle to work that day. To fix this problem, Odense has placed rain sensors in traffic lights along their super bike highways. These sensors interact with motion detectors which "allow the system to register when bikes are within 70 meters of the intersection."[137] They then automatically prolong the green light. The intersection includes a small sign that explains the system to the cyclists, and when a light goes on, they can see the system is functioning. This technology allows cyclists to experience up to 20 seconds longer of green light, and makes their overall journey more efficient, safer, and dryer.The Cycling Embassy of Denmark is the organization spearheading this research and initiatives. While there isn't a lot of criticism due to the cyclist culture that is already fairly dominant in Odense, those who commute in cars would be naturally upset by the longer red lights. However, the Embassy believes that there should not be too much pushback because of the equity issue involved with being exposed to the rain versus being sheltered in a car.[138]  It will also only be utilized up to 3 times a month.This initiative does not only optimize the corridor flow and speed for cyclists, it reinforces the "green wave" .[139] The green wave is known as the ability to cycle through several intersections without having to stop. This is the overall thought the Cycling Embassy had in installing rain sensors, as they hope to implement the technology in other intersections of the city, creating an efficient city-wide system of sustainable transit. Eventually, riding a bike will be easier than riding a car.The Odense University Hospital (OUH), established in 1912,[140] is of major regional importance, not only for healthcare, but for conducting research in collaboration with the Institute of Clinical Research of the University of Southern Denmark.[141] OUH is the largest hospital unit in Denmark and the largest employer in Odense, and as of 2006 it had 1200 beds and a staff of 7700 people, of which 1300 people were doctors. Today there are about 10,000 employees covering all fields of medicine.[140] The hospital tower block is 57 metres (187 ft) high, has 15 floors and is Odense's tallest building.[142]  It is the principal hospital for the northern part of Funen but also takes patients from all over Denmark, as it has highly specialized units within hand replantation surgery and special neuro-radiological intervention.The Hans Christian Andersen Children’s Hospital, part of the OUH, is the only paediatric department on the island of Funen, and also conducts research into nutrition and gastrointestinal diseases, asthma and allergies, hormonal diseases and others. As of 2013, the children's hospital had consisted of seven wards and had 377 employees, with about 10,000 admissions and 25,000 annual outpatient visits annually.[143] A new DKK 6.3 billion hospital is under construction in closer proximity to the University of Southern Denmark, scheduled to be completed in 2018. The hospital will have a floor area of 212,000 square metres (2,280,000 sq ft).[144]Odense is home to several other private hospitals, including Privathospitalet H. C. Andersen Klinikken,[145] Privathospitalet Hunderup,[146] and Privathospitalet Mariahjemmet.[147]Odense is the centre for media activity on Funen, and the hub of the regional network. Its principal newspaper is Fyens Stiftstidende, a daily broadsheet owned by Den Fynske Bladfond and published by Fyens Stiftstidende A/S, which was established on 3 January 1772.[148] Until 1841 the newspaper was known as Kongelig Priviligerede Odense Adresse-Contoirs Efterretninger, and on 13 April 1993 the newspaper changed its 221-year-old tradition as a midday newspaper, to a morning paper. In 2013, it had an average circulation of 47,738, down from some 60,500 in 2005.[149] The editor in chief, Per Westergård, chairs the board of the Centre for Journalism at the University of Southern Denmark, one of the two university journalism departments in Denmark.[150][151] Denmark's largest university press, the University Press of Southern Denmark, is also based in Odense. It was founded in 1966 as Odense University Press (Odense Universitetsforlag), and its authors are mainly academics from the University of Southern Denmark.[152]The television station TV 2, fully owned by the state since 2003, is based in Odense. The station began broadcasting on 1 October 1988 as a privately owned company, thereby ending the television monopoly previously exercised by the Danmarks Radio (DR).[153] Since 2007, TV 2 has had about 1,000 employees. Now operating six channels, TV 2 now broadcasts over 40,000 hours of television programmes per year.[154]Odense has 28 twin cities.[201] For a full list of twin cities, see Odense Municipality.
