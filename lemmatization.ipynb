      "Baron Beauchamp\n",
      "=======================================\n",
      "   The titles Baron Beauchamp and Viscount Beauchamp have been created several times throughout English and British history. There is an extant Viscountcy of Beauchamp, held by the Seymour family, Marquesses of Hertford.  The name Beauchamp (French \"beautiful/fair field\"), Latinised to de Bello Campo (\"from the beautiful field/fair field\"), is borne by three of the most ancient Anglo-Norman families which settled in England during the Norman Conquest of 1066: Beauchamp of Worcestershire, of Somerset and of Bedfordshire.[5] The surname was taken from their respective manors in Normandy and there is no evidence of any shared origin between the families of that name seated in those three separate counties. The Bedfordshire branch died out in the male line after only two generations. The heir of the Somerset branch was the powerful Seymour family, whilst the Worcestershire branch achieved the greatest power and prominence as Earls of Warwick.  (Descendants of the feudal barons of Hatch Beauchamp in Somerset)  The barony was unsuccessfully claimed in 1924 by Ulric Oliver Thynne.  This was the first barony created by letters patent, by King Richard II in 1387.[6] They were seated at Holt Castle, Worcestershire, a junior branch of the senior Elmley line.  Descended from Walter de Beauchamp (died 1303/6) of Beauchamp's Court, Alcester in Warwickshire and of Beauchamp Court, Powick in Worcestershire, Steward of the Household to King Edward I and  younger brother of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick (c.1238-1298), the first of his family to hold that title (inherited from their mother).  The Seymour family inherited the capital manor of Hatch Beauchamp (anciently Hache) due to the marriage of Roger Seymour (d.c.1361) to Cecily Beauchamp (d.1393), the aunt and heiress of John IV de Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp (1330-1361),[7] feudal baron of Hatch Beauchamp.
